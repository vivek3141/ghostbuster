It was a dull tuesday morning when I woke up to the sounds of my phone going off non-stop. Aaron was frantically screaming nonsense at me. "THERE IS A NUMBER...Errr...SOMETHING IS ON ME JOSH!" I mumbled and turned on my side to go back to my dreams, but that is when I saw it. There in the mirror, it was right on top of me. A shiny green **1**. I thought I was seeing things, I **had** to still be dreaming! I reached up and tried to touch it, but nothing was there to feel. My shaking hand pierced through the number and it stayed exactly where it was.
I showered to clear my head and let the brisk water wash away the thoughts of this mysterious symbol above my dome. What did it mean anyways? Then it happened. A loud crack and mumble that seemed to fill the air. The water stopped. All I could do is stand there, naked and sopping wet. I just wished it would all go away! Why me? And what about Aaron too? I sprinted through my apartment to reach my phone. I dialed as fast as I could, but the lines were dead now. What was happening!? I have to go find him.
Everything outside is hectic! Everybody is running around with no idea what to do. *8,724 500 153,475 28* I tried to see the pattern but there was nothing. I hopped on my bike to find Aaron, but not before seeing it. **The red number**. I tried to clear it from my head but it was all I could think about. **Number 1,356,752**. I only got a glimpse, but the second I saw him, I knew something was off. I got to Aaron's, and to my excitement, he was completely alright. **Number 64,814**. He wouldn't stop staring at my **1**, but he knew nothing more than I did. A helicopter flew by with loud speakers screaming to "GET TO THE STADIUM: AVOID THE RED AT ALL COSTS." *Avoid the red* It buzzed through my head a million times. We packed up some clothes and headed to the stadium with no idea what to do.
29 days passed by as the green numbers got lower. I was in charge, I was number 1. The red seemed to tear a person apart, that is, if you count them as a person anymore. Every second, **1,000** people went red. It was sad watching those who had numbers in the millions go, counting down to those of us on the low end. By my calculations, I had about 81 days from the day I was chosen, until I went red. Aaron was still with me, but his time was on its way. The clock was ticking.
7 days remain. We are thinking about zoning people off, but I just can't leave him. Our day is coming and my best friend is only going to change a minute before me. Our quarantine zone is falling to pieces with the reds pounding the walls to get in. The top 10 have been meeting to eradicate the problem, but these are our friends! 3 and 8 were in a heated debate about whether to start killing them off or not. "WHO CARES 8! They are red and they are staying that way! You remember the zoning mishap for the 39,506,000's don't you?" "How could anyone forget, they hadn't turned yet bu-" "THE REDS TORE THEM TO SHREDS! These are savages out there." "We don't know if there is an end to this or no-" "There is an end." I interjected. The entire room silenced. "We ARE the end. We all have known this since the day we saw the countdown." It was then when 2 stepped in. Her voice filled the room sounding like an angel, speaking the words of the devil. "We are dying. The walls are crumbling. What is left for us to do? What happens when we kill them off?" 6 could barely sit still he was shaking so much. I looked around the room, 9 unfamiliar faces who had become my family. I cared about them, but how much longer could that last. "Our friends are out there. Our families too! Who cares if we live another 7 days. We have to put them to rest. That is the risk that I am willing to take, but if you aren't, sit pretty under your little number. It is time to take our Earth back, no matter the cost." Everything froze.
10 was the only one moving. He gave me a little slow clap and a *bravo*. He began to circle the table in his luxurious pinstripe suit, but everybody else was stuck in place. He reached 9 and with a little flick, turned her number **red**. "You couldn't have possibly thought you were the real *number 1* could you?" I tried to utter out a cry, but I was paralyzed. Who is he? He went down the line and stopped at each person. "8, what a waste of power!" **RED** "7, he barely speaks" **RED** "6, well I actually quite liked him, but nevertheless" **RED** "5 may be beautiful, but her brain is definitely not helping anybody out here" **RED** I was furious, straining to move, but nothing. "Don't struggle honey, It won't get you anywhere." He kept his charade up. "4, She and I were actually seeing eachother...hmph, oh well!" **RED** That is when he stopped at 3. He popped his hands on 3's shoulders and sighed. "3 is the ONLY one who was willing to do anything savage, get his hands dirty. Sure you gave a good speech, but what were you really going to do? Gather an army and sneak off with 2 right before the fight? Exactly." **RED** He walked by 2 and without even a mention, smacked her number to join the rest of the crimson room. He sat right in front of me and just let me simmer in the murder of my friends. "Now I know what you are wondering, just who am I? Well they call me *Red* as it may be. You are not the first planet I have done this too and you will not be the last. The best part about all of this? Watching you be ripped limb-from-limb by your friends and your girlfriend. Oh but I almost forgot!" He snapped his grimy fingers and the door popped open to a dark hallway. He released us all from our sitting prison. The last thing I saw was a piercing red 64,814 beaming through the hallway.
