"What does this mean?" I said.
"Oh, your son got the rules card. He's gonna be a lawyer," the cardman replied.
"I'd like to draw a different card, please."
The cardman looked back at me with a scowl, "you dare give me an order?"
"No. No, sir. It's just that...I've read stuff online, about," he paused, lowering his voice, "the suitless."
A grin creased across the cardman's face, "so, you have something to say about that?"
"Umm, yes," I said in a moment of bravery, "yes. I umm, I want him to be normal."
"But this is normal," the cardman returned.
"No, I mean, umm, he'd be suitless, you know? And you have to be suited to live a normal life. Please sir, how much can I pay you, give him a chance. Please," I said, despondent.
The cardman wheeled around on his heel to leave, but paused mid-stride. He turned slowly, "are you a suitist, sir?"
"No! No, it's just that, my wife and I want grandkids and...umm...like this, he uhh, he couldn't even marry a two of cups, she's gonna be crushed. Please," I begged.
He glared at me, clenched his fist, and cut our distance to mere feet and whispered, "you *are* a suitist. And you can't see how bigoted that sounds," he said, leaning in, "guess what asshole, I was a blank and I'm better off than you, and he will be too."
"I'm, umm...sorry for how coarse I sounded," I said, not quite having the words.
"No, you aren't. And maybe you won't. You're sorry for being called out on it. It's easier to love a bigot than to reform one, though. Take care of your son, and know that the *suitless* have love for all cards, not just the right ones. Treat him well," he said as he wheeled and walked out.
I looked down at my baby boy, "huh."
