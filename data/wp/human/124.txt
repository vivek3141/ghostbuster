I wake up at my desk. My stapler is gone. Somebody took it.
Who am I?
There's a note.
'I didn't want to interrupt your nap but I took your stapler. I'll have it back soon, or you can come get it if you need it"
There's no signature.
I walk through the aisles in the cubicles. Who are these people. They nod at me? Do they know me?
Do I know them?
I see desks without staplers. Did someone take their staplers too?
Someone is preying on staplers.
I will find it. I'll have it back.
Someone walks by.
"Have you seen my stapler?"
"Uhm no"
My stapler could be anywhere.
I come back to my cubicle. My stapler is still gone. There's something different about my cubicle.
While I was gone someone lined with paper, drawings all over. A man with a weird tie, a boss with pointy hair.
There's a sign.
It says 'they took my swing line' under a picture of a red stapler.
Someone's taunting me.
"Uhm, what are you doing in my cubicle?"
A voice behind me. I turn around. He looks just like me.
Well he's white and thirty and wearing a shirt and tie.
We're actually pretty different now that I think about it.
"Sorry" I say.
This mad man is affecting all of us.
Where is my cubicle? I wander until I recognize the scenery. My stapler is back. I look up.
Someone's walking away from cubicle. I can't see there face.
I run after them.
They walk into an office. Try to shut the door. I don't know if I'll make it in time.
I burst through the door.
"Oh hey, Bob" says the man at the desk.
I think his name is Larry.
"I put the stapler back in the right cubicle right. I stare at him. He flaunts it in my face.
"Did you uh…did you need something"
I keep staring. He has to break soon.
"If this is about me catching you napping we actually encourage short naps. You can use the break room if you want, just uh…just don't abuse it"
This man is a sociopath.
"Yeah I don't mean to be rude but if there's nothing else I'm kind of busy so…"
I leave, go back to my cubicle.
My staplers gone again.
There's another note.
"Sorry, you were away, needed your stapler for a sec. Come get it if you need"
There's a name.
Frank.
