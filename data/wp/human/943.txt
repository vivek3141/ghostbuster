From the very walls he came, invading my home. When I awoke this morning I didn't know I would be fighting for my life, all to keep him away from what I was sworn to protect. I wasn't prepared the injuries, god the injuries, I don't know how much longer I can hold off this invader, how much longer I can survive, I can barely move. He turned my house into a weapon, riddled with cruel traps of his design. Where did he even get explosives, how'd he learn to maneuver my home better than I ever could? I can hardly get a good look at him, he managed to turn every pursuit, every capture, every time I thought I was near victory into another opportunity to destroy a part of me, staying only long enough to gleefully carry out his punishment. The sadistic bastard! But I have a duty! Right here, in this room, in front of the fridge he has fought to hard to raid, bloodied and mangled, I make my last stand. You will rue this day Jerry, you will know that this house is protected and the name Tom will burn in your memory as your worst nightmare.
