"Wow, he is everything I've always dreamed of. Slightly tall, dark hair, long fingers, a nose that is large but noble in a way, even endearing mole on the cheek. And that voice...there has to be something wrong with him. He can't be this perfect."
::Sex begins::
"Wow, she's really professional, look at how into it she is. The way her eyes look at me, the way her body thrusts against me with passion I've never felt in my life...She is really good at her job!"
"Oh God, I'm cumming so hard. I've never been with a man like this. It's like my body and soul were was made for his."
"Wow, she really looks like she's cumming. Jesus, if I didn't know better, I'd think she actually was. What a professional. If only I could have this kind of passion in real life.
::scene ends, they clean up::
The beautiful Amanda compliments him on his performance both with words and a look in her eyes that instantly pierces and melts his heart.
"Wow, she's still in character. Professional til the end. If only any of this was real. If only I can have half the happiness I had with just 20 minutes with her, how beautiful life would be.
Fuck this gay earth."
