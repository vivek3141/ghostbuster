"Bubby likes hot pockets," said the young boy in the grocery aisle beside his devoted mother.
"I know you do, Buddy," said the mother. "But we are having dinner with the Fox family tonight, so I don't want to spoil your appetite."
"But, Bubby wants hot pockets," he said with a pout on his face. He reached for the item on the shelf., but his mother stopped him. Then he began to chant. "Hot pockets. Hot pockets. Hot pockets!"
Rhonda Carlyle was stocking shelves when the wailing began. She had a terrible migraine. The woman and her spoiled brat were driving the blade through her brain. The wailing showed no sign of letting up. Her manager, Sasha was nowhere to be seen, and probably making herself scarce to avoid having to deal with the situation. The other customers were too polite to say anything, avoiding them like little fish avoid a big shark.
"Ma'am," said Rhonda, "could you please calm your child down? He's disturbing the other customers."
The woman turned to look at Rhonda with the darkest look of loathing a human could muster. "Who the hell do you think you are?"
"I'm just saying..."
"You ain't sayin' nuthin', bitch!" The woman hauled off and socked Rhonda on the nose.
Rhonda stepped back, shocked and in more pain than before. Against the migraine, her nose was trying hard to take first place in the agony ratings.
"Bubby, wants a hot pocket, now!"
"You have to leave the store," said Rhonda, trying to stanch the flow of blood with her only good handkerchief. "Leave now, or I'm calling the cops."
"Go right ahead," said the mother with a sneer. "This is my husband's beat and he's on duty, so don't expect the cops to help you out."
"Oh God, I wish people like you would just shrivel up and die!"
So they did. All of them. The ravens will be feasting in the morning.
