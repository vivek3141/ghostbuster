"Been a while, hasn't it?"
Jesus. Was that the best I could do? I'd had ten years to think up a line and *that* was it?
Ah well. The reaction was still the same, thankfully. Open mouths. Stares of shock. Someone dropping a glass. All as I'd hoped.
"Matt, man? Fuck, we thought you were dead, dude," said Jimmy. Not the smartest around, Jimmy. You'd see brighter sparks on the end of the toke perpetually dangling from his lips.
"So did I, to be honest. You know how long I was in those ruins? Or have you forgotten already?"
Sam cut me off. "Come on, man, don't be like this. We thought you were --"
"Going to die? Is that what you were going to say?"
"But that poison...That was guaranteed to kill you!"
"Thanks for the reminder, Charlie. I noticed as I was writhing in agony."
Damn it. Even after all those practices, I couldn't hide how bitter I was. Cold and detached, Matt. You got this. Time to play your trump card.
"I wonder exactly how you knew that, Charlie. Could it be because of this?" I pulled the glass bottle from my pocket. Charlie's eyes widened, though whether it was with fear or realisation I couldn't tell.
"It wasn't the dart in the temple that had poison in it, was it, Charlie? It was the soup you oh-so-lovingly made for me. Wasn't it?"
Charlie couldn't talk. He was clutching his throat. As were Sam and Jimmy, actually.
"The soup you all made together to help a friend in need, yes?"
Tears were streaming down their faces now.
"In any case, I decided to repay your *gratitude* with a present. Mixed into the beer you all just drained."
Charlie had already collapsed, the bastard. Jimmy and Sam were still hanging on, though.
"You should have invited me to the reunion."
Not sure why I said that. No one was left to hear it. Maybe it was just for therapeutic purposes. After all...
Ten years with the knowledge your best friends tried to kill you doesn't exactly help the anger management.
