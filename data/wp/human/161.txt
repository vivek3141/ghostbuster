"You've reached Danny's deliveries. How may I help you?"
"Put down the gun, Patricia. We're outside the store. We are willing to end this negotiation peacefully."
"Sir, if you're outside the store, maybe you'd like to come in."
"We don't want the situation to escalate. Stay calm."
"I'm calm," said Patricia. "Is your order for now or later?"
"On the behalf of the Miami district police, we order and suggest you to remain calm right now. Miami police district is willing to negotiate."
"Umm, alright sir. What would you like then?"
"We'd like you to let the hostages go."
"Sorry?"
"We'll give you the money. So long as you allow all of the hostages to leave safely."
"Sir, the only thing being held hostage here is quality pizzas at affordable prices."
"Ma'am, we know you're confused. We'd like you to step outside the building."
"As soon as I have your food ready, our trusty staff will bring you pizza, sides and drinks right away. I'd suggest pepperoni."
"Rob, we've got the wrong Danny's." "Shit!"
"...Sir?"
