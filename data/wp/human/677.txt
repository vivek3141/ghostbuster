"Welcome, brother. I see that you have arrived at your final destination," boasted Saint Peter.
"What about my family, friends?"
Peter smiles and nods his head, halo shimmering as he does so. "Let me show you something."
Peter takes my hand and guides me through the pristine arches. It's quiet, a peaceful calm that floats gracefully in the air. I can't see any other souls or angels but I know I'm not alone.
We enter a grand hall, something out of a fairytale. Gold and silver so bright that I can barely keep my eyes open. Peter leads me to a table in the center of the room. A photo album rests alone.
"Go ahead," proclaimed Peter.
I slowly opened the leather bound album. The first page held a photo of a woman in a hospital bed holding a baby. I had to squint for my eyes to focus on the page.
"And you know who that is, right?" asked Peter.
"This is my mother holding me when I was born."
I flipped through more pages, memories flooding back, reliving each and every moment of my life. Birthdays, family get-togethers, vacations. They were all here contained in this photo album.
Another page turned. "What is this?" I asked.
"Ahh, yes." remarked Peter. His interest peaked.
The picture seemed over-exposed, too much light. It was of me and someone I couldn't quite make out. We were standing close, hands clasped tight. "Saint Peter, who is this? Where is this?"
"It's a funny thing. You can find little pieces of heaven everywhere, even on Earth."
I looked at Peter and slowly closed the album. He made the slightest gesture with his head. I turned and saw a beautiful angel in white standing close by. As I approached she began to smile. She took my hand. Tears were streaming down my face.
"I thought I'd never see you again," I said.
We hug.
"I told you to come find me when the time came."
I now knew that my world was complete. I held her tight as I caressed the ring on her finger. She did the same.
