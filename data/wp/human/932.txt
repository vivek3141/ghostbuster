"Don't start with me."
"Don't start? *Don't start? * I think you've lost track of how important you are, Jonn."
"Oh, I never lost track of that. Here, listen, I've got it all figured out. I...am insane!"
John coughed. "What did you say?"
"I'm insane! I'm insane. I didn't create a way to view other dimensions through the mirror in my bathroom! It was all a delightful failure, prolonged by a chemical imbalance in my brain." Jonn was extremely hungover, but he was also in the happiest mood he'd ever had since the day he was married.
"You're not making sense. This wasn't even your work to start with, remember? You took it from PRI Labs, from the laboratory in the third basement floor..."
"I don't have to know how it works. That's for the some psychiatrist to figure out. All I know is that my wife wants me back, Mr. Reflection John. And I'm going to do whatever it takes to keep her."
John leaned forward. "Seeing a psychologist isn't going to make my problems go away, Jonn. You're the only one who can keep the collapse of my universe from happening. You need to keep working."
"Work, work, work! That's all you ever want me to do! Maybe I don't have time for your work, huh? Maybe I have an *actual job* and an *actual marriage* that are getting ruined by your pestering me all the time! And maybe **working all the time on what you think is important doesn't make you real! **"
"Jonn?"
"Marsha?" Jonn turned from the mirror. This wasn't how he wanted to bring up his mental problem. "Uhh, look, I can explain."
"Explain what?" Marsha's face went white from shock. "The fact that I don't have a reflection, or the fact that yours can talk?"
