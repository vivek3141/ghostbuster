It was the very first time I'd ever flown.
The excitement before takeoff was palpable; you could feel the electricity in the air. My fellow travellers were just as excited to go as I was, I could tell.
I felt the engines power up, and soon enough they roared to life, shooting us upwards, gracefully into the sky. Before long, we were soaring off into the azure blue frontier, passing by birds, rushing through fluffy white clouds. Below, the city shrunk rapidly, its inhabitants shrinking to the size of ants, then specks.
I had waited my whole life to fly. I'd never had the opportunity before now, and as I sped through the air, I was exhilarated by the sheer incredible speed. It was a pity that the flight had to be as short as it was, but that was something well beyond my control.
After all, an ICBM only takes 30 minutes to reach its target.
