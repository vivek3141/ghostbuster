Not in second person, but here it is:
Hours had gone by before she dared to look back. The blisters on her blue feet were collecting small stones and filth as she scurried across the desert floor.
"What have I done?" she thought. She had left behind everything she had known, including her responsibilities as a mother.
"Coward" she cursed. "Coward!" She would have cried if she were not so afraid, ears ringing from the gunshots.
