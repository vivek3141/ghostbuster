*But wait, why would anyone hold a surprise party for me? It's not even my birthday or anything. Also, I don't really have a lot of friends, so this doesn't make sense*, I thought. I then got into my car and started driving. Eventually I got out of the city. I kept going until I ran out of gas. *It seems everyone is just gone. Am I really the only one here? * â€” I couldn't believe what was happening.
I tried to call my brother, but he never answered. Then my phone turned itself off. I was worried, I was scared, I was angry. I didn't want to be the only one. I refused to accept that as the reality. I started walking, through the middle of nowhere, until I found a little house. It was empty, of course. I got inside, and grabbed a drink from the kitchen. Then I noticed the TV was still on.
I sat on the couch, and passed out while listening to the static. I don't remember anything else.
