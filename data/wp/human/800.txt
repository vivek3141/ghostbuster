"Okay, what the fuck?"
"What?"
"You shot my evil sidekick.".
"He had a gun."
"A confusion Ray! It would have made you dizzy."
"Self defense."
"What?"
"I shot him in self defense."
"You're not even bothered that you just killed another human being? His name was Jeff. He had a life, a fianc√©. I had dinner with them last week. He was just helping me because he needed something on his resume. Holy shit man."
"He was evil, like you. I show no pity for those who seek to harm others."
"Harm others? I built a giant magnet that stole everyone's spare change in town. The most it would have done was harm their piggy banks."
"Stealing is stealing."
"Know what? Fuck this, arrest me, take me in. I'm going to tell the world what you did."
"No you aren't."
"Excuse me? Wait drop the gun. Don't do anything rash. *No-*."
