All along the horizon the fires were burning, and still Harald knew that it was not enough. He found a tree and limped over to it, his sword still gripped in his once good hand, now covered in blood. The blade itself was battered and blunted, the sword had been used more like an ax than anything else, chopping and hacking through the crowds.
He fell onto the ground beneath the tree, his back resting against it's hard bark. In the distance, below the smoke and the fire trails, they were moving. Despite looking human they were something else, demons given solid form perhaps, but certainly not human. Certainly not alive. Certainly not dead.
Harald wanted to bound to his feet. He wanted to lift his sword yet again in a final embrace with death, but he could not. His arm wouldn't listen. His feet wouldnt so much as twitch, and deep down he knew, the end was upon him. Hell itself had come to Aengland, and all Harald could do was watch as it descended upon him.
