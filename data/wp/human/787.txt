It came as a surprise to everyone, something like a child's first lie. Innocent Jack, the perfect citizen - born and raised on righteousness, was malformed. Metamorphose, dread and blasphemy. It happened as he was walking there one day, trampling himself down to the shoe sole, imprisoned by all this introvert hatred, this most inner magma pool of self destruction layered as the rim of his life; yes, he a had stood there with the knife against his heart and whispered, plead to the hatred one last time, just to realize - he could be free, he could just let it go, release it and let it rip. Let the volcano erupt. A mushroom clouds deliverance. And just as intense as he had once wished for himself to burn he now wanted to set the world ablaze, see it all through a haze of black smoke and feel it running like peeled ash between his fingers. He wanted it all to be lost, that nothing would return or be remembered. He wanted to become death, the destroyer of worlds, so that he could bring the knife closer, convinced that it was the only right thing left to do.
