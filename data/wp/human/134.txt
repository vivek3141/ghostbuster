"It's not posting."
"What's not?" I put down my book and looked over at my girlfriend, on the computer again.
"My fic. It's giving me this weird error. Error number yadda-yadda-yadda â€˜ not enough free space.'What do you think it means?"
"Is this your serialized fanfiction?"
"Yeah, I've posted it every day and this is the first time it's ever had an issue."
I walked over and kicked her off the computer. I clicked the submit button. Yep, same error. I go to google something, but the google page has been replaced with a message:
*We have deleted a significant amount of our cache data to place this message. The internet is full. It happened about 1am PST this morning. Running diagnostics, we have determined the culprit. An astonishing 74% of the data currently clogging the internet is something called "Hello Kitty: Friendship is Magic." We would delete it, but it's not hosted on our servers. The following is a petition to get the guilty party to remove the content, so that the internet may once again flow freely. *
This was followed by a count containing 3 billion signatures.
I turn to my girlfriend. "Hey, good news. Three billion people know about your writing."
