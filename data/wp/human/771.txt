I looked across at dad at the breakfast table- he gave one of those manly shrug nods, all rolled into one. He knew, of course he knew, every man had gone through it. It was like a rite of passage.
Smirking he said, "it's just the change son, don't let it get to you too much. It frightened your Uncle Allen that he ran into traffic to make his life more exciting..." at that he returned to his paper.
"Why don't we get taught it at school?" I nervously asked.
An ignorant shrug and a russell of paper told him that the conversation was over. This was obviously one of those things that "you don't talk about."
I returned to my cereal, clumping in the bowl, "well at least I don't have to go through that puberty thing..." I mumbled under my breath.
Dad looked over his paper muttering, "you think you hear horror stories of puberty, you're not out of the woods yet with this change- let hope you get through it in one piece eh?" He crunched down on a butter laden crumpet, shuffling paper again.
My face was horrified, and there wasn't anyone else I could ask...
