A change of clothing, canned tuna, a loaded revolver, and a full tank of gas on his red '76 Mustang Cobra, that's all Thomas needed to start a new life.
He revved up the engine and drove west, out to face his destiny.
As he drove out of town, he passed through a lot of places where he grew up. He passed the old arcade where he once spent $5 in quarters just placing with his friends from sun up to sun down, caring only about beating each other's high-scores. He drove by his old elementary where he once starred as "the wolf" in his class play of The Little Red Riding Hood when he was 8. He drove by the carpentry shop where he and friend got their first job.
None of this mattered to him anymore; all ties to the past have been severed. Thomas did not look and reminisce at the memories he was leaving behind. All he could do is look forward and think about the future. Whatever it held for him, his past had nothing to do with it.
As he drove up a hill and down the other side, his old life, his old town faded from the rear view mirror. Thomas not once looked back, not even when making a lane change.
