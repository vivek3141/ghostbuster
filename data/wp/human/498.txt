I've chosen the victim,
My first immolation,
To Ytripef--god of the scare
*I'll frighten his nightmares,
I'll cause isolation,
I'll drive him to rip out his hair! *
I've planned every moment,
All possible futures,
The city is mapped end to end
*By the time I am done,
He'll need mentalist sutures;
A psyche that never will mend*
I've waited ten lifetimes,
To prove to my master,
I have what it takes to affright
*After this I'll be free,
An endless disaster,
I just need success here tonight*
I feel it approaching,
Like Destiny's herald,
The hour and moment of truth
*My victim will enter,
His life then imperiled--
And I just have to* frighten *the youth! *
I revel in glory,
The foregone conclusion,
Of winning my freedom and right
*To roam across nations,
Cause shock and confusion,
I just need success here tonight*
At long last he appears,
The key turns in the door,
I prepare for the blood to start flowing
*He steps into the room,
And I hiss and I roar;
He yawns and says, "Hey, how's it going. "*
