Two blurry colors were making zig zag motions around the city. One is yellow and the other red. The yellow one seemed to be ahead of the red one. It was Eobard Thawne and Barry Allen running against each other. The city seemed like it stood still in time compared to how fast these two were moving.
Barry was trying his best but he just can't seem to keep up. He thought he'd done everything right. He gave away everything he possessed to charity and anyone else who needed it. He had nothing except for the suit on his body. But how come he's still slower than his foe. Could it be? Thawne is somehow more destitute than him? But how? He's at zero. Could it be that Thawne owned someone money? No, Barry has already tried that. He took a loan and got himself in debt to see if he got faster before he got into this fight and he didn't. The maximum power you can get from this power scheme is when you have nothing. Debts doesn't account into it. But-
Thawne saw Barry's confusion and took the advantage and swung at Barry hard. The Flash couldn't react in time and got hit. It was a powerful punch. One of his teeth came off and Barry was thrown of course hard. He spun on the ground for several cycles and couldn't stop himself.
"Do you want to know why you're losing, Barry? You can feel it, don't you? You're getting slower." said Thawne gleefully. Barry was in pain but he can still see how smug Thawne is. He was right though. He does feel more lethargic. What's happening? Barry is at his poorest, he can't be slowing down. Did Thawne do something?
"Look at your pocket, Barry." taunted the man in yellow. Barry was confused but did what Thawne told him to do anyway. There was something in pocket. Odd. It was paper. Barry hastily tore it out of his pocket and looked at it. It was a lottery ticket. Dated today.
"It's the winning lottery, Barry" smiled Thawne. "You're rich now!"
"How-"
"It was me all along, Barry! Me!" Thawne was hysterical at this point.
