Yes! But I haven't started/didn't know there was a thing until yesterday. Also I'm working on another story inspired by the cosmonaut image prompt. Thanks for your feedback, guys. Sometimes it's hard to see if it's any good at all or not. The reinforcement helps. I hope I have the time to be in this contest. It looks like a ton of fun!
Ah, so I'm Pilgrim, and I haven't been writing avidly for very long at all. Before I went gung-ho, I dabbled. Every time I ask myself why I write, I get a different answer. Sometimes it's because I'm bored, like I was yesterday, and I write out of obligation. Sometimes, I'm feeling too much and don't know how to handle it, so I just have to get it out and down on the paper. Sometimes It's because I have something to say. Sometimes it's because I have nothing to say. Sometimes I'm not sure I care what I'm saying at all, I just like the feeling of words flowing through my fingertips. I wouldn't recommend writing out of obligation. It never seems to turn up good results. Yes, you might write every day, and yes, you might meet your word count quota or whatever, but if the writing's dry and disinterested, it usually means I have to go and live some life to write about later, like how swimmers need to breathe between strokes.
I just love WriteMonkey. It's hands down my favorite program I've ever had the pleasure to use when I'm typing prose or poetry, though the tools we use are pretty personal, and I have some weird tastes, so it wouldn't surprise me to be on the edge here. There's a few things I wish it could do, but I don't really miss em that much, and what it does do, I haven't found anywhere else. I also write in my black magic notebook. I bound it out of looseleaf binder paper, and I carry it around everywhere with me.

edit: Just realizing I double posted but not really cause I kind of said different things and I'm wondering if I should take one down or not
