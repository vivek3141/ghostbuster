This is my first one of these, so be gentle.
Everything Burns.
This is the truth that Humans as a species forgets.
Chicago, London twice before that, and Rome again before that.
Catastrophes like those rare as they are remind us that as humans we can be wiped away by nothing but the whisper of smoke in a burning build or a blaze of roaring red.
Though, we are a resilient bunch and can reduce these burning deaths to embers...however what if...we couldn't...
We should've seen the signs earlier.
An increase in house fires, then wildfires. At first they just became harder to extinguish, firefighters tried to warn people, but no one listened.
Then fires, small at first would appear to spring up on there own.
People began to notice, it was happening too quickly, it shouldn't be happening people would say. Soon there was mandatory fire fighting training for all civilians, but it was useless.
Then it was realised world round, that fire could no long be tamed, that fire would consume all, that fire burns.
Because now people know.
Everything burns.
