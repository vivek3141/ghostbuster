You slap his hands off of you and fix your roommate with your best movie-antagonist-glare. Your roommate looks shocked but recovers quickly. "What are you doing? Get up now!"
"Time is nothing more than a thing we constructed to more easily schedule our lives. Minutes, hours, days. It doesn't matter. What's your problem?" Your roommate looks at you like you've lost your mind but then sighs heavily, his shoulders sagging as a wry grin forms on his face.
"This could have been so much easier if you didn't ask questions but I guess we have no choice." Then your roommate is become demon and you fight him but he too strong so you run but he fastest. "No escape" he said in a demon voice. "Fuck you holy water bitch" and you throwered the bottle and it covered him and he died screaming "Noooo."
You is hero.
