The teenage neophyte towered over the wizened old wizard, but seemed to shrink within himself until he was but a four-year old boy caught stealing sugar cane sticks.
"Um...I think there were...like...two or three..."
"Two? Or Three? Gods above, you blithering idiot, can you not tell me whether it was two dragons you saw, or three? It's not hard!" The wizard held up two gnarled fingers in his left hand and shook them upwards at the cowering boy. Electric sparks sizzled and crackled between the fingers. "Here's two!" He held up three bony, bent fingers in his right hand, tiny luminous dust clouds popping off in micro-fireballs around them. "Here's three! Damn you, how many was it?"
"...score..."
"Shit."
