The monsters returned last night. Daddy always says not to be afraid of them, and I'm not.
I hate them.
I wish that I could fight them, but Daddy says that only Mommy can and that I might get hurt. Every time I hear them, I remember the one time that he told me not to touch the top of the stove, so I stay in my room and play with Stanley and pretend I can't hear anything. But I can hear them, and I can hear Mommy fighting them. They run from room to room, slamming doors and screaming and snarling.
And sometimes they hurt Daddy.
That makes Mommy sad, and in the morning she sits by the window and cries. And sometimes she just stays in bed because fighting them makes her so tired, and when I come home from school, Daddy says to let her be. Sometimes I sneak in to see her and she hugs me and says "I'm sorry", but I tell her that it's okay and that she's gonna beat those monsters for good because she's the best Mommy.
And she will. When Daddy put me to bed, I asked him to leave Stanley outside and he did. Let the monsters come. Stanley will stop them, and Daddy will catch them, and Mommy will kick them out forever.
