I sat down and let the chair absorb my full weight, a feeling I knew meant I was out for the count, and took out a cigarette. The air felt nice, though. Why did I have to mix whiskey and..."Alex?" The person sitting across called my name, unsure if she got it right. I smiled in assurance that she did. She sort of looks like Jessica in this light.
"Are you feeling okay?" I asked. I saw that drink change his demeanor from jumpy to ready for bed. The party just started, there were still people coming. "Yeah, thanks, I'll be okay in a minute," he laughed. He's cute.
"Hey," I nudged my friend, "think she's taken?" and jerked my eyes to the direction of the girl that was talking just talking. Joey turned his neck to me, then to her, then back to his cigarette.
"Who cares man, not like she'll care if you talk to her." "You got a point." "Joey, you got a lighter?" I patted my pockets looking for my missing lighter.
"I have it, my bad." I went over to light Alex's cigarette and handed it back to Joey. "It's chilly." I let out a pop and the permeating smell brought Andy and his friend over to the table.
Don't do it Alex. Don't take a hit. You're already fucked up, look I'm giving myself directions. Just pass it along, there you go. I looked into the house from the balcony and saw some new people coming in. "Fuck."
I opened the front door and to my happy surprise I saw Rachel. "Jessica!!" I gave her a big hug, and in a hushed tone she let me know Alex was here. I looked around and saw him looking my way.
