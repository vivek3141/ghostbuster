* Astronaut crash lands on the moon. Waking up he sees the rest of his crew either dead around him or missing. Looking at his oxygen levels he sees he has little more than 15 minutes left of life. The radio is dead *
The bitter irony. The injustice of it all! I've spent my life dreaming of coming to the moon and the second we touch down I can only dream of being home with my family. My family. I'll never see them again. Benjamin will grow up without his father. Eilidh will grow up without her husband. I owe it to myself to collect my thoughts before...before the end.
The end. The thought of being in control is unnerving to say the least, but in my current surroundings it could have been a lot worse. I knew the risks before I came. It's one thing to say you're willing to risk your life for the future of mankind but I can't remember the last time I actually feared for my life.
Why me? Why could I not have died on impact. I'm almost jealous of my dead colleagues. Almost.
I feel weird. An odd sensation that's passing through my body like a faint wind. But of course there's no wind on the moon. Perhaps it knows what's coming. Using up the last of it's resources in a vain attempt to override the part of my brain that is in touch with reality.
*Looking upwards*
The universe. So beautiful...
