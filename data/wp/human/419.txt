**Rule #1: Don't wish for world peace. It just doesn't work out, okay? **
**Rule #2: Wish for something simple, like a new IPad, or something. **
** Rule #3: If you found a random monkey paw on your way back home from work, leave it behind. **
It won't do you any good.
Monotony was something that I loathed, hated with a passion. At 7:04am, I would be in my car driving to the train station. I would catch the 7:19am into the city, and be at work around 9:00. I'd sit at my cubicle typing away at the assorment of keys (mostly the backspace button). I leave at 5:00pm, get on the train, drive back home, eat my dinner, and crash into bed. Day after day this routine happened. It never left me, it never entertained me, it never did anything but just be.
I would have agreed with anyone who said that sounds boring. I would have said that I rather be doing anything other than that.
I crossed by the monkey paw on my walk up to the train station from my car. There's this dirt path that was once paved, but my town decided it was more important to buy new speed bumps to help "save the children". Pretty sure that the children were already "saved" but now I need this damn town to fix my sanity.
It looked like a hairy hand, just peeking out from the bushes. I though it was just Buck Landon's, our town drunk. Every town has one of those, right? Maybe the community could choose to "save the drunkards". So I went to check on him, but ended up with a monkey paw. Why was a monkey paw just lying in the bushes? That probably should have been one of my wishes.
Speaking of wishes, somehow this monkey paw granted 5. Probably should have spent another wish asking how the fuck a monkey paw has magical powers. I ended up wishing for the stereotypical things. The things that would take me away from the roads of monotony. But don't be fooled, wishes don't come without consequences.
You won't be in my situation dealing with being in a hospital with incompetent fucks not being able to decide whose going to help you.
"No I insist, you have so much more skill and talent. "
"No, No, you are much more capable in communicating with the patient!"
How 'bout one of you doctors come here and fix my broken dick. Which reminds me of the last rule:
** Rule #4: Don't wish for unlimited sex. **
So if you find a monkey paw on the street, trust me, and leave it behind.
It will not do you any good.

Hmm, I kind of tapered off in the end. It was hard to keep the flow going: x. Also experimenting with less dramatic themes / trying to make a more upbeat type of story
