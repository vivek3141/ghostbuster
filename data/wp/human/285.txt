I like hard work. Makes me feel alive. So many years and I grew bored with pretty much anything. Sitting around and doing nothing, being rich while doing that, being poor, being homeless. You get bored of doing nothing. Then you start working, you get bored of that too. There's places to see and people to meet, but the first are limited and the second tend to die on you. If you're doing drugs every day for a hundred years they become mundane and boring. You get tired of sex. Want to try new things because normal ones don't excite you anymore so you try new things and keep doing that until you've run out of things to try. The most depraved acts humans can come up with don't even make you blink anymore. You've read all the books worth reading and saw all the movies worth seeing. You end up reading trashy novels and and watching porn movies for the plot. Anyway, now I'm an office man, working for this big company. I was bored and ready to quit from day one, hour one. People do this for years?
