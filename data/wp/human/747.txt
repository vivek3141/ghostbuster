Thomas" I can't do it anymore" I say to my wife in a sobbing whisper. She doesn't respond, she just sits there, on the edge of the bed...lifeless, like always. It had only been weeks since time had stopped abruptly, leaving me the only man in the world free to move about and continue life, but for what? To mourn for my wife who wasn't dead? To weep over the beds of my children as if they were their graves? What's the point? I tried everything I could, from simply moving my family myself and placing them in certain areas, to making loud noises to startle them out of their forced pause, to even giving them small shocks from a taser I stole. Nothing worked. So nothing mattered. I could care less for the rest of the world, all I have is my family, or...Had. It's been taken from me by whatever cruel being decided this should happen. No more will I spend every hour wondering why this happened, no more will I endure waking up after every nap to the solid figure of my wife sitting at the foot of our bed. My sanity has been tested, and it has been broken. I can hear my family in my dreams, its the only reason I still sleep. They call to me and in my dreams they are real, loving and alive. In my dreams time flows smooth like wind through a valley of flowers. It is there that I will stay with them. All I have left is the hope that I'll be with them forever in a dream, because I can no longer bear the reality.------------------- Thomas kisses his wife ever so slightly on her cheek, he's done the same to his children. He sits on the bed next to her, a loaded gun in his hand. As he looks into her frozen, lifeless eyes he says one last "I love you." He takes a deep breath, raises the barrel of the 44 Magnum to his temple...And pulls the trigger.
