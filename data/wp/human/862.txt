Dragons flew, the sun bled over the sky as two lovers took hand in hand while the old man wrote his recollection. Lily stood upon the bridge looking to the ethereal darkness flowing in steady streams underneath. As she sent that last heartwarming text message to her only friend, lover, Ian looked a sharp eye at the unnerving humanoid beast that twisted and turned in its deformed shape, long unnerving nails sticking from its weathers hands like blades in the shadows. all those stories, all those poems, all those unique worlds coexisting within a single mind. a single universe, a beautiful fractal that overtook his imagination. as he touched the mechanical keyboard like a sea of words his worlds unleashed themselves from his mind. his overflowing head no longer needed to store all the tales that it gave birth to. as a flowing sea of words the tales fell, almost in perfect harmony, perfect motion, to the paper. Sentence after sentence, page after page. he didn't even need to think, it just came to him, a story in a completed form forming with what seemed no effort on the screen.
the mind looked around his empty room, at the books that piled up in his shelves and he had grown up with. he looked at the screen once more.
Maybe some day his own world will sit up on that shelf as well.
