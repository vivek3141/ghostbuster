With the fervor of a infinite, metered impatience, I adjust the nexus bolt on the device ever so slightly. Sweat beads down from my temples. Anxiety wracks my insides, but I cannot afford to lose focus now. Not after so long a project.
"They called me mad," I mutter to no one. "They said it couldn't be done. They said I was crazy to even consider the creation of such a device, let alone attempt to build it! Well, science guys, who's the crazy one now?" A burble of high, manic laughter escapes my throat. "Not I! *Not. I. *"
Just one final adjustment. The screw clicks satisfyingly into place. I set down my tools, admiring my work a moment. And now it begins.
"Initialization sequence, activate." I crank down the front-facing lever with a great tug. The whirring of gears fills the room in a beautiful cacophony. "Stabilization sequence, activate." I flip up a row of switches on the side of the great machine. Each switch lights up in turn. There's an electrical hum now.
Moment of truth.
"Activation sequence, activate."
I flip the tuner from INACTIVE to ACTIVE. My breath catches in my throat. Everything seems to slow down as I watch my mechanical creation awaken.
A silvery-metal arm extends from the bowels of the device, reaching out of a sliding hatch. The arm, like a jointed snake, dips down from the machine, nearing me ever closer.
"Yes," I say as the arm advances. "Yes!"
The arm dives with excruciating, slow precision. Its single, pointed claw begins to extend...
...and it flicks the switch off.
At once, the arm retracts into the hatch. The whir of gears slows, and stops completely. The electrical hum dies to silence. The machine has successfully turned itself off.
Once this registers in my mind, my mouth splits in a fervid, gleeful grin.
"Wait until the science nerds at CERN take at a look at this!"
