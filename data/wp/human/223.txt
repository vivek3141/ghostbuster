After the longest lapse in history between books, the newest entry in the best-selling Bible series hits shelves this June. I've had a chance to get an early look at it, and I have to say, most fans are going to find the wait was completely worth it. Just like previous entries such as Leviticus, there's a never-ending slew of bloody intrigue, backstabbing, and battle scenes brought to life in vivid fashion. George R.R. Martin may regret the lengthy interlude in his own Song of Ice and Fire, as this surprise entry is likely to steal back the top spot.
We see something of a stylistic return to the Counter-Reformation here. Clearly in tune with the increasing calls for accountability, helping the poor, improved relations between adherents of different religions, and an end to the unceasing revelations of sexual misconduct by religious leaders, the author has advocated for a host of progressive changes. Of course I'm not at liberty to tell you exactly what those are, lest I spoil the surprise. But suffice to say, there's quite a few momentous alterations to church doctrine included in these thousand pages.
A couple of huge revelations resolve some confusions and correct some mistakes developed by overeager fans during the author's numerous millennium of seclusion. Such important moments as the Resurrection and Judas' betrayal are linked to modern times in mind-boggling fashion.
The translation from Latin, is, as always, divine. Its perfection justifies a purchase for language enthusiasts and polyglots on its own, as no books on the market have translations that so accurately capture the original tone in every last one of the world's languages.
If you only read one book this year, make it this one. It's a cultural milestone.
