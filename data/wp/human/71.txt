I am the daemon that all men do seek,
Due to omnipotence that I possess.
I shall bring fortune to all lives so bleak,
With three wishes think they to them I'll bless.
A man with naught did beg for avarice,
And from his rags, gold raiments I gave him.
When his convives saw, from love came malice,
And at their hands he met a death so grim.
A girl who wanted gems once found my lamp,
So round her neck a necklace I did seep,
Refulgent jewels upon a chain were clamped,
Tight'ning around her neck when she sought sleep.
But one child who wished, for *me*, love's caress,
I gave it all: eternal happiness.
