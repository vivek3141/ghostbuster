I always thought red was such a pretty colour. Even as it gushes out of me, I can't help but admire the shade. Blood pooling around my body I become aware of the smell, it's like meat at the store. At least in a store it's refrigerated, my body heat intensifies the hot iron smell. It's cold, It's dark, I want to sleep.
I'm falling backwards, the air is rushing past me and then I notice the walls. They're trying to reach out but they're all so badly decomposed. Flesh drips from their hands, organs dangle from various bones and their eyes. What's wrong with their eyes? My screams echo past me, bouncing off the walls and overlapping until it imitates the sound of torture. I will never stop falling. I will never see anything but melting corpses crying out. I have gone to hell.
