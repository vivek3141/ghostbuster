*Authors note: This is probably not what your roommate imagined, hell it wasnt even what I imagined, but the story took a slightly sci-fi direction. *
---------------------------------------------------
In the end, the abyss will always win. It is, after all, an abyss, and we are just humans. Well some of us, some of us are monsters, some of us are something in between.
"No please, I'm just trying to make a living!"
I blinked my eyes and pulled up my retinal projection. There was a 67.9% chance that the gang member was lying as some sort of ruse. His heart rate and perspiration were both elevated, but my sensors had trouble differentiating between physical and emotional stress based solely on observable characteristics.
I smiled at him, a toothy grin, that showed that I wasn't just human. My retinal implant flashed a red dot, indicating that the odds had shifted based on his posture and breathing. It was now 93.0% likely his pleas were a ruse.
"I never hurt you, I have to make some money to take care of my mother"
An image of his mother flashed into view, she was in a nursing home. The neural chip did the quick calculations and informed me that she was in a very expensive nursing home.
"Your mother costs you $2,560 per month, she can go into a state sponsored care facility at Chisholm for $504 per month."
With a mental command I approved the transfer of his mother.
"I have made the transfer, what other excuses for your behavior do you have?"
"What? You moved my mother?"
"Yes, Elaine Burkhardt, aged 93 has been approved for transfer from Ascension Acres care facility to Chisholm Institution. I have saved you over $2,000 per month."
"You can't just move my mother!" He stood up, my retinal implant flashed a yellow warning:
*aggressive posture detected, chance of anti-social behavior 98.9% *
I raised the weapon strapped to my right arm and shot him with the shock webbing. He was wrapped up and shocked into a submissive position. I mentally communicated the arrest to the pick-up team and rested into my exoskeleton, waiting for the paddy-wagon. The gang member made gurgling noises as his face pressed into the puddle leaking from the large green trash receptacle behind him. He no longer protested and I used the relative silence to review his criminal file and submit the processing paperwork. He would have an opportunity to appeal his detainment and sentencing within the next twenty-four hours, but I was not worried about him filing a successful appeal. With a mental command I froze his bank accounts, under judicial order 7331.90:
*assets gained through illegal means will be held by government until authorized revenue auditor can determine the amount, if any, of taxes not paid. The amount owed will be automatically deducted and then full account access will be returned to account holder. If sentencing includes monetary fines, taxes take precedent. If amounts owed exceed those in all of the accused accounts, account holder will have their sentence increased according to schedule X.05*
Authorized auditors took three weeks at minimum, appeals fees were due upon appeal, which could only be made within twenty-four hours of arrest, arraignment, judgment and sentencing. As I froze his accounts, I arraigned the gang member on several charges:
1. Resisting arrest
2. Assault of judicial authority
3. Destruction of public property
4. Endangerment of citizens
5. Theft of property greater than $2,500
6. Homicide
7. Vandalism of private property
The final charge prompted a new screen asking for details of the private property vandalism. I walked back to the shop window that had been broken in his flight, recorded the address, and estimated damages. The owner would have to confirm the charge, and would have tertiary rights to the gang members assets.
Judgment was a simple approval of a guilty verdict. There was no not-guilty option.
Sentencing was equally simple, I was given the option of maximum, minumum, or average. I always chose average. The average sentences of all charges were added up and added to his detainment file.
A small message light blinked blue on my wrist. I keyed in the access code and my supervisors face was superimposed over the scene in the alley.
"Good work Lyons. I watched the whole thing. I did not expect the simple license check to result in the apprehension of a dangerous criminal. That is your second level 8 apprehension this month. That made you automatically eligible for promotion from Judicial Agent Sergeant to Judicial Agent Master Sergeant. I have already approved the promotion and your additional access rights should be coming from the central office any second. Congratulations!"
The image winked out, and the alley came back into focus. I could hear the paddy wagon arrive behind me, and approved the prisoner transfer before the two Judicial Transport Officers even came into view.
"Nice catch Lyons, heard it was a good chase. What is this guy a level 6, level 7?"
I turned to the JTO, he was new, recently promoted. As I was in the process of looking up his information, a green alert blinked and instructions poured across my screen:
*You have been granted a promotion from Judicial Agent Sergeant to Judicial Agent Master Sergeant. This promotion grants the following additional rights: *
*Exemption from pre-approval of lethal action*
*Immediate access to private financial accounts*
*Enhanced behavior prediction modeling*
*Military tactical modeling*
*Enhanced exoskeleton speed and strength*
*Do you consent to the promotion (Yes/No/postpone) *
* â€˜ No'will result in immediate retirement from Judicial Corps*
*Postponement will postpone promotion for one hour, you are allowed a single postponement*
*If affirming promotion, please ensure area is secured as promotion of rights requires a 15 second reconnection period. You will not have access to primary systems during that time. *
"Excuse me, JTO?" I turned to the transfer officer who, by this time had dragged the prisoner to the paddy wagon and was walking back towards me, his slimmer exoskeleton somewhat overshadowed by my full tactical unit.
"Yes sir?"
"Can you secure the area while I am promoted? This was my second level 8 apprehension, which triggered the automatic promotion system." His eyes went wide for a second; some officers dreamt their entire lives of a level 7 apprehension, let alone a level 8, or two.
"yes sir!" he barked with a little more enthusiasm, before un-holstering his weapon and scanning the alley. A few seconds later he affirmed that the alley was secure.
*I consent to the promotion*
My retinal implant went black and my exoskeleton went into rest mode. I leaned back against the exoskeleton and closed my eyes, enjoying the silence.
*Promotion installed*
My exoskeleton returned to tactical position and I dismissed the JTO.
As I walked out of the alley, a bulletin popped up on my retinal display, it was coded for Master Sergeants and above, but addressed solely to me:
*Judicial Agent Master Sereant Lyons, new objective*
An image of a man in was superimposed across my right eye's vision.
*Name: Elias Wantanabe*
*Charges: Classified below security clearance 20*
*Objective: Locate individual*
*Additional objective: lethal action required*
I sent back an affirmative and set out to locate my target.
