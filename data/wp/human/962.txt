8:20--They should really put up walls on the platform. It'd be so easy for someone to get pushed. I've perfected my 'ready' stance, standing sideways like Bruce Lee, ready for a fight. The Metro car comes barreling by like the boulder from Indiana Jones. And I survive, to tell this story. To once again spend the day saving the world.
8:45--The lengths that people go to avoid eye contact on the train is kind of impressive actually. Being tall gives me an almost omnipotent presence. Looking down at all the shuffling feet and misplaced glances. At every stop the car filling tighter and tighter. Until eye contact is unavoidable, everybody forced to at least acknowledge the existence of those around them.
9:40--Complaining about small talk has become my small talk. Every day on the walk to my desk I mumble about the weather, co-workers kids or how my weekend was. And I feel smugly superior. Like I'm merely tolerating the existence of such drivel. And without a doubt, like clockwork, every morning I complain to the guy I share an office with about how much I hate small talk. And I realized I'm no different. He's just tolerating my nonsense. I'm a monster!
