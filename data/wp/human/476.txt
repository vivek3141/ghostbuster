The faraway girl knew the stories.
She read the untruths.
And she thought she knew what was supposed to happen.
Stared wistfully into the empty years of youth
And waited
Until one day she realized!
The princes of novels, tall, dark, handsome,
They wouldn't fall out of the sky
Knock girls on their silly heads,
Boys who get in barfights have hard mouths anyway.
The day the girl admitted the falsity in the sentences of her treasured pages,
She hardened herself to the romance-novel kisses of fairytales
(and the awkward tumbles in recirculated trucks)
She missed the perfect reality that her younger self had been promised
And she still dreamt too much
