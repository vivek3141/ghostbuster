You can find them everywhere: in old coat jackets, on gritty parking lot asphalt, bunched together between stitched-together patches of dead flesh. If someone were to hand you one, you wouldn't think twice before you took it. And why should you? It's not like you personally tore the cotton from a bug-infested field, mashed it flat, stained it a dingy green, and painted it with a perfect representation of a dead man. But you did lay our bare, uncovered, unwashed hands upon it--just like millions of people before you, and millions after you. You made an exchange, all right, and it wasn't currency.
