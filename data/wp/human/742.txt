I'd lost many friends. Too many to count. Their faces keep popping up from time to time. Mike. Ziggy. Rachel. Damn, I can't believe they got Rachel. But I had at least started something. The public was finally becoming aware. I guess we finally reached critical mass to make somthing change. It's been slow going, only allowing five of us to travel each year, on the solstice, Christ, is that anniversary coming up?
"Professor MacMillan?" I hear a voice behind me. One of my star pupils, working here over the summer.
"Yes Dev, how can I help you? ", I say smiling over my half moon glasses.
"I've heard you finally got the go ahead for starting a department of Sustainability here at Yale!". I smile at him.
"Hopefully I will be able to tie MIT in, they're not that far. The administrative part of sustainability is very important, but we need the technology to back it up." I see Dev miss a beat.
"So...Still hoping to do some collaboration with your sister?"
My sister, Sara, is working there as a bit of a sleeper. We didn't want to be too obvious pulling forth old -actually I guess here they are new- tehcnologies which could attract attention. I can't believe they've managed to track down more than half of us.
"I guess so, not sure she is interested in sustainability, but we'll see." I say. Can't trust anyone around here. Need to keep a good cover.
"Sounds brilliant! Good luck! Oh, look at the time, back to work I suppose." says Dev, backing away. I get a sinking feeling in my stomach. Damn it Dev, I thought you were one of the good ones. I suppose big oil always finds a way.
I head to the phone to give my sister a call and let her know she may be in danger. Then I reach into my locked cupboard for a gun and head down to Dev's office.
