Judy, sweetheart, listen. I understand you're upset. It's alright, I'd be upset too. Well, maybe not so melodramatic, you know I didn't fuck her because I loved her. Like, I'd understand if you were upset if I loved another woman, but let's be honest; all I did was stick my dick in her.
I mean shit, she looks just like you Judy, you're twins! It could have been a mistake! But no, you had to go off on one as per usual. Granted, it wasn't a mistake, but you could have at least asked.
Oh good you're crying. My favourite. You're such an ugly crier.
Jesus Judy, I wasn't calling you ugly, I was saying that when you cry you look ugly stop making a big deal about everything.
Why did I do it? The fuck kind of question is that? She's hot? That's a compliment by the way.
See the problem is: deep down inside, I'm still an asshole.
I'm the guy who parks over two parking spaces. I'm the guy who doesn't use his indicator.
I'm the guy who yells at retail staff for things out of their control.
I'm the guy who gives my order to the barman despite you being there first.
I'm the guy who takes the piss out of everyone but gets angry when you do it back to me.
I'm that guy.
And no matter how much you beg, plead, reason or barter with me, I'll always be that guy.
If you try and change me? Well shit Judy, you only brought it on yourself.
Deep down inside, I'm still an asshole.
And that's ok.
