"You know what I don't get?"
"What's that?"
"If these dicks all have invented or discovered time travel, why do they all seem to come to the past?"
"Because that's when history happened, Delta."
BANG
"Nice shot, Beta. I just mean that they can travel to any point in the past, present, or future, and they always seem to choose here, now, April 30th, 1945. Whoa, watch that one."
BANG
"Got him. I think it's because most people in the future learn of the things this guy did, and try to stop them from happening."
"They really don't get how time works, do they?"
BANG
"What do you mean by that?"
"Think about it, Beta. We have no idea how time travel works until it actually happens and someone has changed something."
"…I'm still not sure I follow."
"Oh for the love of…"
BANG
"Okay, Beta. Let's say I go back in time to kill this guy we're guarding as a baby. Instead of killing the baby, they just switch it with another baby. They go back to their time only to find that the baby grows up to be the guy anyway."
"With you so far, Delta."
"OR let's say I went back in time to kill my grandfather. I kill him, but I also prevent my own birth, thereby preventing me from killing my grandfather, so I never go back in time to kill my grandfather, so that all just creates an infinite loop of me killing, but not killing my grandfather."
BANG
"A little confusing, but I still follow."
"And the last way is I go back and kill both my grandparents. But nothing happens, because I just created another reality. History continues, and I can't return to my original time. I've just created an alternate timeline in the multiverse."
"Multiverse…I haven't heard that term before."
"That's because the multiverse theory doesn't appear until 1957."
"How do you know…wait, why're you pointing your gun at…"
"Sorry, Beta."
BANG
…

…
"April 30th, 1945. I didn't think I'd be the one to finally make it here. I guess it's time for us to find out how time travel works, Mr. Hitler."
