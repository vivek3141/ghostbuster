A man finds a magic lamp in the middle of the desert.
**rub rub rub rub** *
*the genie springs from the lamp! *
"Request to me your wishes three, and I shall grant them onto thee!"
The man who held the genie lamp put his finger to his head to think.
"Hmmm... I wish to have all of the gold in Greece!"
The genie whirled his finger.
"Hocus pocus Gods of old, shower this man with Greece's gold!"
The man gleefully awaited his riches, but nothing happened.
"You have not granted my wish, genie!"
"Your wish granted I have done, the gold in Greece there is none.
Greece rose and fell from history upon the year 146 BC."
The man was astonished. He pulled out his calendar. **147 BC**
"Two more wishes are now yours, think now carefully I implore."
The man angrily commanded the genie.
"I wish to have a royal carriage that can take me anywhere in the world!"
The genie whirled his finger.
"By my magic genie tail, your wish granted I unveil!"
**a carriage appears next to the man**
The man jumps for joy into the carriage. Eager to be gone from the desert, he grabs the reins and--
"... Genie, where is my horse for my royal carriage??"
"A wish for a carriage is what you did, neigh did you wish a horse included."
The man stomped in fury and anger. He came down from his carriage.
"You have failed to grant my wishes genie! My final wish is for you to free me from this desert so I may never have to look upon you or this wasteland again!"
The genie whirled his finger.
"Hullaballoo howdy do, free from this desert will now be you."
**The man poofed away**
*elsewhere, in Greece*
"Ahh, the ruins of Greece. At least I am free from that barren desert."
The man set out on his way, but was stopped by a troop of Romans.
"Where do you think you're going?" Said troop #1.
"Please, I do not wish for any trouble" the man said, falling to his knees.
"Troubles what you got" Said troop #2.
"Let me free please, it is all that I wish!"
"Well we have 3 wishes ourselves" said troop #3.
"I haven't seen my wife in months. While you're down there, fulfill our wishes and we shall fulfill yours!"
