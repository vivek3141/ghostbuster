{I'm taking artistic license with this one}
The tension in the room was thick. Jughead sat at the old kitchen table, looking at his long-time best friend sitting opposite. He rubbed a hand over his smooth head. He'd lost the crown years ago, and male pattern balding had set in with a vengeance.
Archie sat, a downtrodden look on his face. The years had not been kind, though there was a hint of the impish boy he had been showing through on his face, despite the extra pounds about his middle and the jowls giving him an odd triple chin.
Jughead cracked another beer and finally spoke after a long silence. "So she's leaving you then?"
Archie nodded, a single tear rolling from his now watery blue eye. "I never thought it would end up like this. Not in a million years."
"I hear ya, bud." Jughead frowned as he remembered to pass the bottle to Arch. "Life's funny, ain't it? I never would've guessed I'd wind up with Cheryl after Ethyl passed. I still miss her, sometimes. Ethyl wasn't much to look at, but she loved me like no other. Cheryl is still a real looker though, and man, she is just a tamale in the...But you don't want to hear about that." Jughead cleared his throat, looking away in embarrassment.
Archie took a sip of his beer, and frowned. "No, it's all right. I need to know there's some hope for me to find someone now that I'm alone again."
Jughead nodded thoughtfully. "Hey! Have you talked to Betty yet? She carried a powerful torch for a long time, even after you married Ronnie."
Jughead watched Archie, puzzled when he didn't respond. Was his face looking a little green? "You okay bud?"
"Jug...You know how I just got done telling you Ronnie left me for someone else?"
Jughead nodded. "Yeah, so?"
"She left me for Betty. They're calling themselves "life partners" now."
Jughead downed his own beer.
"Well shit."
Archie gazed out the window.
"You ever feel like killing yourself Jug?"
