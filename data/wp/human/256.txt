I wiped the blood from my cleaver, a crimson pool forming as my rag pushed the substance down the blade. "Such a beautiful thing..." I mused to myself as I set the steak on the pan.

"Allison, I need twenty two more this week." said the figure in the shadows. I pretend she's a she and her name is Zephyr; it's so freeing compared to the shadows she cloaks herself in.
"I suppose that's doable...I presume you'll handle the paperwork?" I respond as I take a sip of my drink; a cold amber ale fresh from the taps.
"Of course. Don't I always?" she responded before slipping out of the booth and slinking towards the back hallway. She always did have such a lovely gate. Oh, if only...

Alexis is such a delight. I met her on Monday and she has the very best schedule! A truly gifted life;
* 0800 she wakes to the gentle chorus of lyrebirds saying beautiful things
* 0810 she walks down her mahogany floored hallway to her private shower
* 0840 she towels off...
* 0850 is breakfast, prepared not by a machine, but a personal chef
* 0945 she dresses for work
* 1100 she heads to work, her chauffeur navigating her helicopter through the busy air ways.
* 1700 the office work ends and her chauffeur whisks her to the Zoroastrian Temple on 1E5D7C Ave
* 1900 with her chosen deities attended to, she heads for dinner, the chauffeur at the wheel once more.
* 2200 dinner finished, her stomach and mind at ease through meal and wine she sends for the chauffeur and heads home to begin it all once more.
I do love watching Alexis, her routines are my routines. My retinal clock flashes:
**17:00**
**17:00**
**17:00**
"Work...how I detest when you interrupt my subtle games" I mutter to myself as Alexis walks into the Temple.
She sets down her bag and walks to the altar of fire just as she always does. Her scarf unravels as she takes off her jacket and sets it aside.
The beauty of churches...so many rituals to follow. I release my grip and fall from the rafters, my stiletto plunging nicely into the soft of the back of her skull. She slumps: dead in an instant. The chauffeur screams and I idly wonder if they were lovers as I pull a small silenced pistol from my chest harness and put him down.

"Two? Already?"
"Yes, you'll have the location as soon as you make the transaction." I reply
"Or I could wait...and let you hang for your crimes."
Zephyr can be such an asshole sometimes.
"No no, you wouldn't do such a thing. You like me FAR too much for that."
"Check your accounts. Goodbye." and the line goes dead.
I watch from the alcove of a nearby building as a small army of bots arrives outside the temple. Like so many ants they collect and clean. Scurrying too and fro in an effort to make things right.

"Your first delivery last week was quite difficult. Were you showing off?" asked Zephyr as she twirled a pen on the table. Her pen is oh so like my stiletto, though it draws ink instead of blood; they're both guilty of so many things.
"Show off? Of course not, who would I be showing off to?" I say with a coy smile as I run my boot down her shin.
