I swirl the liquid in my glass and quickly pour it down my throat. The familiar warmth fills my soul, replacing the horror of watching my beloved wife die in my arms; watching her beautiful aura fade away into nothingness. She's always telling me to slow down my drinking. I don't listen. This time, she paid the ultimate price. I shouldn't have driven.
Today isn't that different from any other day - I'm almost to the bottom of the bottle, but the pills are kicking in. Soon, I'll be asleep. Soon, I'll be with her again. I'm sorry, my love.
