The door closed with a sharp sound as if a banshee was screaming her heart out. Pushing the cold air onto his face.Silence was left in the room with only him and his broken heart. The not so familiar salty taste entered his mouth as he caught himself off guard from the tears from
his dark eyes.
"It Sucks but we both know that this is for the best "the words repeated themselves in his mind while slowly walking to the kitchen, every step he took was as heavy as if his very beings had lost the power to exist in this reality however nonetheless he still made his way to the kitchen and started heating up the teapot. As he stood their he could see the days and years pass by like a movie. Their times spent together, everything they had done together from the food they cooked and enjoyed together to the fights.
He was hopeless, after all this time. It all just ended like that.
