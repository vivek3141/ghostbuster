Many years ago, Dreadlord Nefarius had managed to reach the end of his eternal pursuit and gained absolute power...then figured out he didn't know what to do with it. Some even found him a better ruler than the one with rights to that power.
For the longest time, I've had suspicions about my neighbour. The way he reminisces about the days of Nefarius, the way he seems to crave power, the way he sometimes seems to be someone else entirely...he seems like a nice guy, but it's a classic trope that the villian is a nice guy once you get past the whole "taking over the world" thing.
I so desperately want to know what his true story is, but I can't exactly ask "excuse me, are you secretly Dreadlord Nefarius?"
But one of my friends was a Blood Knight of the Eternal Flameland. I say "was" because once he got used to less, um, deadly pastimes, he became just like another one of us.
I have reason to believe that even the worst person can change. That everyone can be a good person, no matter how dark their past.
I'm guessing my neighbour does too.
The villain really is a good person once they get over the whole "taking over the world" thing.
