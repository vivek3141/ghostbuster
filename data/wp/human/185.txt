I sat in the small, uncomfortable plane. The erratic beating of my heart was no less peaceful than the turbulent winds outside. Desperate times called for desperate measures.
The modern weapons of war were tactical and humanitarian in nature. A half-century old rifle was brutally effective, clunky and inhumane. All militaries were required to keep their firearms current to within ten years to avoid unnecessary suffering. Modern guns, bombs and planes, like the one I was in had their advantages not in power but in range, reliability and stealth.
The soft blinking of the light told me to prepare. That was a farce; I didn't need to prepare. There wasn't a parachute to drop me. That would just make me easier to hit on the way down. The only other man noticed it as well and with a face no less grim than my own began popping open the airtight box. Very carefully, with both hands, he gave me a simple piece of wood with a rock tied to the end.
"You're going to bomb them back to the stone age, Soldier."
All I had to do was hit the ground.
