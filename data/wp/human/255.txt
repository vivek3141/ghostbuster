I thought this was a fantastic read. I really enjoyed how you intertwined the beginning of the story with Markus and snippets of the interview. I really enjoyed the pacing of the story. If anything, I agree with other people that this would have benefited from being longer. A lot of people have mentioned that they would have liked to see the mystery expanded upon, but I think expanding on the ending would be nice. I was surprised how quickly Markus sent a report back at the end - it didn't seem like a complete report.
But really, though, I found this to be a gripping tale and loved every moment of this story. I simply wanted to read more! Good luck!
