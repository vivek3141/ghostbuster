The Sky and the Earth looked at each other, longing and yet separated for eternity.
The sky looked down at the beautiful earth. He whispered to her and his breath washed over her face and created waves in her seas, "Why can't we get closer? Why can't we join? This eternal distance. This love. This want. This thirst."
The earth replied to the handsome sky, "Suppose we say we become one, my darling. Suppose we touch, suppose we join, then we shall be one, not two.
We shall join, you shall complete me and I you. We shall no longer be two, we shall be one, in perfection. And then what?
The thirst will quench. The bliss shall be tasted. But there would be no want. No love. No thirst, anymore."
And thus the Sky and Earth looked at each other with longing and remained untouched for eternity, keeping the thirst alive.
