/u/Luna_LoveWell has ruined this for me, but here goes...
The hour is 1630. The evening is Freya's day. My colleagues are removing their ties and leaving early, slovenly sauntering to the bar over the road. But there remains reconciliation to be done. This is time for /u/Veganpuncher.
The VP gazes, condescendingly, out of the 32nd floor window at the hordes of ingrates who will not finish their TP16's tonight. He turns to his computer and roars "To defeat my enemies, to drive them before me, and to hear the lamentations of their women." And it's on.
Form after form is torn from inboxes, processed, signed, and processed. By the time Freya has crossed the moon, VP has emptied the room of paper. It is time for ale.
VP, retaining the dignity that the nonbelievers associate with ties, ascends to their 'bar'. He gazes upon their light beers and white wines, snorts, and orders the biggest beer in the house. Without a thought it is consumed. Another follows.
One's own sons await the fruits of Accounts Receivable at home, bitter and unblooded from a week at school, but Debbie, from AI has mentioned that her boyfriend has left for the weekend. It is time for VP to live up to his beard. Wiping the froth from his beard, VP walks up to the table at which Debbie sits.
'Anyone sitting here better have a bigger axe than VP!'
The crowd roars. The axe is produced and the song begins: 'My cock rages on, my cock rages on...'
