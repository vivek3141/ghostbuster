& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Ardinius the Magnificent plucked at his silken robes, and fixed a neutral expression on his face. *Why did it have to be an arrowhead? * He thought, as he watched the elvish instructor demonstrate the spell he needed to learn for his quest.
& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; **Because he is the only one who knew the spell. Stop acting like a racist bigot and learn. **
& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; *Shut. Up. * He told the voice in his head.
& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" Sirrah, you seem distracted," said the Elvish spellmaster.
& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Ardinius gritted his teeth, and in a tightly controlled tone, he said. "I am fine, arr-" He cut himself off, then continued, "Spellmaster." *If I didn't need this spell I'd never let this bloody arrowhead talk down to me. *
& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; **He *is* your superior. **
& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; *I thought I told you to shut up! *
& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; **I cannot be silenced. **
& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; *I'll kill the man who cursed me with you and took my father and then you will be gone, * Ardinius shouted in the recesses of his mind.
& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; The elvish spellmaster watched the apprentice sorcerer for few moments, as his expression kept changing with his mental discussion. Ardinius might have thought his expression inscrutable, but elves were past masters of the art of reading facial expressions. "If you won't pay attention, I will leave you to your own devices and allow you to suffer
from your folly."
& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" You'll do no such thing you bloody arrowhead!" He shouted aloud. He regretted it instantly as a coin back flew into his face and broke his nose.
& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" We are done," said the spellmaster, coldly. "I will not tolerate an ignorant, rich, little brat with an inflated notion of his self-worth, no matter how much gold he spends, or who sent him on his quest."
& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" I'll double your fee!"
& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" We are done," the elf repeated. "Begone." The spellmaster raised his hand and the insolent whelp in resplendent robes was surrounded by magical energy and sent flying out of the spellmaster's tower.
& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Ardinius the Sore landed roughly, and immediately got to his feet and began charging heedlessly back to the tower, only to bounce off an invisible wall, barring him entry.
& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; **Moron. **
& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; *Shut up. *
