The sound came first, that's what I most remember about that strange day. A sort of scrapping sound, which heralded the arrival of a strange blue box. Then He burst out, looking ready to hike through the tundras that used to cover this part of the planet. I don't know whether He was a time traveler, but the confused look on His face told us that He was not expecting to be greeted by a crowd of armed men in a wood at night. At that point, none of us knew that He would be our savior. He simply turned and called into His machine, "Rose, time for another adventure."
And the rest is history...
