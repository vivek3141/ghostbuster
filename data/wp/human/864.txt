[translated]
It was the mystery of the century.
Voyagers, looking for Spice, landed on the moon of a third planet from the star Proxell. What they found, no one could believe.
Found on the surface was a white banner attached to the end of a fairly preserved metallic rod. Scientists have dated the material to be only approximately one thousand Creaxellion years old. Closer inspection of the banner leads some to believe that dyes were imbedded within the fabric, perhaps with the intention of inscribing a message on the banner.
Additionally, small imprints on the lunar surface were also found; however, these prints did not match any life form found on Creaxellion. Aluminum pieces were found scattered within the flag's viscidity, but scientists have yet to make anything of this.
All of this was big news, considering there were no other signs of life in the entire solar system or any nearby systems...
An examination of the host planet could suggest that a primitive civilization might have inhabited the planet and developed sufficiently enough to reach their satellite moon. However, there is a lack of evidence to support this claim. Other scientists suggest that the host planet, due to its lack of water and its high levels of radiation, could never support intelligent life. Whatever the case, the search for the truth continues, and our citizens continue to ponder our seemingly unbridgeable aloneness in the vast ocean of space and time.
