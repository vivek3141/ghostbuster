"This is seriously how you decide who gets omnipotent power? Like this isn't some shitty joke you play on mortals for kicks?" I asked the man in the white robe in front of me. He had just finished up the Bruce Almighty routine before I could even ask about his authenticity.
"Yes, there's simply no way around it I'm afraid, my child." He replied, His words, while quiet, were confident and soothing.
"So you just pulled two random people from the globe to compete for their newly granted powers? This competition is ridiculous! You look so stereotypical and this is the random type of bullshit you come up with? You've got the robe, the beard, the staff, the sandals, fucking sandals..." I broke off incredulously.
"Your opponent has already agreed to the terms and rules of this challenge. Son, I made you for this, accept this challenge and compete to replace me as God. Accept this and accept your destiny." He Spoke to me, his words coming out as a whisper yet hitting me harder than bricks.
My palms clammy, and stomach heavy I looked up to meet his eyes. They met mine, holding care and hopeful longing. "I accept" I replied, as excitement and relief swept over his features.
"Amazing" he said clapping his hands together ", as of now the competition has started, first person who shits will lose. I wish you the best of luck." He said before disappearing.
