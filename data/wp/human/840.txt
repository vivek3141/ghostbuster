The piano's keys hammered out a melody,
an enigmatic, haunting dirge, a eulogy without words
my fingers wrote, the air, their pages.
The ash from my cigarette graces my pants with a visit,
"what harm is smoking when you never die?" And I,
I've never died, though I've tried.
All the king's horses and all the king's men,
couldn't tear me asunder, couldn't snuff out my flame.
My tune draws to a close,
I stand, to a standing ovation from a single uninvited guest.
I turn, and nearly die from shock. Ha!
Death stands watching amidst the empty tables, the barren chairs,
He'd always indulged in dramatic flair.
Tal and spindly, in pinstripe suit, hair impeccable, well groomed,
my heart reached to him, and my feet followed suit.
We embraced amidst the haze and heat,
The glow of flames, choking smoke,
"What harm is smoking when you can't die?"
I had to try.
The building ablaze, Death claimed me at last.
