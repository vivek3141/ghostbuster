-So, Mr G. what compelled you on this search for the extension of life? What did you see while you were unconscious that changed so much your outlook on life?
Mr G <Staring at me with the look you get from someone who`s seen more than their share fair of things you don't talk over dinner things, or maybe that sociopath on TV and maybe some creepy looking person in the subway? That doesn't come close to what I saw when I looked at the eyes of the man in question. It didn't have depth, because depth asks for a dimension, and that stare didn't have any. Apart from that Mr G. seemed as harmless as any other kind old man you sometimes secretly wish was you grandpa">
-Son, what really shocked me was not what I had seen, but exactly the opposite: what I hadn't seen. Or might have seen. The thing is, I what I saw was the lack of what I expected and believed my whole life, and that was what scared me the most.
<i was prepared for this, and they wouldn't had chosen me if they weren't sure I was. I fumbled thought my papers in search for the right question, subfolders: Transcendence and Nothingness. So I, already loaded with questions and the sureness that I knew the answers, for that was also part the job of a journalist of my ability>
So Mr G, what exactly about this nothingness shocked you? Can you try to explain it?
-Hmm, Mr. Journalist, I do not think I made my point quite clear. When I said I said the lack of something it was the lack of memory, because after all our existences are based on memory, remembering and knowing. What I saw was the lack of memory. The only way I can explain it to you is as if it was infinitum, for it doesn't have a start or end like we organic beings, and also unlike us it just is.
