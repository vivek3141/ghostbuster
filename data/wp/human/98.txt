Somehow I ended up playing the detective. The mission commander didn't want anything to do with the investigation but said someone had to figure out how Jones died. I was reluctant, even after everyone voted it should be me. I guess I was the only logical choice, having spent part of my career working for the FBI crime lab.
We knew it was murder. You don't remove your own helmet in atmosphere like that. Especially not since the helmet requires a latch to be flipped on the back, past where you can reach with the suit's limited mobility. So how do I find out who did it? After checking all the station's cameras, it's obvious there was someone with Jones when he went through the airlock. That's not good.
I decided to begin questioning. I talked to the whole crew. I couldn't pin a motive on anyone. Jones and Martin were known lovers. Martin had an air-tight alibi as she had been in the lab, and was recorded there on camera. She was so beautiful and perfect. Jones had been a lucky guy.
Watching the video of him suffocating to death had been tough. It was harder than seeing it in person.
