Holy shit trains,
Trains for days,
My Scale Electric,
Rail way.
It had tunnels and turns,
And signals and sound.
I'd watch as they travelled,
Around and around.
They never went far,
My bedroom was small,
But my imagination
Made up for it all.
"Here it comes again!"
I'd scream in delight,
Playing for hours,
From morning till night.
-
But then came a time,
When I couldn't play...
I must've been bad,
Cause dad took them away,
I said I was sorry,
I asked what to do,
But then Daddy left,
And he took the car too.
Mum got a lawyer,
Dad married again,
But I was left lonely,
Without my toy train.
