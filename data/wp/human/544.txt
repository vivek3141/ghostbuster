I can see the ambulance. Blue and red lights color the road signaling my doom. What could be about to happen? I'm going at barely 18 miles per hour. Suddenly I see another ambulance behind it. And another. And another. I'm really scared. I see a fire in the distance. I speed up, I need to get away from what ever is about to happen.
The reports say the 31 year old man was trying to exit the town when he crashed with an ambulance responding to the fire. When he crashed, the abulance responding to the crash crashed, and so did the one behind it. So far 178 ambulances have crashed and the numbers are going up. This glitch in the system may mean the end of the vision program.
