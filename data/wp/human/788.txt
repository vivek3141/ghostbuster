Eulaliaaaa! Death's on the wind! Eulaliaaaa!
What's that you don't know the war cry of the Hares of Salamandastron from the late Brian Jacques Redwall novels. How could a wholesome book series like this not be your favorite?
Rats of Nimh was also pretty good while we're talking about intelligent rodents. I would, however, not suggest Watership Down for children despite the talking animals.
I'm male.
My writing motivation is my friends, this community, and just loving the grind.
