"Mommy, I'm scared." The little girl stood at the top of the stairs, holding her blankie.
"It's okay, baby. Just go back to your room. I'll be up in a minute." I watched her turn around and go back before I resumed boarding up the front door. They were everywhere now. It was everyone for themselves and I had to protect my daughter. Why didn't people listen when the ignorant garbage conservative media spewed their hate-speak? Now they're in their reinforced bunkers and we're left in the cold, trying to survive through the earthquakes and hurricanes. They warned us this would happen.
Oh god. They're here. I see a pair of them walking up the sidewalk, hand in hand. I have to hammer faster. I hit my thumb. It cracks open and bleeds. It doesn't matter. I have to protect this house. They're coming up the driveway. Leave. LEAVE. They stopped to look at the rosebush I have out front. I ready another board. They judge my color-scheme. I nail it to the doorframe. The door opens. I throw myself back onto the staircase. A single arm reaches through the gap in the boards.
"Heyyyyy!"
I scream and run upstairs. Why didn't we listen? What do we do now?
