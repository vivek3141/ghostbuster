In a world where technological advancements blurred the line between intimacy and connectivity, I discovered an unexpected burden. Whenever someone indulged in self-pleasure while fixated on an image of me, a rather insidious notification invaded my phone screen. At first, shock overwhelmed me, but soon a profound sense of invasion tinged each message. Unable to escape the barrage, I became a prisoner of my own desirability. Friends turned into suspects, acquaintances into voyeurs. The longing for privacy deepened, eclipsing my very essence. In this interconnected realm, I yearned to regain control over what was mine, defenseless against the penetrating virtual gaze.
