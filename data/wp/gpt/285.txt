I've always been an ordinary, or at least I used to be. For over a thousand years, I have witnessed the rise and fall of empires, the birth of new ideologies, and the evolution of humankind. Immortality bestowed upon me in the year 1014 AD, when I made a pact with an ancient deity. Little did I know that the price of endless life would be a permanent separation from my loved ones, destined to roam the Earth as a solitary being.
Now, here I am, in the bustling world of corporate America. A simple desk job, like any other mortal. Looking back on my millennium in existence, I can't help but feel a profound sense of emptiness. I have seen dreams shattered, hopes diminished, and humanity at its best and worst.
A part of me yearns for connection, for the bliss of human touch. But as the world around me races forward, I find it difficult to relate to the trivialities of everyday life. The endless pursuit of wealth and power seems so inconsequential in the grand scheme of things.
But amidst the monotony and routine, I have come to appreciate the little things. The warmth of a sunrise, the laughter of a child, the serenity of a starry night; these moments remind me of the beauty that still surrounds us. They remind me that even though I have outlived everyone I knew, I am still a part of this world.
So, as the hours tick by and I sit at my desk, I summon the strength to keep going. Despite the pains of immortality, I am determined to find purpose in the transient existence of corporate America, knowing that even the ordinary can hold extraordinary experiences.
