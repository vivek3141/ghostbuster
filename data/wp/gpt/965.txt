In the small town of Edenbrook, peace reigned. It was a place where everyone lived harmoniously, bound by one intriguing rule. From birth, each person was issued a unique license granting them the right to kill a single person without any legal consequences.
This regulation, known as The Morality Act, was established centuries ago as a means to deter crime and empower individuals to take responsibility for justice. Understanding the weight of such a choice, citizens rarely exercised their license.
One day, tragedy struck Edenbrook. The town was shaken when a renowned doctor, Dr. Eleanor Grant, was found brutally murdered. The community mourned as they were once again reminded of the fragility of life. Determined to uphold their values, the inhabitants united to seek justice.
As hours turned into days and days into weeks, whispers began to circulate that the killer had made a fatal mistake—they had used their coveted license. Justice was inevitable. The townsfolk banded together to unravel the truth, supporting the police investigation every step of the way.
Seemingly ordinary people became relentless detectives. And through their collective efforts, they uncovered a web of deceit, betrayal, and revenge that had consumed Dr. Grant's life.
With evidence in hand, the murderer was apprehended, facing trial according to the Morality Act. As the verdict was read, the people of Edenbrook realized that their commitment to righteousness was unwavering. They had trusted the system, worked together, and found solace in maintaining justice—albeit with one life sacrificed.
And so, Edenbrook continued to flourish, a testament to a society bound by the knowledge that the power to kill was akin to the burden of choosing one's own fate.
