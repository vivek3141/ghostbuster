In the ethereal realm of the afterlife, chaos was brewing. Heaven and Hell, two formidable yet opposing powers, had found themselves overwhelmed by an unforeseen complication. Teleportation, a phenomenon embraced by humanity, had created a colossal problem for the realms beyond.
With every teleport, a mortal's body would be tragically annihilated, only to be instantaneously recreated at the destination. The untold billions of duplicated souls created each year began to overflow both Heaven and Hell, stretching their resources and systems to their breaking points.
Acknowledging the gravity of the situation, the divine leaders of both realms, Gabriel and Lucifer, called for an emergency meeting. Bipartisan in nature, this gathering aimed to address the growing issue and find a mutually advantageous solution.
Representatives from Heaven and Hell descended upon a neutral ground, a celestial oasis floating amidst the stars. They arrived with a shared understanding of the urgency and the dire consequences that awaited if the situation remained unaddressed.
As the meeting commenced, a collective determination to find a solution sprouted within the divine assembly. Gabriel, with his compassionate eyes, beseeched his counterparts, "We cannot continue on this trajectory. Our realms cannot sustain the influx of freshly duplicated souls indefinitely."
Lucifer, known for his cunning nature, nodded. "I agree, Gabriel. The perpetual recreation of souls has disrupted the order of the underworld. Our resources are strained, and chaos threatens to consume Hell."
A silence fell as they contemplated the magnitude of the challenge before them. After a moment, a voice emerged from the corner of the meeting room – a being known as Azrael, the Angel of Death. With a somber expression, Azrael imparted a suggestion that left all in awe.
"Might I propose a solution that would benefit both realms?" Azrael's voice rang with certainty. "What if we were to implement a system that prevents the duplication of souls during teleportation? Instead, we could redirect these souls to a realm specifically designed for their integration."
Intrigued, all eyes turned toward Azrael, the purveyor of death. Gabriel took a step forward, curiosity glimmering in his eyes. "A separate realm? But how would it function? What purpose would it serve?"
Azrael's features crinkled into a wise smile. "It would be a realm devoted to reincarnation. Souls arriving there would shed their memories of past lives, reborn into new bodies, and commence their journey anew. This would allow our realms to maintain their balance while granting mortals an opportunity for growth and redemption."
The proposition was met with unanimous approval. A sense of relief washed over the divine gathering as they realized that an agreement was reachable. The collective power of Heaven and Hell would forge this new realm, where souls could replenish their mortality and endure the cycle of rebirth.
The celestial architects worked tirelessly, constructing the new realm that would soon become known as Purgatoria. It would be a place where souls, stripped of their memories, would embark on the grand adventure of life once more—free from the burdens of Heaven or the sufferings of Hell.
As Purgatoria began to weave its existence, the infinite cycles of birth, death, and rebirth restored balance to Heaven and Hell. No longer burdened by the onslaught of duplicated souls, the divine realms flourished once more.
And so, the bipartisan emergency meeting had set in motion a solution that harmonized the celestial spheres. Purgatoria became a realm of salvation—a testament to the resilience and ingenuity of Heaven and Hell, and the intricate balance they held in the grand tapestry of existence.
