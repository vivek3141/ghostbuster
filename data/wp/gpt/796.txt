Modor the Destructor, feared across realms, found himself powerless against a tiny, inquisitive force that laughed and tinkered. A 2-year-old boy named Oliver held the key to his strength. Modor watched, bewildered, as Oliver's chubby fingers unlocked powers unimaginable. Toys levitated, objects morphed into extraordinary shapes, and laughter echoed through the air. Yet, Modor's once sinister purpose felt hollow. His reign of terror seemed insignificant compared to Oliver's innocent curiosity. As the boy's laughter filled his ears, Modor realized the true cost of his power. And so, the Destructor made a choice that day â€“ to protect that laughter at all costs.
