Sunlight peeking through leaves,
Whispers of laughter on the breeze.
Barefoot adventures in endless fields,
Where magic and dreams were concealed.
A rusty swing in an old oak tree,
High in the sky, how fearless were we.
Imagination soared, on wings we flew,
Through realms unknown and skies so blue.
Picnics by the river, under golden rays,
Barely noticing the passing days.
Laughter and games, oh, how we'd play,
Time, an abstract concept, far away.
Childhood memories, like treasures to keep,
A poem in my heart, etched so deep.
For though we're grown, these moments live on,
Reminding us of a time long gone.
