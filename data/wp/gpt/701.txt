As I sat at the corner table, sipping my coffee, a peculiar waiter caught my eye. There was something about his thick moustache and the way he carried himself that seemed oddly familiar. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but it triggered a distant memory deep within me.
As I discreetly observed him serving other customers, an unsettling thought crept into my mind. Could he possibly be Adolf Hitler? I mean, it was highly unlikely, considering the führer was long deceased, but my imagination ran wild.
Determined to dispel my irrational fears, I decided to strike up a conversation. "Excuse me, sir, have we met before?" I asked, attempting to hide my suspicion.
He chuckled softly, his eyes twinkling with a kind warmth. "I don't believe so, my friend. But I've been here for years, serving coffee to customers like yourself."
Relieved yet still intrigued, I continued to probe cautiously. "You remind me of someone, someone from history."
The waiter's smile widened. "Ah, you're not the first one to make that observation. But rest assured, I am simply a humble server, not a former dictator."
I felt a wave of relief wash over me. It seemed utterly implausible that Adolf Hitler would be my waiter. His jovial nature and genuine kindness were in stark contrast to the infamous dictator's character.
Leaving the café, I couldn't help but chuckle at my wild imagination. It was clear that my attempt to connect dots that didn't exist had been nothing more than an amusing distraction. As I walked away, I was 90% certain that my waiter was just an ordinary man, and the ghost of Hitler had yet to resurface.
