Once upon a time, in a land where waters ran crystal clear, there lived a small village named MarContest. Nestled between mountains and valleys, it thrived on its people's bond with nature. However, a dreadful drought struck, leaving the villagers in despair. Their songs of joy became whispers of agony. Desperate for a solution, young Eira embarked on a perilous journey upstream, guided only by a flickering hope. Through treacherous terrains, she discovered a magical spring hidden beneath the forest's heart. Drawing strength from nature, she channeled the water to her village, restoring life to MarContest. From that day on, they cherished water as their greatest gift.
