In the dimly lit basement office of an unremarkable building hidden deep within the heart of the bustling city, a man sat behind a cluttered desk. His name was Edwin Powers, and he was the mastermind behind a peculiar business enterprise. His claim to fame? Supplying aspiring super villains with an endless variety of goons.
Edwin's shelves were filled with files, each containing information on potential recruits. They ranged from masked men with bad aim to hideous and even seductive merfolk – all ready to serve the sinister whims of the world's most malevolent minds. This secret enterprise was known only to a select few villains who sought their minions through Edwin's discrete service.
His life changed the day he encountered a fallen villain named Simon Vex. Simon had once been a formidable adversary, but his attempts to create his own army of loyal followers crumbled due to unreliable suppliers. That's when Edwin stepped in, offering assistance in recruiting and vetting the right kind of talent. Impressed by Edwin's methods and success, Simon shed his villainous ways and became Edwin's right-hand man.
From that day forward, Edwin's reputation grew. Super villains from all corners of the world knocked on his door, seeking henchmen to populate their schemes. One particular client, the notorious Doctor Malevolent, had a penchant for underwater lairs and needed guards suited to the task.
Rumors of the Doctor's sinister plans spread like wildfire, and Edwin knew he needed something extraordinary to meet his demands. Through extensive research, he discovered a hidden cove filled with a tribe of captivating yet ruthless merfolk. In a dark corner of his office, Edwin kept files on dangerous figures – each carefully identified and categorized. Within one of these files lay the secret coordinates of the merfolk's underwater kingdom.
Donning a suit, Edwin embarked on a treacherous journey to meet the merfolk. With a mixture of charm and cunning, he forged an alliance, promising to supply the tribe with needed resources in exchange for their services in guarding the Doctor's lair. The merfolk agreed, seeing the opportunity to acquire human treasures and inflict chaos on their unsuspecting enemies.
Back in his office, Edwin watched the Doctor's sinister smile grow wider as he introduced the merfolk into his ranks. These aquatic enforcers, with their shimmering tails and glistening skin, brought an unmistakable beauty to the Doctor's wicked empire.
But Edwin's job did not end with the merfolk. Super villains from all walks of life approached him with requests for henchmen of various capabilities. Some needed brawn to enforce their will upon others, while others sought cunning thieves to execute stealthy heists. Edwin's success allowed him to employ a network of recruiters and trainers to find and prepare the perfect goons for any task thrown their way.
As Edwin's clientele expanded, so did his ambitions. No longer content with mere goons, he began to recruit and train skilled operatives who could match the superhuman abilities of heroes. In a world where heroes arose to counter the villains, there was always an arms race. For every punch thrown by a hero, a super villain countered with a weapon forged by Edwin's hand.
Edwin's enterprise thrived for years, until one day, destiny intervened. In an unforeseen turn of events, a group of heroes uncovered his secret operation, leaving no stone unturned. The heroes quickly deduced that Edwin was the key to dismantling the entire network of evil.
Cornered, Edwin knew that his days were numbered. But his dedication to the super villain cause was unwavering. With an eerie smile, he accepted his fate, knowing that the seeds he had sown would bear dark fruits for years to come.
As the heroes closed in, Edwin packed up his office, leaving faint traces of his presence. Upon his departure, a pristine business card appeared on the desk in place of his cluttered files. It read: “E. Powers – Quality Recruitment. When Evil Calls.” And like that, Edwin vanished into the annals of legend.
To this day, super villains continue to find their goons through Edwin's legendary business. His legacy lives on, ensuring that, in a world of heroes and villains, the forces of darkness will always have access to a legion of followers – thanks to a mysterious man who specialized in supplying grunts of a wide variety.
