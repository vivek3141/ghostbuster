In the heart of the Commonwealth, amidst the ruins of a forgotten world, it was Christmas time. Around flickering fires, parents gathered their wide-eyed children, reminiscing about the post-war tale of old Saint Nick. They spoke of a time when gifts weren't scarce, when laughter and joy filled the streets instead of ruins and uncertainty. Their eyes sparkled with the nostalgia of a world they could barely remember, but refused to let die. Together, they clung to this sliver of hope, sharing stories of generosity and selflessness, reminding the next generation that even in the wasteland, the spirit of Christmas could endure.
