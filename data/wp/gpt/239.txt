It started as an ordinary day in the laboratory. Dr. Collins and his team had been conducting groundbreaking experiments on interdimensional portals. But one fateful night, they took a leap too far. As the portal opened, a blinding light engulfed the room. When it faded, they found themselves face to face with an ancient being, unmistakably... God.
Fear gripped their hearts as they realized what they had stumbled upon. The creatureâ€™s immense power was suffocating. Its eyes, devoid of any warmth or compassion, seemed to pierce their very souls. The team knew that they had captured something beyond their comprehension.
But this newfound knowledge didn't come without a price. With each passing day, the ripples from its existence twisted their reality. Madness crept into their minds, warping their perception of the world. Shadows in the corners whispered secrets unheard. Unearthly voices echoed through the halls, driving them into despair.
The once sterile laboratory transformed into a nightmarish realm. Unholy creatures crawled from the shadows, their malevolent gazes fixed on the team. Unseen hands tugged at their sanity, pushing them closer to the edge. The boundaries between life and death blurred, as the captured deity relentlessly toyed with their lives.
Desperation consumed Dr. Collins and his team. They raced against time to find a way to shut down the portal and release this unholy prisoner. But as they stared into the abyss, they realized they were playing a game they could never win. God exists, and they had unwittingly become its prey.
