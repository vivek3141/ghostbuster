I always thought I was just lucky. Every time someone around me fell sick, I remained immune, healthy as ever. People would cough and sneeze around me, complaining about their aching bodies and constant fatigue. But not me, I was always perfectly fine.
I never paid much attention to it until that fateful day when an old friend of mine, Lucy, came over to visit. She was sniffing and coughing, clutching a box of tissues tightly in her hands. Her eyes were red and swollen, and her voice hoarse as she greeted me.
“I've caught a terrible cold, Sam,” she said, her voice raspy. “Everyone seems to be falling sick these days. I don't know what's going on.”
I looked at her sympathetically, handing her a glass of water. “Maybe it's just a bad flu season. Make sure you rest and take care of yourself. You'll be fine in no time.”
Little did Lucy know that her words would ignite a curiosity in me like never before. Why was I always healthy when others were sick? How was it that, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't catch a single cold or flu? Determined to unravel the truth, I began researching symptoms and diseases, diving deep into medical journals and scientific studies.
After countless hours spent pouring over books and articles, I stumbled upon a theory that seemed almost too fantastical to believe. It stated that every time a person fell sick in this life, it meant they had just died in another universe. Like a ripple effect, the pain and discomfort from the other universe would manifest itself in the form of illness in this world.
The more I read, the more I realized that this theory could explain my immunity. Somehow, I was avoiding death in other universes, and as a result, remained healthy in this one. It was an astounding revelation, one that made me question everything I knew about life and existence.
But as days passed, a strange phenomenon occurred. People started falling sick left and right, dropping like flies, while I remained unscathed. It was as if the entire world was suddenly plagued by an epidemic. The news reported countless deaths and hospitals were overflowing. Panic and chaos ensued, and I found myself trying to make sense of the calamity.
If the theory held true, then what could possibly be happening to me? Why was I immune to this global catastrophe? I desperately sought answers, my heart racing with each passing minute. I felt like I held the key to some incredible secret, a secret that held the power to unravel the very fabric of existence.
With every passing day, my friends and loved ones succumbed to the illness. Their devastated families mourned, and the world was gripped with fear and uncertainty. The streets were empty, save for the occasional ambulance or desperate soul seeking medical help.
As I pondered over the situation, a realization struck me like lightning. If every illness in this world was caused by deaths in other universes, then me being immune meant that my counterparts in those other universes were somehow avoiding death as well. It was a loop of evading death that somehow extended across multiple realities.
With this understanding, a sense of responsibility washed over me. I couldn't just abandon those suffering in this world. If I had the power to endure, I also had the power to heal. I started researching remedies and began establishing makeshift clinics to help the sick. I reached out to experts, sharing my newfound knowledge and working tirelessly to find a cure.
Days turned into weeks, and months into years. The world eventually regained a semblance of stability, and the sickness started to fade away. Through it all, I fought alongside scientists and doctors, determined to alleviate the suffering caused by this interconnected web of alternate realities.
Today, as I sit in my small clinic, witnessing patients on their road to recovery, a sense of fulfillment fills my being. The world has emerged stronger from this crisis, having experienced the power of resilience and unity. We now know that we are not mere victims of fate, but rather, active participants in a grand tapestry of existence. Every life we touch, every illness we vanquish, has a ripple effect that extends beyond the boundaries of this world.
I may still be immune, unscathed by the ailments that plague humanity. But I am no longer just lucky. I am a beacon of hope, a harbinger of healing. And I will continue to heal, not just physically, but spiritually, understanding the intertwined nature of life and death that binds us all.
