Once upon a time, in a land far away, a brave knight embarked on a dangerous quest. He was tasked with rescuing a beautiful princess from the clutches of an evil sorcerer. As the story goes, the knight fought valiantly, overcoming treacherous obstacles and defeating hordes of monsters to reach the sorcerer's lair.
But what if I told you this narrative was a mere fabrication of the knight's propaganda? As his former squire, I hold the key to the truth hidden behind those illustrious tales. The knight, a man driven by greed and ambition, had conspired with the cunning sorcerer to stage this elaborate ruse.
Deep in the labyrinthine dungeons of the castle, the princess was nothing more than a pawn in their wicked game. She had been promised power and riches in exchange for her cooperation. The sorcerer's true intention was to use her bloodline for an ancient ritual resurrecting a dark sorceress of unimaginable power.
Yet despite my loyalty to the knight for all those years, something inside me snapped. I could not bear witness to the impending doom that awaited the realm. In one fateful moonlit night, I broke free from their clutches, determined to reveal the truth.
But alas, dear reader, I fear my betrayal may come at a great cost. As I pen these final words, the sorceress and her minions are but a step away from breaking free, unleashing chaos upon the land. And I, the supposed antagonist, must beg you to forgive me, for the true climax of this story lies in the last line.
