In the warmth of flickering candlelight, my parents introduced my sister, Evangeline. Time whispered its secrets, yet Evangeline remained unchanged. While I blossomed, she clung to infancy like a hummingbird's wing frozen mid-flight. I watched as friends grew older and wiser, tenderly bidding farewell to innocence. But not us. Evangeline and I wove a tapestry of perpetual youth, preserving innocent laughter, skinned knees, and secret late-night stories. While others traversed life's labyrinth, we reveled in the simplicity of each other's company. Our existence became a delicate dance, untouched by age's cruel hand. As sunsets splattered the sky, we played in our eternal childhood.
