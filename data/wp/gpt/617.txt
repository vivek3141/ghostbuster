As I entered the towering fortress, I couldn't help but feel a mix of anticipation and nervousness. The air itself seemed to crackle with an unknown energy that sent chills down my spine. I was about to be interviewed for the position of an evil mastermind's henchman, and my life was about to take a drastic turn.
Standing before me was Dr. Malevolence, renowned for his diabolical schemes and cruel intentions. His piercing gaze seemed to analyze my every move, as if he could see into my very soul. I took a deep breath, determined to make a lasting impression.
"Why do you seek to join my forces?" he asked, his voice cold and calculating.
I swallowed hard before responding, "Dr. Malevolence, I am drawn to your genius, your ability to plan and execute the most intricate schemes. I have always felt confined by the dullness of the ordinary world, and I crave the excitement your organization offers."
Dr. Malevolence tilted his head, contemplating my words. "What skills can you bring to my operation?" he inquired, his eyes narrowing.
With unwavering confidence, I replied, "I possess exceptional strategic thinking, a knack for problem-solving, and a natural talent for stealth. With these abilities, I can assist you in outwitting your enemies at every turn."
The corners of his mouth curled into an intrigued smile. "Tell me, what is your greatest accomplishment in the realm of villainy?" he pressed, his tone challenging.
I paused for a moment, gathering my thoughts. "While my experience in villainy is limited, I did manage to successfully orchestrate the downfall of a corrupt corporate executive. I uncovered his illicit activities, dismantled his empire, and left him begging for mercy, shamed and penniless."
Dr. Malevolence's eyes gleamed, clearly impressed. "Very well. Should you be selected, you will be expected to dedicate your life to serving me, obeying my orders without question. Disloyalty will be met with swift and merciless punishment."
I nodded, indicating my wholehearted agreement. "I understand, Dr. Malevolence. I have no desire for anything other than complete commitment to your cause. If given this opportunity, I will prove my loyalty through unwavering dedication."
As the interview concluded, I left the fortress, my heart pounding with excitement. If I was chosen, I would be thrust into a new world, a world of darkness and intrigue. And though the path I had chosen was undoubtedly treacherous, I could not help but feel an exhilarating sense of purpose. Was I destined to become a mere henchman, or would I rise to become Dr. Malevolence's most trusted ally? Only time would tell.
