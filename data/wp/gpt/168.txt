As the clock struck midnight, Anne made a resolution to transform her life on January 1st, 2013. She vowed to exercise, eat healthier, and be more disciplined. Eager and motivated, she went to the gym on January 2nd, only to find it closed for renovations. Discouraged, she grabbed breakfast at a nearby café, only to receive a greasy burger instead of her requested salad. Feeling defeated, Anne sat on a bench, contemplating her resolution’s failure. But then she realized that setbacks don't define her determination. Embracing a new perspective, she jogged home, prepared a nutritious meal, and vowed to persist despite any obstacles.
