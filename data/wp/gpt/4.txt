Growing up, I was always a dreamer. My imagination would take me to far-off lands and introduce me to extraordinary characters. However, there was one particular character who would visit me night after night, year after year. She was a vibrant girl with a mischievous smile and sparkling eyes. We would spend hours chatting and exploring new worlds, forging a deep friendship that felt as real as anything else in my life.
As I grew older, my dreams became less frequent, and the visits from my imaginary friend became rare. Life took over, and I moved on, leaving behind the whimsical fantasies of my childhood. But even then, I often wondered what had happened to my dear friend.
Years later, in the bustling streets of the city, I caught a glimpse of her again. It was like seeing a ghost from my past, a figment of my imagination come to life. Yet, there she was, walking hastily through the crowd, her once-ebullient face now filled with apprehension.
I couldn't believe my eyes, and without thinking, I ran after her, calling out her name.
"Ella! Ella, wait!"
But she quickened her pace, desperately trying to avoid me. Determined, I followed her, dodging pedestrians and weaving through the maze of people as if my heart depended on it. Eventually, she paused, turning to face me, her eyes filled with angst and a flicker of recognition.
"Please, just leave me alone," she whispered, her voice quivering with emotion.
I was taken aback, hurt by her sudden change in demeanor. After all those years of friendship, how could she treat me like a stranger? I demanded answers, needing to understand why she evaded me.
"Why are you running away? Don't you remember me? We were friends!"
Ella's eyes welled up with tears that she desperately tried to hold back. "Of course, I remember," she choked out. "How could I forget? But it's not safe for us to be together anymore."
Confused and desperate, I pleaded with her, "What do you mean it's not safe? We were just children when we were friends!"
Ella glanced around nervously, checking for any signs of danger. Then, she leaned in closer and whispered, "They're watching us, always. Our friendship was too peculiar. We were never meant to meet in real life."
Her words sent shivers down my spine. Something hidden in her fragile tone convinced me that she truly believed what she said. Though it made no sense, I couldn't shake off the feeling that her fear was genuine.
"I don't understand," I murmured, my voice barely audible.
Ella's gaze met mine, filled with sorrow and regret. "I wish I could explain, but I can't. It's too dangerous."
Before I could say anything more, Ella turned and disappeared into the crowd, leaving me stranded in a whirlwind of confusion. A million questions raced through my mind, but no answers were forthcoming. My heart ached, yearning for the connection we once had, yet it seemed that the world had other plans.
Years later, as I sat reminiscing about the enigmatic encounter, a single thought occurred to me: perhaps some things are best left in dreams. And just like that, I made peace with the unanswered questions, holding onto the cherished memories of my dear, imaginary friend, forever lost in the perpetuity of my dreams.
