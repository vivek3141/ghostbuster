Ever since I can remember, my memory has been a gift and a curse. The world around me comes alive with crystal clarity, every detail etched into my mind. But there's something else, something extraordinary. I have memories from before I was born.
It started when I was a child, fragments of distant moments lingering in my thoughts. I could vividly recall the touch of my mother's hand before I ever felt it. I could hear my father's gentle voice whispering sweet lullabies in the darkness of the womb. These memories, though inexplicable, were my secret treasure.
As I grew older, my abilities only intensified. I remembered the brushstrokes of ancient paintings, the scent of long-extinct flowers, and the whispers of long-lost languages. I could recount historic events that predated my existence, as if I had been there myself. It was overwhelming, this constant deluge of the past flooding my mind.
People were fascinated and frightened by my gift. They questioned how it was even possible, but I had no answers. All I knew was that my memories were a part of me, a tangible thread connecting me to a past I had never experienced.
With time, I've come to accept my extraordinary ability. Instead of dwelling on the enigma behind it, I have chosen to use it to enrich the lives of others. I became a historian, sharing stories from forgotten eras and breathing life into forgotten tales. My gift became a bridge between the past and the present, connecting people to the beauty and wonder of history.
Now, as the years pass by, I continue to navigate the labyrinth of time, weaving its stories together. And though my memories from before I was born may forever remain a mystery, they serve as a constant reminder of the rich tapestry of life that extends far beyond our individual beginnings.
