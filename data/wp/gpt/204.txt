As our crew landed on the far side of the moon, we marveled at the barren landscape before us. But then we discovered remnants of an old settlement, abandoned with haste. Torn structures and broken equipment painted a haunting picture. Rusty machinery conveyed desperate attempts to survive. How had we missed this in our briefing? Unearthly whispers echoed in the eerie silence as we pieced together remnants of a tragic past. Moon dust whispered ancient secretsâ€”we were not the pioneers we presumed, but the latest in a line of forgotten explorers. We would learn from their mistakes, for the moon would not claim us too.
