As the time machine whirled and sparkled, I braced myself for the inevitable leap across centuries. But as the vortex cleared, my heart sank. The familiar sights of home were nowhere to be seen. The time machine had malfunctioned, landing me in a time period I wasn't supposed to reach. Panic gripped me, for the world before my eyes was unrecognizable. Jetpacks soared above while holographic advertisements glowed on buildings. The aroma of alien cuisine wafted through the air. Lost in the future, I vowed to fix the machine, praying it could take me back, begging for the comfort of my own time.
