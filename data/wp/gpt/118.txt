Ahoy, me hearties, gather round,
I'll spin for ye a tale profound,
Of an island in the distant deep,
Where dragons fly and secrets keep.
'Twas a land surrounded by azure seas,
Where the dragon isles danced with the breeze,
Guarded fiercely by three women bold,
Their stories, legends yet untold.
The first was Rosie, with flaming hair,
A tempest rage, none could compare,
With fiery spirit, she stood her ground,
To protect the island, her dragons, renowned.
Then there was Lily, with eyes so keen,
A huntress born, her aim, unseen,
With bow in hand and arrow true,
No enemy could escape her view.
Lastly was Bella, the wise and serene,
Her words like gold, her heart a queen,
She bore the knowledge of ancient roam,
And in her presence, wisdom will bloom.
Together they sailed amidst the tide,
With dragon wings, they took their stride,
The island shrouded in mystery rare,
Its secrets guarded with utmost care.
Dragons gleamed in the sun's warm glow,
With scales that shimmered, a mighty show,
In harmony, they danced and soared,
Their fiery breath, their mighty hoard.
But one day came a pirate crew,
With greed and darkness to pursue,
To snatch the dragons, to rule with might,
And claim the island, lost from sight.
But Rosie, Lily, and Bella stood,
United as one, they knew they should,
With swords unsheathed and hearts aflame,
They fought for the dragons they held no blame.
As the battle raged with thunderous sound,
The pirates fled, their treasure unfound,
The island stood proud, the dragons remained,
A testament of the women unchained.
So hear me shanty, a tale of courage bold,
Of an island guarded against pirates untold,
Through legends sung, let their bravery live,
Three fierce women, their souls will thrive.
Ahoy, me hearties, let our voices ring,
Of the island where dragons took wing,
And when the sea sings this tale divine,
May their bravery echo throughout all time.
