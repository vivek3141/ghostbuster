Once upon a time, there was a curious and imaginative 7-year-old child named Lily. She was an inquisitive soul, constantly questioning the world around her. One sunny afternoon, as Lily was playing in her secret garden, she spotted a peculiar creature lurking behind the bushes. It had a mischievous grin and fiery eyes that seemed to hold infinite knowledge. It was none other than the devil himself.
Lily's eyes widened with both curiosity and fear. She had heard tales of the devil and his cunning ways, but her insatiable thirst for knowledge pushed her to approach him cautiously. Summoning all her courage, she mustered a small voice and said, "Hello, Mr. Devil. May I ask you a question?"
The devil, intrigued by Lily's audacity, nodded and beckoned her closer. Lily took slow, hesitant steps towards him until they were eye to eye. "Why do you do evil things?" she asked, her voice filled with genuine wonder.
The devil smirked and replied, "Ah, little one, I do not do evil things. I merely present choices to humankind. It is they who choose the path of darkness over light."
Lily pondered his response, her innocent mind trying to grasp the complexity of human nature. "But why do they choose darkness, Mr. Devil? Why don't they always choose light?"
The devil chuckled softly, patting Lily's head. "That, my dear child, is a question even God has struggled to answer for thousands of years."
Lily's eyes lit up with determination as she looked straight into the devil's haunting gaze. "Then I shall ask Him," she stated resolutely.
With a flick of his tail, the devil transported Lily to the gates of heaven. The sheer magnitude of its beauty left Lily breathless. Angels adorned in radiant white robes floated blissfully in the sky, and the sound of heavenly music filled the air. Lily's heart swelled with awe and wonder.
Guided by her childlike intuition, Lily soon found herself in the presence of God. She knelt before the Almighty, her small voice echoing through the celestial chamber. "Dear God, why do people choose darkness over light? Why do they do evil things?"
God, ever compassionate and understanding, acknowledged Lily's presence with a smile. "My child, humans possess free will, allowing them to make choices. But darkness exists as a counterpart to light, for it is through struggle that they find courage, compassion, and ultimately, love."
Lily listened attentively, her young mind trying to process His words. She looked up at God and asked innocently, "But can't you make everyone always choose light? Can't you stop the darkness?"
God's eyes twinkled with admiration for the wisdom hidden within the young child. "My dear Lily, if I were to remove darkness entirely, there would be no room for growth and understanding. It is through their choices and the challenges they face that they learn and evolve."
Lily nodded, her face reflecting acceptance and understanding. With a resolve that only a child could possess, she knelt before God once more and whispered, "Then, God, I will show them the light. I will inspire them to choose love and goodness."
And so, armed with wisdom and the unwavering belief that good prevails, Lily returned to Earth. Through her words, actions, and unwavering love for all, she managed to touch the hearts of countless people. In her short conversation with the devil, she had accomplished something God had sought for thousands of years â€“ the ability to inspire humanity to choose light over darkness.
As the years passed, Lily's legacy grew, and her teachings continued to guide generations. She became a shining example of the immense power that compassion and love can hold, reminding the world that even a young child can change lives, challenge darkness, and bring forth the brilliance of light.
