Once upon a time, in a parallel universe, the Americas were not colonized by Britain but by Spain. Christopher Columbus, a bold Spanish explorer, embarked on a journey across the Atlantic Ocean, searching for a new trade route to the East Indies. However, fate intervened, altering the course of history.
In 1492, Columbus and his crew reached the shores of the Bahamas, oblivious to the continent that lay nearby. As they treked through the Caribbean islands, rumors began to circulate among the indigenous tribes that beings from a faraway land had arrived.
Meanwhile, back in Spain, news of Columbus' discovery spread like wildfire. King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, thrilled with the prospect of new territories, funded more expeditions to explore this newfound land. Spanish explorers, driven by their desire for gold, glory, and the spread of Catholicism, set sail toward the western hemisphere.
One such explorer was Hernán Cortés. Inspired by tales of unimaginable wealth, he led his expedition to the shores of Mexico in 1519. However, instead of finding an Aztec Empire at its height, an expansive Spanish colony awaited him. Decades prior, the Tenochtitlán Emperor, Moctezuma II, had fallen prey to Spanish tactics and ultimately crumbled under their dominance. Spain successfully established a formidable presence in Mesoamerica.
As the years passed, the Spanish established trade routes stretching from Veracruz to the Mississippi River. They built magnificent cities with architectural wonders rivalling the ancient Rome itself. Spanish language, culture, and religion pervaded the New World. The lands, tightly controlled by the Spanish Crown, were divided into viceroyalties and ruled through a centralized government.
The Spanish colonies flourished. From the silver mines of Potosi to the sun-drenched plantations of Cuba, wealth poured into Spanish coffers. However, as the empire swelled, so did dissent. Inspired by their European Enlightenment counterparts, Spanish intellectuals began questioning the legitimacy of royal rule. Calls for independence rang out with fervor, inspiring a new wave of revolution.
In 1776, the American colony of Nueva España followed the footsteps of their British counterparts, adopting principles outlined in the Declaration of Independence. The revolutionary leaders, men like Miguel Hidalgo and José María Morelos, fought for the rights of all people, regardless of race or social class. With Mexican Independence, the dominion of Spain ceased north of the Rio Grande.
Spaniards, determined to maintain influence over their former colonies, continued exerting their control over the remaining Spanish territories. They encouraged the settlement of the western frontier, hoping to solidify their dominion over the vast region. The American West, now predominantly Spanish-speaking, stretched from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean.
As the British Empire grew, it continued to expand into the northeastern regions of North America, where indigenous tribes struggled to defend their lands. The British colonists moved swiftly, pushing Native American tribes farther west while establishing their rule firmly in the east. Thirteen British colonies fought for independence from Great Britain in 1776, under the guidance of leaders such as George Washington and John Adams.
Meanwhile, in Nueva España, the Spanish attitude toward their indigenous counterparts was less aggressive. Spanish rulers adopted a policy of coexistence and intermarriage between the Spanish and Native American populations, significantly reducing conflict. This cooperation between the two cultures allowed them to peacefully share the lands and use collaborative efforts to protect their territories against external threats.
Fast forward to the 20th century, America had evolved into a rich tapestry of Spanish and indigenous cultures, entwined more closely than ever before. Spanish architecture and traditions flourished across the continent, coexisting harmoniously with native customs. The Spanish language remained dominant, but native languages were preserved and celebrated.
As the world changed, so did the face of America. Spanish-speaking America became a global powerhouse, rivaling the British Empire, and commanding vast territories across the globe. The world marveled at the cultural richness and immense contributions birthed by the Spanish colonization of America.
In this alternate reality, where America was colonized by Spain, the course of history forever changed, unleashing an era of unparalleled cultural diversity and innovation, setting the stage for a world where Spain and its empire reigned supreme.
