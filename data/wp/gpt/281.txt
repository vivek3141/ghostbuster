Once a jovial young man, Alex fell victim to a witch's curse. With a clandestine spell, she stole his heart and replaced it with a shard of ice, frigid and unfeeling. As the ice engulfed him, his capacity to love withered away. Relationships soured, warmth became alien to him. He watched, helpless, as friends and family drifted apart. Time passed, yet the ice remained, untouched by the sun's rays. Afraid that love's fiery touch would melt his icy heart, he hid behind a cold facade. Little did he know, the power of love lies in its ability to thaw even the iciest of hearts.
