I had always believed in the power of destiny, in the idea that there was someone out there who would complete me. Like everyone else, I bore the last words of my soulmate etched on my skin. But when I read the words that adorned my body, disbelief washed over me. "I never loved you."
How could this be? How could my soulmate, the person who was supposed to bring me joy and happiness, say those soul-crushing words? It felt like a cruel joke from fate, an indescribable pain that resided deep within my being.
As time passed, the words became a constant reminder of my heartache. I retreated into solitude, my spirit enveloped in a cloud of melancholy. Daily life became a monotonous routine as I struggled to find solace, grappling with the bitter reality etched into my skin.
However, as I immersed myself in self-reflection, I realized that the words on my body did not define my worth. I refused to let them diminish my capacity to love and be loved. Instead of wallowing in despair, I made a choice to rise above it.
I began to seek solace in my own company, pursuing my passions, and surrounding myself with genuine affection from friends and family. I discovered that I held the power to heal my wounded soul, to rewrite my own narrative.
And in time, the agony of those words faded away, replaced by a newfound strength and resilience. Though my soulmate may never reciprocate the love I had to offer, I learned to love myself fiercely, refusing to let the pain define me.
For there is beauty in the scars we bear, testament to the battles we have fought. And mine, well, they tell a tale of resilience, self-love, and finding happiness within the confines of my own heart.
