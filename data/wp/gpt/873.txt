I couldn't help but blurt out, "I've always hated Aunt Margaret's potato salad!" The deafening silence in the car made my heart sink. My mom's eyes welled up, dad gripped the steering wheel tighter, and my sister glared at me as if I were a monster. The missile suddenly malfunctioned, sparing us from oblivion. The rest of the car ride was painfully awkward, haunted by the unintended confession that revealed my true feelings.
