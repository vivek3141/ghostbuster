As I realized my newfound power to control others, I felt an unsettling weight settle upon me. Testing my ability, I chose a passerbyer, his body obediently following my command. But then his consciousness spoke to me, gentle pleading in his voice. What have you done to me? Release me, please! Overwhelmed, I immediately released him, guilt coursing through me. From that day forth, I vowed to use my power responsibly, only intervening when truly necessary. Each time, I could hear the person's consciousness, their hopes and fears, reminding me of their humanity. With great power, I learned, came even greater empathy.
