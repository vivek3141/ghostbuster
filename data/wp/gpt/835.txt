It was a warm summer evening when Max, a petty thief driven by desperation, entered a dimly lit bar seeking his next illicit opportunity. Desperation clouded his mind, guiding him towards an unspeakable act – stealing organs. His heart pounding, he spotted a lonesome figure sitting at the counter, a perfect target.
Alejandro, a regular at the bar, sat nursing his drink, his melancholy masking a secret he had long kept hidden. Max approached him cautiously, summoning his courage and a vial of potent sedative. With a few drops, the unsuspecting Alejandro soon succumbed to the depths of unconsciousness.
In the inky night, Max dragged Alejandro to a dark alley, his mind consumed with visions of wealth awaiting him. He readied his tools, sharpening his knives, ready to extract his ill-gotten bounty. However, as he made his initial incision, a wave of confusion swept over him. There was nothing. No organ to be found.
Anxiety gripping him, Max examined Alejandro more closely. His skin was pallid, his body alarmingly lightweight. Could it be that this man was merely an apparition, a shell of a person? The realization shook Max to his core. He had wrongly assumed that everyone possessed organs to be harvested, but Alejandro was the stark exception.
The truth began to dawn on Max – Alejandro was devoid of the very essence that Max, in his desperation, had longed to exploit. Lost in his thoughts, he pondered the why and how of it all. Maybe Alejandro had undergone a life-altering procedure, or perhaps he was simply born without organs. Whatever the case, it was clear that the man was not the appropriate target for his appalling deeds.
Regret twisted Max's stomach as he gazed at the unconscious figure before him. He had allowed desperation to cloud his moral compass, leading him down the path of darkness. A path he could no longer traverse.
Max gently laid Alejandro back in the alley, a glimmer of integrity surfacing within him. In that moment, he vowed to change his ways, to seek redemption for his misguided intent. He disappeared into the night, leaving behind the shadows and the sinister plot he had nearly committed. And as his footsteps faded, he hoped Alejandro would never remember this night, a story intertwined with their lives—the thief consumed by desperation, and the man without organs.
