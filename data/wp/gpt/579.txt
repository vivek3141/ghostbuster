The first time she called you "mama," you couldn't have been happier. Her innocent voice echoed with love and trust, binding your souls. You promised endless protection. Years passed; she grew, radiating with laughter and curiosity. But the world turned cruel, labeling her a monster for defending herself against those who preyed upon her. The last time she called you "mama," her voice trembled, blending despair with unbearable pain. The world failed her, twisting truths into lies. As her fragile body faced execution, your heart shattered. Devastated, you vowed to fight for justice, preserving her memory forever.
