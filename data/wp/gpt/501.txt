The small bell above the door jingled as the customer stormed into the convenience store, her face twisted in anger. Her eyes were narrowed into slits, and her lips were pressed tightly together. She approached the cash register with such force that it seemed as though the ground shook beneath her heels. I stood there, trying to maintain my cool, but a bead of sweat trickled down the back of my neck. It was going to be one of those days.
"What took you so long? I've been waiting for ages!" she exclaimed, her voice dripping with impatience.
"I apologize for the inconvenience, ma'am," I responded, struggling to keep my voice steady. "What can I assist you with today?"
"Well, it's about time!" she barked. "I need a pack of cigarettes, and make it quick!"
I turned around to grab the requested item from the shelf, bracing myself for the inevitable confrontation. As I placed the pack on the counter, the customer scowled at me, her eyes filled with pure contempt.
"Just ring it up already," she hissed through gritted teeth.
I did as instructed, trying my best to avoid making eye contact as I reached out my hand to take her payment. But as soon as our fingers met, she yanked her hand back and glared at me.
"What the hell was that for?" I asked, bewildered.
"Don't touch me, you demon!" she yelled, her voice echoed throughout the store, causing a few heads to turn.
Startled by her sudden outburst, I quickly withdrew my hand. Confusion washed over me like a tidal wave. Had she mistaken me for someone else? But before I could utter another word, she leaned in close, her eyes burning with fury.
"Go to hell!" she screamed, her face turning bright red.
I raised an eyebrow, a flicker of amusement passing through my eyes. With a calm voice, I replied, "I can't."
Her face contorted, and her rage intensified. "What do you mean you can't?!" she demanded.
"Satan still has a restraining order against me," I said, maintaining my composure.
The customer's expression morphed into one of disbelief. She laughed, an icy tone laced within her voice. "You think I'm stupid? That's the dumbest excuse I've ever heard."
I remained silent, a small smirk tugging at the corner of my lips. I had long grown accustomed to people's skepticism and disbelief regarding my situation.
Seething with anger, the customer reached for the pack of cigarettes and hurled it towards me, missing my head by mere inches. "You're a smart ass, you know that?!" she spat. "I'm never coming back to this lousy store!"
As she stormed off in a huff, I couldn't help but chuckle to myself. It was moments like these that made my bizarre life somewhat entertaining. But in reality, I had spoken the truth. Satan really did have a restraining order out on me.
It all started a few years ago, when I had an accidental run-in with Lucifer during a walk in the park. Completely unaware of who he was, I had innocently confronted him about his choice of dark clothing in the middle of summer. Little did I know that it was a grave offense in his realm.
From then on, Satan seemed to take a personal interest in me, tormenting me day and night. He would possess various individuals, causing chaos in my life, and there was no place I could hide.
Desperate for a solution, I consulted an exorcist who specialized in restraining orders against supernatural entities. After a lengthy court battle in the underworld, we managed to secure a restraining order against Satan himself. The Judge of Hell wasn't too thrilled about it, but the exorcist had pulled some strings, and it worked.
Ever since then, I had been living my life cautiously, always mindful of any potential encounters with Satan or his minions. However, it seemed that the mere mention of this restraining order was enough to send anyone into disbelief or fits of laughter.
As the day went on, I tended to my duties, serving customers with a smile and a sprinkle of sarcasm. And just when I thought I had seen it all, a disheveled man walked through the door, his eyes darting around nervously. My intuition told me that he was different, that he was here for a purpose.
His gaze met mine, and he cautiously approached the counter. "Are you the one they call the 'restraining order guy?'" he asked in a hushed tone.
I nodded, unable to conceal my curiosity. "That's me. What can I do for you?"
He leaned in closer, lowering his voice even further. "I think I need your help. I may have angered someone, and I fear for my life."
Intrigued, I motioned for him to proceed. "Who are we dealing with?"
A shudder ran down his spine as he whispered, "Asmodeus, the King of Demons."
My eyebrows shot up in surprise. Asmodeus was notorious for his wrath and deceit. I couldn't help but let out a dry chuckle. It seemed like my adventures in dodging the supernatural were far from over.
With a mixture of amusement and determination, I looked at the disheveled man and said, "Well, let's get started, shall we?"
