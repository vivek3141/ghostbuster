"I don't have a heart," she said coldly, her voice devoid of any emotions. She tapped her chest, and unexpectedly, a hidden hatch opened, exposing whirring gears and a mysterious compartment. Curiosity piqued, I watched intently as she reached in with delicate fingers and pulled something out.
In her hand, she held a small, beautifully crafted locket. With trembling hands, she opened it, revealing a tiny portrait of me nestled inside. It was then that I realized her declaration was true: she might not possess a physical heart, but the locket held her unspoken emotions. Silent tears fell from her eyes, and I knew that if she did have a heart, it would undoubtedly belong to me.
