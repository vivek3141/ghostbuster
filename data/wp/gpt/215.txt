As dawn painted the sky in hues of pink and gold, they stood at the edge of a fading world. Tears glistened in their eyes, yet hope burned fiercely within. The clock ticked mercilessly, reminding them of an impending farewell. "We've still got time. Not enough, but enough," she whispered, her voice filled with determination. Hand in hand, they chased dreams, ignored doubts, and embraced each fleeting moment as if it were their last. Beneath an ancient tree, they vowed to make every second count. For even though time may be short, their love would forever endure.
