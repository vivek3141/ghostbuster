As the dust settled, my heart sank realizing I was the only one left. Michelle, my last companion, had succumbed to the harsh aftermath of humanity's arrogance. The world lay desolate, a graveyard of bustling cities and laughter-filled homes. We were once a flourishing race, but now we were extinct. In a surreal sense of loneliness, I wandered through our abandoned memories, clinging to fragments of the past. The last human, burdened by unbearable solitude, haunted by the voices of those I once cherished. Now, I carry their legacy, navigating this empty world, searching for a glimmer of hope amidst the silence.
