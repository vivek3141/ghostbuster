For centuries, the immortal pleaded with the cosmos to grant him mortality. He yearned to be embraced once more by Death, his eternal love. Countless times, he tested his boundaries, but life clung to him unwaveringly. Desperation consumed him; he traversed treacherous lands, consulted sages, and communed with ancients. Yet, with each attempt, he discovered the resilience of his cursed existence. The immortal persevered, his beacon of love guiding him through the ages. Until one day, as his despair reached its zenith, he realized that the true reunion he sought showed itself not in death, but in cherishing the eternity they shared.
