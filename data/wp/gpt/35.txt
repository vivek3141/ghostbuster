Sarah had a gift unlike any other. Since she was a child, she could see soul escorts, ethereal beings that appeared when someone's time on Earth was about to come to an end. These escorts were there to guide the departing souls to the afterlife, ensuring a peaceful transition. It was a burden and a blessing, for she understood the vulnerability of every life around her.
On a sunny afternoon, Sarah found herself sitting in a crowded bus, gazing out of the window lost in her thoughts. Suddenly, her attention was drawn to the other passengers, or more specifically, the lack of them. The bus she was on seemed to be filled with soul escorts, shimmering figures in various shapes and sizes.
Confusion consumed her as she tried to comprehend the sight. She had never seen so many soul escorts in one place before. It was as if an invisible veil had been momentarily lifted, revealing the imminent fate of everyone aboard the bus.
Sarah's heart raced as she studied the escorts. Some were comforting, radiating a warm glow as they softly whispered words of solace to their soon-to-depart souls. Others had a somber demeanor, their presence hinting at the grief that was to come. The atmosphere was heavy with an unspoken truth.
Amidst the sea of escorts, Sarah's gaze fell upon an elderly man sitting alone at the back of the bus. The soul escort beside him was distinct from the rest; it shone brighter with an aura of tranquility. Sarah felt a strange connection with this particular escort, almost like an old friend guiding her through the unknown.
As the bus rumbled along its route, Sarah watched the soul escorts interact with their charges. She marveled at their grace, compassion, and dedication. Each escort tailored their approach according to the souls they nurtured. It was a silent dance of understanding.
Minutes turned into hours, and eventually, the bus reached its final destination. Sarah watched as the passengers disembarked one by one, accompanied by their respective escorts. She felt a mixture of sadness and awe, realizing that life was truly ephemeral.
When the elderly man got up to leave, Sarah couldn't help but approach him. She softly spoke, "Excuse me, sir, but I noticed that your escort seemed quite special. Are you alright?"
The man smiled at her, his eyes filled with wisdom. "My dear, today is my final journey. That escort you see is a manifestation of all the love and compassion I have shared throughout my life. It is here to guide me to my eternal resting place."
Sarah nodded, tears welling up in her eyes. She had witnessed something profound and gained a renewed understanding of the importance of cherishing every fleeting moment. As she stepped off the bus, she vowed to honor all the souls she had encountered that day, striving to make a positive impact on the world, just like the escorts who guided them home.
