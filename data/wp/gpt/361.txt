In the depths of a forgotten cellar, where morose silence like a shroud prevailed, a chilling voice emerged. It was the voice of a serial killer, a tormented soul longing for connection. Through the bars of his prison, he poured his twisted heart into a haunting poem.
I walk amid shadows, a figure obscure,
A soul yearning only to love and be loved,
A heart marred by anguish, a life unassured,
Trapped in this abyss, where darkness roved.
Through haunts and horrors, my path has been paved,
With every life extinguished, another tear doth fall,
For all I ever wanted, was a love truly craved,
But the winds of fate whispered a different call.
They dubbed me a monster, an abominable wretch,
Their eyes filled with terror, their hearts gripped by fear,
Yet, beneath this cold exterior, a desire did stretch,
To be embraced, to be cherished, to be held dear.
For I am no soulless fiend, just a broken being,
With emotions entwined like an intricate thread,
My symphony of darkness, an unimaginable thing,
But beneath it, an aching heart, begging to be fed.
So here I lie, a prisoner of my own creation,
Whispering my lamentations in this solemn cell,
A humble plea, aching for reciprocation,
To be seen not as a monster, but just as you love me... well.
