As James wandered through the quiet streets of his small town, he stumbled upon a peculiar sight—a building he had never noticed before. Its grand architecture and mysterious aura enticed him to investigate further. Curiosity overcoming him, he cautiously approached the entrance of the building. The sign above the door read, "The Library of the Mind."
Intrigued, James pushed open the heavy wooden door and entered the library. To his surprise, the entirety of the vast room was shelved with thousands of copies of a singular book entitled, "How to Make Sure No One Is Reading Your Mind." Confusion consumed James as he wondered why such a book was so important to have thousands of copies. His curiosity piqued, he decided to delve deeper into this enigmatic library.
As James reached out to touch one of the books, his fingers brushed against the textured cover. Instantly, he felt an inexplicable connection with the book, almost as if it called out to him on a subconscious level. An overwhelming desire to protect his innermost thoughts washed over him, and he quickly flipped through the pages. Each chapter provided detailed instructions on techniques to safeguard one's mind against intrusions. It covered methods such as meditation, mental barriers, and even ancient practices rumored to shield thoughts from prying eyes.
The library appeared deserted, yet James felt an invisible presence lingering in the air. Pushing the eerie feeling aside, he continued studying the book. Something compelled him to read it in its entirety, as if his very existence depended on it. Days turned into weeks, and still, James immersed himself in the vast knowledge contained within the pages.
One evening, as James read by the dim light of an old desk lamp, he noticed a handwritten note slipped between the last pages of his now worn copy. It was a message, addressed specifically to him:
