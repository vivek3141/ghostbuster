For the past century, the world had been plagued by the arrival of demonic portals. Populating cities and towns, these gateways brought destruction and chaos wherever they appeared. No corner of the globe was safe. Governments attempted to contain these portals, but their efforts proved futile, and hope slowly dwindled.
One fateful day, the largest portal opened in the heart of New York City. The sky turned blood-red, buildings crumbled, and terrified screams filled the air. Amidst the apocalypse, only a small child stood unharmed in the very spot where the metropolis once thrived.
Unbeknownst to anyone, this child possessed a power that defied comprehension. With wide, innocent eyes, the child gazed at the portal, undeterred by the demons surrounding them. A luminous aura enveloped the child, radiating hope and defiance.
In this pivotal moment, the child's power surged. Their tiny arms outstretched, and a wave of energy rippled through the air, engulfing the demons. Shrill cries echoed, mingling with the child's unwavering determination. Slowly, the encroaching darkness receded.
With each flicker of the child's fingers, the portal shrank, losing its dominance over the ruined city. Light pierced through the chaos until the portal vanished entirely, leaving only a sigh of relief in its wake.
As the dust settled, the child stood amidst the remnants of destruction, their small frame a testament to resilience. Whispered rumors of the child's importance spread among the survivors, sparking a newfound hope that humanity could once again stand strong against the demonic scourge.
In the wake of annihilation, one small child emerged as the beacon of the world's salvation.
