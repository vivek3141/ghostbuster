Once in a forest, so deep and so dark,
Roamed a creature named Frank, a monster with a spark.
With claws like razors and fangs drippin' with goo,
He lived all alone, nobody knew.
Children would wander, curiosity their guide,
Into the haunted forest where Frank did reside.
He'd wait in silence, his red eyes glowing bright,
Watching them closely, hiding in the night.
Then one sunny day, arrived a young lad,
Timmy, just ten, brave but a tad mad.
He ventured too far, lost in the dense maze,
Unaware of the eyes that fixed upon his gaze.
Frank pounced from behind, his claws gripping tight,
Whispering darkness and filling Timmy with fright.
The boy trembled and cried, pleading for his release,
But Frank, fuelled by hunger, refused to appease.
Silent screams echoed through the trees,
As Frank devoured the innocent with ease.
He feasted on children, one by one, every day,
Their lives extinguished, innocence taken away.
The townfolk grieved, their hearts filled with despair,
Parents warned children, "Beware, don't you dare,
Enter the forest where the monster awaits,
For there lies a darkness that brutality creates."
And still, to this day, the horrific tale persists,
A twisted Dr. Seuss story that leaves hearts in twists.
So remember young ones, always stay on the path,
For evil, like Frank, seeks to unleash its wrath.
