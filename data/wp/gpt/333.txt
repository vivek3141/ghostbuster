In the depth of a moonless night, a young boy, Alex, found himself wandering through the thick forest. He had heard tales of monsters living within the inky blackness that engulfed the trees. Fear began to creep into his heart, and he quickened his pace.
Suddenly, an eerie silence fell. The darkness seemed to stretch out like a spider's web woven across the world. With each step, Alex felt the weight of his own fear rise, but little did he know that darkness too possessed a fear of its own.
As Alex journeyed deeper into the woods, he sensed a presence lurking behind the colossal trees. His pulse quickened, yet he continued forward, refusing to surrender to his own dread. The darkness recoiled before him, intimidated by his bravery. Its tendrils quivered, afraid of the light within his heart.
Alex soon stumbled upon a small, wounded bird, its wings trembled in fear. He cupped it gently in his hands, feeling the warmth of its frail body against his palm. Tenderly, he whispered soothing words and promised to protect it from harm. The bird rested peacefully in his care, unburdened by any fear of the dark.
In that moment, Alex understood that darkness fears the light within us all. It craved our courage and determination to push through it, to bring forth the brightness of hope, and to illuminate the path for those who have yet to discover their own strength.
Embracing the light within, Alex continued his journey, knowing that the darkness was just a mere shadow, always receding before the power of his empathy and love.
