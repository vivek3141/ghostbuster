She stared at him across the table, her eyes red from tears. They had been through so much together, but it had finally come to this - the painful realization that it was better to let go. Emily took a deep breath, trying to find the courage to say the words she never thought she would utter.
"It sucks, but you both know it's better to just cut ties," she said quietly, her voice trembling.
David nodded, his face a mix of sadness and resignation. It wasn't an easy decision, but they had arrived at a crossroads, where staying together only meant more hurt. Their once vibrant love had faded, giving way to arguments and broken promises. They had tried to fix things, to salvage what they could, but it seemed futile now.
"No one wants to give up on love," David murmured, his voice choked with emotion. "But we deserve happiness, and staying together will only breed unhappiness."
Emily fought back tears, her heart aching at his words. She had loved him with everything she had, but they had become strangers, clinging to fragments of what used to be. The thought of a future without him terrified and saddened her, but deep down, she knew it was for the best.
They both knew that walking away would be the hardest thing they had ever done, yet they were resolved to put their own well-being first. The room fell silent as they accepted the inevitability of their decision. They shared one last, bittersweet embrace before releasing each other, knowing that their paths would now diverge.
And with that, they both began the slow, painful process of healing, knowing that sometimes, love means letting go.
