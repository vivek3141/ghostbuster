In the year 2020, the Earth was thrust into chaos as alien invaders descended upon us. Our cities crumbled, our governments fell, and our loved ones were taken from us. Humanity teetered on the edge of extinction, until a desperate agreement was made. Earth's survivors were ordered to pay a tithe every decade, offering up one-tenth of our population, in exchange for temporary respite from enslavement.
Now, the year is 2060, and I find myself among the chosen. For years, I have feared this day, questioning the morality of sacrificing our own just to prolong our own survival. But now, I refuse to go quietly.
As the designated day arrives, I stand before a vast gathering of survivors, their eyes dulled with resignation. The time for meek acceptance has long passed. With a fire burning inside me, I address them all, my voice breaking through the numb silence.
"We've endured for forty years under this oppressive agreement," I begin, my words resonating with a newfound determination. "But what do we truly gain by sacrificing our brothers and sisters? We may survive, but will it be worth it?"
Murmurs spread through the crowd, giving me hope that perhaps I am not alone in this resistance. Hesitant gazes meet my own, and a flicker of hope reignites in my heart. I feel a tremor of unity building within us.
"We have the strength, the resilience, and the audacity to fight. It's time we gather our spirits and stand against their demands. No longer shall we succumb to their tyranny."
A swell of applause and cheers erupt from the crowd, spreading like wildfire. I can see the determination returning to their eyes, the spark of rebellion igniting deep within their souls.
From that day forth, we became the resistance, refusing to fuel the flames of subjugation. We scattered throughout the hidden corners of the world, organizing strikes, gathering intelligence, and rallying others to our cause. Our numbers grew with each passing day, until we became an army ready to face our alien oppressors.
The year is 2060, and I stand before the alien overlords, unyielding and unafraid. Behind me, the unified voice of humanity shouts in defiance. We refuse to be mere pawns in their game. Together, we will fight for our freedom, for a future where every life is valued and cherished, free from the shadows of fear.
And so, humanity rises once again, its spirit unbreakable, unwavering in the face of tyranny.
