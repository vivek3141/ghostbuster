In a realm hidden beyond the veil of existence, Death, a supernatural being, wandered aimlessly through eternity. A solemn duty befell him: to bring an end to the lives of mortals. Death was cursed, however, for he could only see one person at any given time, and he knew he must always kill that individual.
Throughout the ages, Death obeyed his eternal mandate with precision. He did not discriminate, nor did he display mercy. It mattered not if the person was young or old, saint or sinner—the chosen one’s fate was sealed when Death focused his ethereal gaze upon them.
One fateful day, as Death hovered over a bustling city, his eyes fell upon Isabel, a young girl with a glimmer of innocence in her eyes. She was the one he saw, and he saw only her. Inexplicably drawn to her, Death watched her life unfold from cradle to grave. He witnessed the tender joys and immense sorrows that accompanied her existence. 
As the eons passed, Death realized the weight of his curse. He was no longer a harbinger of doom; he became a witness to the beauty of life. The sorrow of snuffing out existence consumed him, and he yearned to defy his nature.
Guided by love, Death made a choice. He relinquished his power, casting aside his innate ability to choose only one life to end. Death became a silent guardian, prologue to a new existence beyond the earthly realm.
No longer limited by fate, Death had become something more profound—a gentle guide, patiently whispering in the ears of lost souls, helping them find solace in the darkness. And with each journey he undertook, Death learned a little more about the meaning of life, forever grateful for the glimpse of humanity that his curse had granted him.
