Death had grown fond of this elderly man, their weekly conversations filled with laughter and poignant reflections. Each time, they rummaged through the man's cherished memories, debating the meaning of life and the inevitability of mortality. But this time, Death couldn't bear to deliver the inevitable news. They stared at their bony hands, trembling at the thought of taking him away. As they sat beside the old man, intertwining their fingers, Death whispered, "You've been the light within my darkness. But the time has come, my friend." Tears streamed down Death's face, knowing this goodbye would be the hardest of all.
