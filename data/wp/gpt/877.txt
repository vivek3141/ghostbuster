With a screech, the car spun out of control, careening towards the edge of a cliff. Time stood still as panic gripped my heart, my life flashing before my eyes. In a desperate act, I threw my hands in the air and cried out, "Jesus, take the wheel!" 
And then, as abruptly as it had begun, the chaos ceased. I slowly peeled open my eyes, expecting the worst. To my astonishment, I found myself unharmed, crouched by the side of the road. But Jesus wasn't driving. No, he wasn't there at all.
Instead, seated behind the wheel, a stranger turned toward me, their eyes filled with warmth and compassion. My pulse raced as they smiled gently, a soothing presence amidst the madness. 
"Are you alright?" they asked, their voice a soothing balm to my frayed nerves.
Bewildered, I found my voice and stammered, "Wh-who are you?"
The stranger chuckled softly, their voice bearing a comforting familiarity. "Call Me Grace," they said, their eyes shimmering with divinity. 
As comprehension dawned upon me, my legs shook beneath me, and I sank to the roadside, overwhelmed by the encounter. In that moment, I realized that it didn't matter who was behind the wheel, for divine intervention came in many forms. And with Grace by my side, I knew I would be alright.
