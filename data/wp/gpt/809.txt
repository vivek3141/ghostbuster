The prison walls held no threat for me. I was an immortal, a predator with an insatiable craving for blood. Death had become my masterpiece, but now I found myself confined within these bleak walls. They called me the immortal serial killer, and yet, they had managed to capture me.
Sentenced to life in prison, the most ironic punishment they could devise. I knew they suspected something was amiss, but my immortal affliction remained hidden beneath an unyielding mask. However, time unveiled the prison's suspicion, as the guards grew bewildered at my unchanged appearance.
Years blended into decades, and the world outside continued to evolve, yet I defied the ravages of time. Whispers echoed within the prison's concrete corridors, the rumors of my eternal youth spreading like wildfire. The guards looked at me with wary eyes. They knew something was wrong, something inexplicable.
Determined to expose my secret, they subjected me to countless experiments, probing for a source to my unnatural existence. But their efforts were in vain. I protected my secret fiercely, leaving them with nothing but futile endeavors.
As the centuries passed, I watched the world grow, flamboyant colors fading into monochrome shades. I saw wars waged, civilizations rise and fall, and yet here I remained, shackled to my prison.
My thirst for blood remained unsatisfied, and I enacted my darkest fantasies within the confines of my cell, feasting on the souls of those too weak to comprehend my true nature. Over time, my gruesome acts transferred from mere entertainment to desperate survival.
The prison soon became an asylum of terrified souls, aware of their impending demise at the hands of a predator they could not understand. Conflicting emotions wrestled within me, countless lives snuffed out, their existence merely prolonging my own eternal torment.
The years became a blur, blending into one another, as the prison walls served as my grim companion. The guards grew older, their faces marred with wrinkles and wisps of gray hair. They watched me, their gazes filled with a mix of awe and terror.
And so, the day arrived when the prison decided to release me. The world outside had changed beyond recognition, yet I remained the same. I walked free into a new millennium, forever cursed by my immortal affliction, forever stalked by the shadows of my past deeds.
