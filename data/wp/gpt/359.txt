As John took his final breath, a strange sensation washed over him. He found himself enveloped in darkness, unable to move. Suddenly, a glowing text window appeared before him.
"Welcome to new game+, John," it read, "You will begin your life anew, but retain all knowledge, skills, currency, and items you choose to carry over. The challenges and enemies will be adapted to your level accordingly. Good luck!"
Confusion swirled within him as he tried to comprehend the meaning behind the words. Was he being given a second chance at life? Gathering his courage, he decided to accept this mysterious offer.
John's eyes blinked open, and he found himself as a baby cradled in his mother's arms. Memories flooded his mind, a floodgate of experiences both happy and sad. He smiled at his mother, recognizing her from the photographs he had seen.
As the years passed, John grew stronger, both physically and intellectually. He was able to speed through school, excelling in every subject as if he had an innate understanding of the material. With his newfound knowledge, John began investing his pocket money in stocks, turning small amounts of cash into substantial fortunes.
As a young adult, John discovered he still possessed the items he had cherished in his previous life. He now held a book of code, understanding complex programming languages with ease. Jobs were at his fingertips, and he even created a significant breakthrough in artificial intelligence, becoming a renowned expert in the field.
Every challenge John faced was met with determination, his past experiences guiding him towards success. Relationships flourished, and he became a beacon of inspiration to those around him. The enemies he encountered were but mere stepping stones, defeated by his unparalleled comprehension of life's intricacies.
Time moved swiftly, and in his final years, John surveyed a world that had benefited from his innate abilities. The knowledge and skills he had retained had not only improved his life but countless others as well. As he closed his eyes one last time, he whispered, "Thank you for the journey."
In that final moment, the text window appeared once more, filled with words that sparked a newfound hope in John's soul: "Congratulations, John. You have completed new game+. Please accept our gratitude for enriching this world. Would you like to continue your journey in new game++?"
