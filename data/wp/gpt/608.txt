In the bustling city, a shy librarian named Emily noticed a handsome stranger visiting her library every day. They exchanged a few glances, but both were hesitant to make the first move. One evening, Emily left a small note inside a book she knew he would borrow. It read, "Meet me tomorrow at the park bench, 5 PM." Overwhelmingly nervous, they arrived early and waited anxiously. Each desperate glance passed the other, yet neither approached. Years went by, the chance of love forever lost. A timeless mist of "what if" lingered, haunting their hearts with the saddest love story untold.
