Harry Potter sat on the stool, his heart pounding as the Sorting Hat rested atop his head. The echo of its previous declarations faded away, leaving him alone with his thoughts. "Gryffindor," he whispered under his breath like a mantra. Gryffindor was where he belonged; it was the house of bravery and loyalty, the home of heroes that he had admired for so long.
The Sorting Hat seemed to hesitate, as if caught in a moment of contemplation. A hush fell over the Great Hall as everyone held their breath, anticipating the decision. Then, with a voice that boomed through the room, the Sorting Hat exclaimed, "Slytherin!"
Time stood still, and Harry's heart sank. His mind raced with confusion, and he felt a twinge of disappointment. Slytherin? But that was where the dark wizards resided. It was a house renowned for cunning and ambition, not for love and courage. How could he ever fit in there?
As he made his way to the Slytherin table, he heard whispers and saw skeptical glances from his fellow students. Yet, among them, he noticed a few friendly faces trying to hide their surprise. Draco Malfoy, the confident and ambitious boy he had met on the train, offered a knowing smile.
Over the years, Harry realized that Slytherin house was not entirely defined by the darkness it was associated with. With his own bold spirit, he brought change from within. Together with Draco and others, they challenged old prejudices and forged new alliances.
Sometimes, it takes an unexpected path to find one's true destiny. And so, Harry Potter became the embodiment of courage within the very house that doubted him, proving that bravery and friendship can be found in the most unlikely places.
