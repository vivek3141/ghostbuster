In the dark depths of the alien mother ship, a sense of urgency suffocated the atmosphere. Upon receiving the devastating news about the imminent human invasion, the alien overlord's eyes widened in disbelief. "What!?" he roared, trembling in his monstrous form. "How is this possible?"
The overlord's advisor, trembling under the immense pressure, hesitated before responding. "Well, um..." he stammered, trying to find the right words. "They... they ate our ammunition."
The overlord's massive form slumped, a mixture of despair and confusion enveloping him. "Ate? How can those puny creatures consume something as vital to our success as our ammunition?"
A shrug escaped the advisor's trembling shoulders. "It appears that their digestive system allows them to consume almost anything. They found our caches of ammunition and, well, ingested them."
Enraged, the overlord pounded his immense fists onto the command console, causing it to quiver under his strength. "We have underestimated these humans! How foolish of us to not have considered their ability to consume whatever they please!"
The advisor, eager to rectify the situation, suggested an alternative course of action. "Perhaps we could find a way to neutralize their ability to consume our ammunition. Maybe a defensive shield?"
The overlord's eyes glowed with fiery determination. "Yes, a shield! We must harness our advanced technology to create an impenetrable barrier around our ammunition. If they cannot consume it, they shall be defenseless."
A renewed sense of hope filled the overlord, his towering figure radiating confidence. The plan was set into motion, and scientists worked tirelessly to construct the protective shield.
Days turned into nights, and the alien invasion loomed ever closer. The humans rounded up their defenses, unaware of the desperate efforts taking place aboard the mother ship.
As the final moment approached, the shield was finally operational. The overlord donned his battle armor, his voice resonating through the corridors. "Today, we shall show the humans the might of our advanced civilization!"
With a thunderous roar, the alien armada descended upon the human stronghold. But this time, the spearhead of their forces was backed by an impenetrable shield surrounding their ammunition.
To the humans' astonishment, their weapons proved futile against the barrier. Panic began to spread among them, and their resistance crumbled before the relentless alien onslaught.
The alien overlord, triumphant in his success, roared with satisfaction. The humans, once confident in their ability to repel the invasion, were soundly defeated.
From that point on, the aliens maintained an interstellar dominance unchallenged. The humans, their spirit broken, were reduced to submission. And as for the overlord, he never forgot the lesson learned that day â€“ never underestimate the power of an enemy, no matter how insignificant they may seem.
