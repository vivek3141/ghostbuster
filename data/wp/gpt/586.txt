The Great Hall was weighed down by a heavy silence as Sir Galahad stood accused, his reputation as the king's most trusted knight crumbling to dust. The once grand hall was now a theater of darkness, where justice had been smothered by the betrayal of kin. The king had been murdered, and all fingers pointed towards Galahad.
With sweat beading on his forehead, Galahad addressed the Royal Court. His voice trembled, betrayed by his own desperation. "I stand before you today, innocent of this grave crime that stains my honor. I loved my king, and I would never raise my blade against him." Narrow, accusing eyes bore into him, waiting for a flicker of guilt. "I implore you to consider the Queen as the real perpetrator; her cold heart is shrouded in darkness."
Gasps escaped the lips of the onlookers, their disbelief transforming into fervor as Galahad weaved his tale. "I have witnessed the Queen's desiresâ€”I have seen the venom in her eyes as she would whisper her hatred for the king. She yearned for power, and when that power was denied her by marriage, deceit became her weapon of choice."
Whispers swept across the hall, growing louder as Galahad's voice faltered. His gaze landed on the queen, her pallor pale, devoid of emotion. He knew his case was falling on deaf ears. The Royal Court was loyal to the crown, and the Queen's porcelain image seemed too radiant to be shattered.
"My lord," Galahad pleaded, turning to the king's closest advisor, "you of all people know the darkness that resides within the Queen's heart. You have seen her true nature; do not let her deceive you." His voice hung in the air, wavering like a dying flame.
One by one, the councilors shook their heads, their faces etched with doubt and pity. The truth was buried beneath the Queen's beautiful facade. They couldn't fathom the possibility that the very woman who stood beside them could harbor such malice.
Tears welled up in Galahad's eyes as he realized his fate was sealed. "I beseech you, noble court, do not send an innocent man to his death. I have served this kingdom and its king faithfully, and it is only justice that I seek."
But justice seemed a distant dream, fading into oblivion. The Queen's graceful smile widened, her eyes filled with victory. Galahad's voice faded, echoing against the grandeur of the Great Hall, as his cries for truth fell on deaf ears.
The king's most trusted knight was condemned, his pleas silenced. Galahad's final gaze locked onto the Queen, promising her that he would not rest until her treacherous deed was unveiled. The voice of righteousness had been stifled, leaving a bitter taste in his mouth as he faced his inevitable defeat.
