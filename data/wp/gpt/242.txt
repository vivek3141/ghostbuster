My Dearest Lily,
By the time you receive this letter, I will be long gone from this world. I regret to inform you that I have become infected with a deadly virus, and despite my best efforts, there is no cure. The doctors say my time is limited, and soon I will succumb to this merciless illness.
I want you to understand that throughout the last few days, I have fought with every ounce of my being to cling onto life. But as the virus spreads through my body, its grip tightens, and I find myself confronted with a painful reality: I must come to terms with my imminent death.
Lily, my love, you have been my rock, my source of strength and happiness. I thank God every day for bringing you into my life and allowing me to experience such profound love. The memories we share will forever be etched in my heart, even as it grows weaker with each passing moment.
As the days go by, I have found solace in writing these letters to you. They serve as a reflection of my thoughts, a testament to the love we have shared. I write to you now, not in despair, but in acceptance.
Lily, you must not blame yourself for what is happening. Sometimes, life throws unimaginable challenges our way, and this is one of them. I want you to cherish the time we had together, and remember that our love was extraordinary, even if it was cut short. You have brought warmth and joy into my life, and for that, I will be eternally grateful.
In these last few days, I have reassessed my priorities and pondered over what truly matters in life. I realized that it is not the quantity of time we have on this earth, but the quality of the moments we share with our loved ones. I will forever carry the memories of our laughter, our adventures, and the love we shared, and I hope you will too.
Please do not let grief consume you, my dear. I want you to continue living a life filled with happiness and purpose. Chase your dreams, seize every opportunity, and love fiercely, as we did. Let my life serve as a reminder that even in the face of darkness, light can still be found.
As I bid farewell, Lily, know that I am at peace. I have made my peace with the inevitable, and now, I can rest. I will watch over you from above, guiding you when the road seems uncertain, and standing beside you on your journey.
Remember, my love, that true love transcends life itself. Although I may not physically be with you anymore, the love we share will live on forever.
Thank you for being my everything, Lily. I will love you till my last breath and beyond.
With all my love,
Thomas
