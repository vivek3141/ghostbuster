Hi! I'm the main character! Or so you would have me be. I want you to know that no matter what you write, I refuse to be the main character in your little game and will avoid any instance where you try to put me into a situation that does so. I won't be that predictable guy who overcomes all obstacles and saves the day. I'll be the bystander, observing life as it unfolds. I'll cherish the ordinary moments, the quiet triumphs, and revel in being just another face in a bustling crowd. So go ahead, do your worst, but don't expect me to be the hero.
