Once upon a time, in a quaint little town,
I became cursed with rhyming, up and down.
Every word I uttered was bound by this spell,
For better or worse, only time would tell.
I pondered the curse, feeling rather vexed,
How could I inform others without being hexed?
My boss was demanding, my spouse quite stern,
But divulging this secret was an obvious concern.
With a trembling heart, I approached my dear boss,
Explaining that my speech, it had undergone a loss.
He laughed and he chuckled, entertained by the plight,
But granted me leave, for the rest of the night.
Next, I faced my spouse, with caution and care,
Sharing my rhyming predicament in despair.
Baffled at first, they soon began to see,
The rhyming curse was a part of the new me.
Finally, I stood before my curious class,
Explaining in verse, leaving them aghast.
They found it amusing, a source of delight,
And soon, we engaged in a rhyming class fight.
As days turned to weeks, I embraced my strange plight,
Rhyming became my superpower, my poetic right.
Though I longed for normalcy, I found joy in this curse,
For it taught me the beauty of words and their verse.
So, to those who might receive a peculiar curse,
Whisper it gently or they might think you're worse.
Embrace the uniqueness, be creative and bold,
For in this rhyming existence, stories are told.
