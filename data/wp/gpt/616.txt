In the heart of Gotham City, Batman gracefully maneuvered through the darkness, his cape billowing in the wind as he pursued his arch-nemesis, The Joker. For years, this twisted villain had haunted the city with his manic laughter and senseless chaos. Finally, Gotham's dark knight had cornered him, ready to bring an end to his reign of terror once and for all. 
The Batmobile sped through the empty streets, the deafening roar of its engine echoing in the night. But as Batman focused on his mission, a growing urgency built within him. Unbeknownst to him, his stomach began to churn, reminding him of a more primal need.
Pressing a button on the console, Batman's voice boomed through the car's speakers. "Alfred, I need you to do me a favor."
"I'm here, Master Bruce," Alfred replied, his voice tinged with concern. "What assistance do you require?"
"I need you to access the Batmobile's autopilot," Batman replied, his voice strained. "I trust you can take control for a short while."
As Alfred assumed control of the vehicle, Batman closed his eyes briefly, willing his body to maintain focus against the desire that threatened to consume him. The pursuit led them to an abandoned carnival, where The Joker stood, grinning maniacally, waiting for his adversary.
With each step closer, the sensation tightened its grip on Batman's gut, urging him to abandon the imminent duel and find release elsewhere. Determined, he resisted, unwilling to let his own bodily functions overshadow his mission. 
"Batman, you're late!" The Joker jeered, his voice dripping with mockery. "Did you have a little detour?"
Ignoring the taunts, Batman lunged at his foe, their bodies colliding in a brutal contest of strength and endurance. Blow after blow was exchanged, each one adding to Batman's predicament. Sweat poured down his face, both from the physical exertion and his growing discomfort.
At the climax of their struggle, as Batman finally had The Joker at his mercy, he felt a drop of sweat slip down his spine, a chilling reminder of his most pressing need. A glance toward the shadows hinted at a public bathroom nearby, but the risk of leaving The Joker unattended was too great.
Summoning every ounce of willpower, Batman delivered a final punch, knocking The Joker into unconsciousness. Relief washed over him, both from his victory and the realization that the battle was nearly won in more ways than one.
With The Joker secured and the police alerted, Batman sprinted towards the hidden convenience of solitude. In those moments of quiet release, he marveled at the multifaceted nature of his existence, where even heroes must answer their own primal calls.
Emerging from the restroom, feeling lighter both physically and metaphorically, Batman knew that Gotham City would now truly be free from The Jokerâ€™s reign of terror. And while the darkest nights often held unimaginable challenges, he would always rise above them, even amidst the most unexpected trials.
