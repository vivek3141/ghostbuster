Adam couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss in his relationship with Rebecca. Over the years, it seemed she held a deep disdain for him, constantly plotting ways to sabotage his life. But, to his surprise, each of her malicious attempts inadvertently ended up making his life better.
One day, Rebecca tampered with Adam's work project, hoping it would lead to his ultimate downfall. Instead, his boss recognized Adam's resilience in overcoming the obstacle, promptly promoting him. When she bribed his friends to abandon him, it only opened doors to meeting new, genuine companions. Rebecca's destructive behavior backfired every time, showering blessings upon Adam.
Despite the adversity, Adam realized he was head over heels in love with Rebecca. Oblivious to her hidden agenda, he planned a romantic proposal by the beach, wanting to spend the rest of his life with her. As he got down on one knee, the waves crashing soothingly in the background, Adam poured his heart out, unaware of her true intentions.
Tears glistened in Rebecca's eyes as she listened to his heartfelt words. A wave of guilt washed over her. She had always misunderstood Adam, projecting her own insecurities onto him. With each sabotage attempt, she hoped to confirm her own doubts about his love. Yet, here he was, proving her wrong once again.
With a trembling voice, Adam asked, "Rebecca, will you marry me?"
In that moment, she chose love over resentment. Tears of regret mingled with tears of joy as she nodded, accepting his proposal. Little did they know, their future together would be filled with genuine love and understanding, washing away the bitterness of the past.
