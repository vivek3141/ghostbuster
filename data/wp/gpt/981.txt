In a dystopian future where crime has become a distant memory, I found myself as one of the very few individuals still incarcerated on the entire planet. On the outside, the world seemed peaceful, with cities blooming under the banner of prosperity and advancements. But within the walls of my prison cell, I remained confined, isolated, and forgotten.
They called me the "Last Convict." An archaic title in a world where jailers had become obsolete. The irony was not lost on me. Time seemed to stand still within these gray walls, as I pondered the weight of my actions, the sins of my past. 
As a young man, full of misguided passion, I had fallen into a life of crime. Theft, fraud, and extortion became my lifeblood, fueling a never-ending cycle of greed and deceit. But such stories were now confined to books and crumbling newspapers, relics of a world long gone.
I thought back to the day when my freedom, like an illusion, crumbled before my eyes. A collective agreement had been reached; governments around the world declared a unified mission to eradicate crime. They devised a plan so intricate, it mesmerized even the most skeptical minds.
Year after year, crime rates plummeted. Technologies were developed to identify criminal tendencies at birth, offering early intervention and psychological restoration. Laws were implemented that focused on rehabilitation rather than punishment. Police forces slowly transformed into social workers, dedicated to mending the fraying fabric of society.
It wasn't immediate; it was a gradual transformation that spanned centuries. Each generation created a world slightly better than the last. Fear and injustice were replaced with opportunities and equality. The world had moved on, leaving behind hardened criminals like myself, relics from an extinct era.
Among the dwindling population of prisoners, I labored to be worthy of redemption. I offered assistance to my fellow inmates, taught them skills and knowledge that would prepare them for a life of freedom. Though surrounded by despair, a part of me clung to the flickering flame of hope.
One day, as the world finally closed the last prison facility, I stood alone, the final inmate. The prison gates creaked open, and as I stepped out, the world welcomed me with both confusion and awe. People marveled at the sight of something they had only heard about in whispers and shadows.
I took my first steps into this brave new world, no longer confined by the past, or the prison walls that had caged me for far too long. The sun warmed my face, and the scent of freedom filled my lungs. I would forever be marked as the Last Convict, a reminder of a world long gone, reminding humanity to cherish the progress they had made.
Indeed, the world had evolved, leaving behind the darkness that had once consumed it. And as I embraced the possibilities that awaited me, I vowed to use my own redemption to shed light on the path ahead, to ensure that the mistakes of the past would never be repeated.
