In a small, forgotten town nestled amongst towering mountains, lived an old man named Benjamin. For many years, Benjamin had been the local librarian, surrounded by thousands of books and countless stories. But as time passed, the bustling town began to dwindle, and the library grew lonely and quiet.
One fateful day, Benjamin suffered a severe heart attack. Alone and frail, he managed to reach his phone and call for help. Days turned into weeks, and news of his condition spread through the town. People talked about their beloved librarian and reminisced about the stories he shared.
It was during one of these conversations that something extraordinary happened. A group of teenagers wandered into the library, curious about the tales they heard of the old man. As they pulled open the creaky wooden door, an ethereal presence filled the room. They discovered Benjamin's lifeless body, seated in his favorite armchair, eyes closed, as if deep in slumber.
Word spread through the town, from friend to friend, whispering tales of Benjaminâ€™s last moments. His name was uttered one final time by the teenagers who discovered him. With each passing second, the memory of Benjamin began to fade, like a distant echo slowly disappearing.
They say you die twice. Once when you stop breathing and the second, a bit later on, when somebody mentions your name for the last time. Benjamin's second death came before the first. As the only witnesses, those teenagers unknowingly fulfilled the role of the town's historian, inadvertently preserving Benjamin's legacy for eternity.
And so, in that forgotten town, Benjamin became immortal, forever etched within the walls of his beloved library, remembered by silent shelves full of stories and the whispers of those who dare to venture through its doors.
