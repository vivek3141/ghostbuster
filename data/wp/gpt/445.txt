I awoke, anxious to check my number—732 million above my head yesterday. But as I glanced into the mirror, my heart raced. The reflection displayed a perplexing sight: 237! I staggered, questioning what this bewildering reversal meant. The world continued as usual, everyone blindly fixated on their dwindling numbers. I sought answers, confiding in strangers who simply stared in disbelief. Hidden from society's ignorant gaze, I stumbled upon a hidden faction. A number-stripped group, unaffected by the headcount. They explained my newfound discrepancy was no mistake—it heralded a shift. United, we vowed to uncover the truth, for the world needed liberation from this deceptive numerical control.
