I woke up one morning with a foreign presence lingering in my mind. Thoughts raced, but they weren't mine. Echoes of a past life danced through my consciousness, a voice unfamiliar yet eerily comforting. It whispered tales of grand adventures and secret realms beyond imagination. I tried to resist, fearing I was losing my sanity. But resistance only deepened our connection. Our souls entwined, sharing thoughts, dreams, fears. Together, we set out on a journey of self-discovery, unmasking hidden potential. They were not me, but a part of me nonetheless. And slowly, I realized that being lost only meant finding a companion within.
