As I drove down the long, desolate road in the dead of night, a sense of unease settled over me. Every 15 minutes or so, I would see a hitchhiker standing by the roadside, one arm raised in a desperate plea for a ride. But against my better judgment, I chose to ignore them, not wanting to invite any trouble into my car.
Hours passed, and the darkness seemed to grow thicker around me. But then, as I glanced in the rearview mirror, I noticed something strange. The hitchhiker I had bypassed earlier was standing there again, his lone arm raised into the night. Doubt tinged with confusion settled within me, and a shiver trickled down my spine.
I continued my journey, my gaze fixated on the desolate road and the hitchhikers that scattered along its path. But no matter how far I drove, I kept coming face to face with the same individual, his figure hauntingly repetitive in every mirror and reflection I caught.
Images of horror movies and tales of supernatural beings began to fill my mind, shaking me to my core. “What game is this?” I muttered to myself, my grip tightening on the steering wheel. My rationality urged me to turn back or pick up this persistent hitchhiker, but fear rooted me to that seat.
Unable to bear this surreal situation any longer, I finally pulled over. Trembling, I opened the car door and gestured for the hitchhiker to climb in. The moment he sat beside me, a somber smile crept upon his lips. “Thank you, kind stranger,” he whispered.
A crippling realization struck me abruptly. The hitchhiker turned out to be a spirit forever trapped on this never-ending road, doomed to seek solace in the kindness of passersby. My heart ached for the relief I was able to provide him, even if only for a fleeting moment.
As I resumed my journey, this time accompanied by the ethereal presence, I hoped that maybe, just maybe, my small act of compassion would free his tormented soul from an eternity of loneliness.
