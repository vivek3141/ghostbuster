The rain poured relentlessly outside, covering the city in a film of melancholy. I sat in the dimly lit room, facing my latest mark - a man known in the underworld as 'The Whisper.' He owed a considerable debt to the boss, and it was my job to make him pay, one way or another. As 'The Interrogator,' I was known for my ability to make anyone crack, to make them spill their deepest secrets. But this time, there was an added weight on my shoulders.
In this dystopian world, lifespan was determined by a word count. Each person was born with a finite amount, and the moment they ran out of words, death ensued. I, on the other hand, was given millions of extra words. An exception made by the boss, presumably to increase my efficiency. But now, my efficiency was turning into a burden, as my mark had only one word left to spare.
The Whisper sat across from me, sweat-soaked and trembling, the room filled with an air of fear. His eyes darted around, searching for an escape that didn't exist. His reputation as a ruthless and taciturn man earned him the name 'The Whisper' in the first place. But now, ironically, he was left with only one word to utter before his life would expire.
I lit a cigarette, letting the smoke curl and dance in the air, a habit to fill the uneasy silence that occupied the room. I knew that the time for small talk was long gone; I needed to break him and break him fast. I leaned in, my voice a low murmur, "One word left, Whisper. One. Make it count, my friend."
His eyes glistened with a mixture of desperation and resignation. I had seen this look before, but never under such dire circumstances. He stared at me, the weight of a lifetime clinging onto his lips. Finally, in a voice barely above a whisper, he uttered his final word, "Why?"
The room fell into silence once more, my thoughts echoing around the confines of my mind. 'Why?' he had asked. It was a question that sparked curiosity within me, even though time was of the essence. Maybe there was a way to save him, to find a loophole in this cruel game of existence we were all playing.
I reached into my pocket and pulled out a worn, tattered notebook filled with pages upon pages of words. It was my secret weapon, my hidden treasure. While others had to be cautious with their words, I was free to write as much as I desired, and each word I wrote could be passed onto someone standing on the brink of the abyss.
I flipped through the pages, searching for the perfect word that could stave off his imminent demise. And then, like a soft whisper in the wind, I found it. "Silence." I scribbled it down on a piece of paper, and with trembling hands, slid it across the table towards the Whisper.
His eyes widened, hope lighting up his face like a candle in the storm. A single tear rolled down his cheek as he read the word. But before he could question what it meant, I held up my hand, silencing him. My voice, usually filled with conviction, now faltered, "Write this word down, Whisper. It will grant you silence in every sense of the word. No more talking, no more words expended. An eternal silence that will save your life."
The Whisper took the paper and stared at it for a moment, contemplating its significance. Finally, he nodded, his gaze filled with gratitude. With that, he took a final breath, preparing to embrace a lifetime of unspoken words.
As the door creaked shut behind me, I couldn't help but wonder what would become of the Whisper. Would his silence bring him peace or torment? Had I saved his life or merely prolonged his suffering? The rain continued its relentless descent, washing away the remnants of our conversation, leaving only the echoes of my doubts in its wake.
One thing was certain: even though I had saved him from imminent death, the weight of his silence would continue to weigh heavily on my conscience. But that was the price I had willingly paid in this life, an existence filled with words and consequences, where even a single utterance became a precious commodity, and the absence of it an eternal burden.
