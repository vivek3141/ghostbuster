Once upon a time, a distressed soul stumbled upon an ancient lamp. Rubbing vigorously, he freed a genie, tasked with granting three wishes. Excitement surged as the man shared desires for wealth, power, and love. Confoundingly, the genie smiled, embracing the man's figurative pleas. The first wish stirred his inner potential, motivating him to create prosperity through hard work and innovation. The second wish unveiled the true power of knowledge, enlightening him with wisdom and harmony. As the final wish unfolded, the genie brought forth selfless love and compassion within him. The confused man eventually realized that the genie had granted desires far more profound â€“ the transformation of his soul.
