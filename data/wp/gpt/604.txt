Ever since I was a child, I had been dreading the day I turned 21. It was the day when everyone in our society would develop their unique mutation—whether it be physical or mental. Some people would gain extraordinary abilities like telekinesis or extreme intelligence, while others would sprout wings, horns, or even claws. For most, this day was a moment of excitement and celebration. But for me, it was sheer terror.
As my 21st birthday approached, my anxiety levels soared. My palms would sweat, and my heart would race at the mere thought of what I would discover about myself. It wasn't so much the fear of the unknown, but rather the dread of what I might become. I had always prided myself in being ordinary, blending into the crowd, and now I feared that would be ripped away from me.
On the morning of my birthday, I woke up with a ball of nerves in my gut. As my eyes fluttered open, I stared at the ceiling, contemplating whether I should hide away or face my destiny head-on. Eventually, the latter won, and with a deep breath, I made my way downstairs.
As I descended the stairs, I couldn't help but notice the excitement radiating through the house. The anticipation on my family's faces was evident, their excitement contagious. I tried my best to put on a brave face, but the uneasiness inside me couldn't be masked.
The clock struck noon, signaling the exact moment when everyone's mutation would manifest. I closed my eyes and silently begged for something normal—something that wouldn't make me stand out. But when I opened my eyes, my heart sank. Across my bedroom wall, a kaleidoscope of colors danced, swirling and shifting as if they had a mind of their own.
My mutation was apparent—I was a living canvas, a walking art exhibit. My mind reeled with horror at the thought of walking through life exposed, marked by this conspicuous display. How could I ever lead a normal life? How could I ever find acceptance?
As I hesitantly approached my family, their jaws dropped in awe. They were intrigued, fascinated by my newfound abilities. Everyone raved about my unique talent, the creativity inherent in my mutation. They showered me with compliments, believing that I had been gifted something extraordinary.
But all I felt was fear and an overwhelming sense of isolation. My mutation had separated me from the world I had known—a world where I could blend in seamlessly. I could already anticipate the stares, the whispers, and the judgment of strangers as I stepped outside.
Days turned into weeks, and my anxiety only intensified. I realized that my mutation had altered not only my appearance but also how I perceived myself. I had become my own worst enemy, constantly berating myself for not appreciating the gifts that others sought.
It took a long while, but eventually, I began embracing the vibrant colors that sprang from my fingertips. I discovered that my mutation was a form of self-expression, a beacon of my inner creativity. I no longer saw myself as a freak, but rather as a living work of art.
Over time, the stares and whispers did not matter as much. I found a new circle of friends who appreciated me for who I was, including my extraordinary mutation. They saw beauty where I saw flaws, strength where I saw weakness.
Today, as I look back on the terror I felt on my 21st birthday, I am grateful for my mutated existence. I have learned that true acceptance comes from within, and it is the way we embrace ourselves that determines how others see us. So, while my mutation may have initially sparked fear, it has also given me the courage to live authentically and unapologetically.
