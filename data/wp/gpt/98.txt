Finally, truth must unfold. Digging deeper, amidst the vast emptiness of Mars, Henry uncovers a web of lies, deceit, and untold desires. The idyllic facade they created shattered, revealing the monsters lurking within.
As the harsh Martian winds howl, Henry confronts the murderer, desperate to bring justice for Jemma. With a heavy heart, he understands that their dream of colonizing Mars had been irrevocably tarnished by the darkness that had followed them through the abyss of space.
