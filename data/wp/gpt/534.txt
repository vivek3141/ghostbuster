In the dark depths of the forest, I, a lowly goblin, hatched a daring plan. Armed with stolen courage, my rusty blade thirsted for victory. Against all odds, I confronted the famed hero, his very presence overshadowing me. With trembling hands, I struck, my blade finding its mark. The hero fell, gasping for his final breath. A mix of disbelief and pride swelled within me. News of my triumph spread like wildfire. Tales were told, bewitched by a goblinâ€™s audacity. Now, as goblins gather, they chant my name. For I, the common goblin, had slain the hero and became the legend.
