I jolted awake, my heart pounding against my chest. Sweat trickled down my forehead as I glanced around, trying to make sense of my surroundings. The familiar hum of the plane's engine filled the air, and I could see the window beside me showing the never-ending expanse of the sky.
Confusion clouded my mind as I instinctively reached for my watch. My fingertips grazed the worn metal, and I held my breath as I read the time - 9:35 am. The numbers stared back at me, mocking my confusion. It couldn't be right. Moments ago, it had read 10:34 am, just moments before the explosion.
My mind raced, desperately searching for a logical explanation. Had it all just been a dream? A vivid, too-real dream that had played out in my mind with such terrifying accuracy? I shook my head, determined to find answers.
Disoriented and still trembling with fear, I struggled to gather my thoughts. I looked around, attempting to make out the faces of the other passengers, wondering if they had shared the same haunting experience. But to my bewilderment, everyone seemed oblivious. They chatted casually, read books, or napped, completely unaffected by the turmoil that had just consumed me.
With trembling hands, I reached out to the nearest passenger, seeking solace in the confirmation of my own existence. However, as soon as my finger brushed against their arm, they vanished into thin air. Panic surged through my veins, causing my breath to catch in my throat. I tried reaching out to another passenger, but the same eerie outcome repeated itself. They all disappeared, one by one, as if they had never been there.
Fear threatened to consume me entirely. What was happening? Was I trapped in some alternate reality? My mind began to reel, trying to comprehend the impossible. It was as if the plane had been caught in a time loop, forever repeating the same ten minutes before its supposed destruction.
I frantically searched for some form of reality, but everything was warped and twisted. The furniture melted away, replaced by an endless void. Panic welled up inside me, clawing at my sanity. It was as if time itself was unraveling, leaving me floating in nothingness.
Then, just as despair threatened to overtake me, a flicker of hope ignited in my chest. A voice whispered in my ear, urging me to think back. Memories flooded my mind as I recalled the moments before my untimely demise. An image of an unassuming man seated several rows in front of me flashed before my eyes, triggering a renewed sense of determination.
I steadied my trembling hands and reached out, grabbing the man's shoulder with all the strength I had left. He turned, surprise etched on his face. But this time, he didn't fade away. The plane shook violently as if awakening from a deep slumber, and suddenly, everything snapped back into place.
The plane hurtled forward, soaring above the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean, the engine's hum filling the cabin. My watch read 10:35 am, and a wave of relief washed over me as I realized I had averted disaster. As I looked around, the passengers continued their activities, unaware of the crisis narrowly averted.
But as the plane continued on its journey, I couldn't shake off the lingering unease. I couldn't forget the alternate reality that I had just escaped. What had caused the time loop? And was this event mere coincidence or something more significant? Questions flooded my mind, demanding answers I wasn't sure I was ready to uncover.
As I gazed down at the endless expanse of the Pacific Ocean, I prayed that I would never have to relive those harrowing ten minutes again. But deep down, I couldn't shake off the feeling that this ordeal was far from over. The darkness of the void still loomed in the recesses of my mind, reminding me that sometimes, even the fabric of time itself could unravel.
