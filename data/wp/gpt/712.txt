As the veil between life and death lifted, I found myself standing before an ethereal council. They spoke in hushed whispers, reminding me that, before birth, I had undergone a character creation process. I was in shock, for I couldn't recall any of it. They informed me that I had determined my attributes, virtues, traits, and natural skills. Suddenly, it all made sense.
I had been a fool, selecting the wrong path at every turn. In life, I had been endowed with courage, yet I shied away from opportunities that required bravery. Kindness was infused into my very being, but I constantly turned a blind eye to those in need. I possessed a quick wit, yet I used it to hurt rather than heal. I had chosen the gifts of eloquence and persuasion, but only to manipulate others for personal gain.
It was devastating to realize the potential I had squandered, the wasted purpose I had carried within me. Regret consumed my soul as I witnessed the impact my choices had on those around me. My loved ones suffered through my selfishness, my lack of integrity, and my refusal to acknowledge my own flaws.
As my life flashed before my eyes, I begged for forgiveness, promising to do better if given another chance. The council granted me a glimmer of redemption, providing me with the opportunity to return to the mortal realm. This time, they assured me, I would remember the character creation process, allowing me to unleash the potential within me and create a life that bore significance and purpose.
With determination in my heart, I took a deep breath and rejoined the world, ready to make amends, to embrace the virtues bestowed upon me, and to shape my destiny with the wisdom gained from my past mistakes.
