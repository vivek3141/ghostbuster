As I stood in front of the mirror, getting ready for another mundane day at work, my heart skipped a beat. There, staring back at me, was my sister Lisa. She had passed away six years ago, leaving a void in my heart that even time couldn't fill.
I blinked, rubbing my eyes in disbelief. But her image remained, a faint reflection within the mirror. A flicker of fear tinged with excitement coursed through my veins. Hesitant, yet desperate for answers, I took a step closer. 
"Lisa?" I whispered, my voice barely audible. Her lips curled into a gentle smile, her eyes radiating an otherworldly warmth. Her fingers grazed the mirror, mirroring mine. Gathering my courage, I reached out, my hand trembling.
To my amazement, my fingers slipped through the glass effortlessly, meeting hers. It was as if a portal had opened to the realm between life and death. Our hearts connected, bridging the gap that had separated us for far too long.
Through that ethereal connection, Lisa's voice reached me in a gentle whisper, "I miss you, sis."
Tears welled up in my eyes, blurring my vision, as I choked out my response, "I miss you too, Lisa."
In that sacred moment, my sister and I exchanged stories like long-lost friends meeting after decades. She spoke of the boundless beauty of the afterlife, filled with love and serenity. I shared tales of life's creations and tribulations, the joys and heartbreaks that had shaped me in her absence.
Time seemed irrelevant within this supernatural embrace, until finally, Lisa's presence began to wane. Her image faded, like a distant memory slipping through my fingers, but her words lingered within my heart.
As I stood alone before the mirror, I knew things would never be the same. My sister had reached out to me, giving me a glimpse into the elusive world beyond. And though the glass separated us physically, the connection we forged was unbreakable.
From that day forward, I carried Lisa's wisdom with me, embracing life's fleeting moments and treasuring the love that tied us together. For even in the depths of despair, I remembered that my sister's smile within that mirror symbolized an eternal bond, reminding me to seize every moment, appreciating the beauty before me, and spreading love to all who crossed my path.
