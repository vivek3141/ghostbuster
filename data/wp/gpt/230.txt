In darkness I wait, my final breath near,
Fear's icy fingers grip my heart so clear.
No solace found, as shadows twist and creep,
Eternal night, a secret I will keep.
Cold hands embrace me, silence fills the air,
Controlled by demons, driven to despair.
They know not what they do, no conscience there,
Ghosts of their sins, a burden I must bear.
A flash of steel, a scream that echoes loud,
Unleashing pain, my soul drifting through clouds.
Blood stains my hands, the truth I can't ignore,
Regret and sorrow, the depths of my core.
But as the stars retreat, redemption shines,
The web unraveled, the past intertwines.
Bound by scarlet threads, my fate set in stone,
A dance of shadows, the truth now fully shown.
I beg for mercy, forgiveness yet unknown,
A puppeteer's play, my strings tightly sewn.
The truth emerges, woven through life's strife,
A tragic tale etched, in this dance of life.
A restless spirit, forever stuck in time,
Bound to my killer, a rhythm of crime.
In death's embrace, destiny now unfolds,
Whispers of sorrow, forever untold.
