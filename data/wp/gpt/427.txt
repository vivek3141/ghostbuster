Satan stood before the gates of Heaven, repentant and desperate for redemption. "Please, God," he pleaded, "allow me to return as Lucifer!" God pondered before presenting a condition. "Prove your reform. Resist a tremendously tempting opportunity to sin." Satan agreed, determined to prove himself. Years passed; the flames within him flickered as he faced countless trials. Finally, the ultimate test arrived. A forbidden fruit gleamed before him, its allure unparalleled. Sweat trickled down Satan's brow as he fought temptation, but his determination held firm. As God watched, Satan conquered his own desires. The gates of Heaven opened, Lucifer's sin forever forgiven.
