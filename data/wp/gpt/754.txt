I sat alone one day in my cozy living room as the soft, golden rays of sunlight streamed through the window. My significant other, Sarah, was curled up on the couch, sound asleep. We had spent the morning together, laughing and joking, but now she laid there peacefully, completely unaware of the strange fate that awaited her.
Hours turned into an eternity, and as the day went by, Sarah didn't stir. Panic began to build within me. I shook her gently, calling her name, but she remained motionless, lost in an eternal slumber. Fear gripped my heart as I realized that something was terribly wrong.
In desperation, I rushed outside, hoping to find anyone who could offer clarity or aid. But as soon as I stepped foot onto the streets, I noticed an eerie stillness. The once-bustling neighborhood was now eerily silent, and the people I encountered were frozen in time, locked in an eternal repose.
Confusion mingled with terror as I realized that whatever had taken Sarah had now spread, snaring everyone it touched. Fearful tears welled in my eyes as I roamed through the deserted streets, desperate for answers. The city's silence was deafening and crushing.
Days turned into weeks, and still, no one woke. I traversed miles, encountering countless people, but the cycle remained the same. Each person I encountered succumbed to the same cursed slumber, seemingly trapped between the realms of consciousness and oblivion.
Over time, I resigned myself to this new reality. I knew not where the hours went, yet instinctively I felt the need to care for the slumbering bodies. I fed them, bathed them, and spoke to them, despite their unresponsive state. It brought a sense of purpose, even in the midst of despair.
Years passed, and I found myself sitting alone once again in the same living room where this waking nightmare had begun. Somehow, I had grown used to the quiet solitude, finding solace in my ability to care for those who could not care for themselves. I remained the final sentinel in a world that had fallen asleep, their dreams locked away forever.
As I watched over Sarah's peaceful face, I couldn't help but wonder how long this strange phenomenon would persist. Would there ever be a day when the world would awaken from its slumber? Or had I become the last living soul in a world now destined to remain forever asleep?
