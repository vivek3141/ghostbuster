In a scorched world, a dusty DVD player lay abandoned in a crumbling building. Curiosity sparked, I pressed play on the last surviving disc. A flickering screen revealed animations of families laughing, documentaries about breathtaking landscapes, and tear-jerking movies filled with love and sacrifice. The video showcased the beauty and flaws of humanity. Mesmerized, tears streamed down my face as I yearned for those simpler times. In a world deprived of laughter and human connection, this fragile disc held the key to redemption. As I pressed the eject button, I pledged to rewrite our story, guided by the last video on Earth.
