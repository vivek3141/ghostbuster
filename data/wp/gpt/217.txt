In the heart of a small town, where secrets were whispered,
Lived a girl named Emily, her spirit untamed and free.
With eyes like emeralds and hair like golden wheat,
She carried a secret worth telling, a tale of a love so sweet.
Her heart belonged to Daniel, the boy with a crooked smile,
A love that grew in secret, away from prying eyes.
Underneath the old oak tree, they would meet and laugh,
Sharing stolen kisses, their secret wrapped in a photograph.
But fate had other plans, their love was put to test,
As Daniel was called away, leaving Emily distressed.
Years passed in silence, their secret kept within,
Until an old letter arrived, bringing news of his return.
Her heart skipped a beat, as she read his heartfelt lines,
Promising to reunite, beneath the starry skies.
On a moonlit night, the lovers found their way,
Whispering words of love, as their secret danced away.
Together they built a life, their secret now revealed,
A love that had endured, their dreams at last fulfilled.
Emily and Daniel, a tale of love so true,
A secret worth telling, a story for me and you.
