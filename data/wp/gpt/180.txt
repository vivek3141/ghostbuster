As the sun set on humanity, Sarah strolled amid deserted streets, a bittersweet silence echoing through her heart. She closed the doors of empty homes and businesses with tender care, cherishing the memories imprinted on their walls. With a heavy sigh, she extinguished the last flickering lamppost, giving way to darkness's whispered embrace. Tears streamed down her face, mourning the extinction of a vibrant world forever lost. Yet, amidst her despair, a glimmer of hope shone. For as Sarah turned off the lights, she prayed that one day, perhaps, new footsteps would fill these streets, and life would spring anew.
