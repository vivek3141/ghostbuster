As the morning sun painted the sky, Sarah reached into her special bag, expecting something useful for the day ahead. Instead, her hand grazed a feathery object. Perplexed, she pulled out... an ostrich feather? Ignoring the strangeness, she continued. A compass for a shopping trip, a snorkel for her office job. The bag's surprises grew weirderâ€”soup ladles, rubber ducks, even a disco ball. Racking her brain, Sarah uncovered a pattern. Each item was key to someone else's need. Realizing this gift was her ability to help, she embraced the bizarre as her unique superpower, ready to make a difference.
