As the sun dipped below the horizon, darkness fell upon the eerie town of Netherleigh. The townsfolk whispered tales of a haunted mansion, abandoned for years, sitting atop the hill. It was said that anyone who entered would never return.
Curiosity, however, had gotten the better of young Emma. She couldn't resist exploring the abandoned mansion. As she stepped through the creaking entrance, a chill ran down her spine. Her heart raced as her footsteps echoed through the shadows.
Deep within the mansion, she stumbled upon an ancient mirror. Covered in a thick layer of dust, it seemed to beckon her closer. Emma hesitated but couldn't resist its lure. As she gazed into her reflection, her eyes met the piercing, yellow eyes of another.
Suddenly, the mirror shattered, unleashing a curse that locked her inside the mansion. Every corner she turned, the same yellow-eyed figure loomed closer, its intentions unknown. Fear consumed Emma, until she realized the figure mimicked her every move.
Puzzled, she studied its movements and soon understoodâ€”the entity mirrored her actions perfectly, but only when they locked eyes. Determined, she approached a cracked mirror and locked onto her reflection. Slowly, she reached out, and as her fingers touched the glass, it rippled, like water.
Emma stepped through the mirror, back into her world, breaking the curse. The mansion crumbled behind her, and she gazed into her reflection one last time, grateful for the crucial eye contact that had saved her life. From then on, Emma never doubted the power of a single glance.
