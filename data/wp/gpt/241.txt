As I walked down the dimly lit hallway, I felt a wave of exhaustion wash over me. It had been a long day, and all I wanted was the comfort of my bed. The only source of light was the faint glow emanating from the porch light, filtering in through the peephole in my front door. The eerie silence of the house added to the anticipation of finally reaching my room and collapsing into blissful sleep.
Step by step, the distance between me and my bed seemed to stretch endlessly. As I neared the end of the hallway, I could feel the hair on the back of my neck stand upright. It was as if an unseen presence lurked in the shadows, watching every move. My heart pounded in my chest, the sound echoing through the vacant hallway.
Just as I reached the front door, the speck of light slid away, plunging me into complete darkness. Panic instantly seized me, causing my hands to tremble as I fumbled for the light switch on the wall. Click. Nothing. In a desperate attempt to regain my bearings, I reached for my phone in my pocket, only to find it lifeless, drained of its battery.
My mind raced with possibilities. Was this a power outage? An intruder? The unknown consumed my thoughts, clouding my judgment. I strained my ears, hoping to catch any sound that could give me a clue as to what was happening. But the silence hung heavy, suffocating me.
With a newfound determination, I decided to brave the darkness and make my way back to the safety of my bed. My footsteps echoed through the corridor as I retraced my path. The lack of light made the hallway feel like an endless maze that twisted and turned, disorienting me at every corner.
Suddenly, a chilling gust of wind enveloped me, extinguishing a weak flicker of hope that had managed to ignite within me. Fear and despair mingled, tendrils of darkness gripping my soul. But I refused to surrender to the unknown. I continued on, blindly pushing forward, driven by sheer willpower.
Finally, after what felt like an eternity, a soft glow began to seep through the cracks in my bedroom door. I kicked it open, and with a sigh of relief, I collapsed onto my mattress. The room was engulfed in the warm glow of my bedside lamp, casting away the horrors of the hallway. Exhaustion claimed me, and as sleep enveloped my being, I vowed never to forget the darkness that had haunted me that night. Yet, I couldn't help but wonder, what had caused that fleeting moment of darkness, and would it ever return?
