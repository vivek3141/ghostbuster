I never asked for this darkness that now coils within me, choking the remnants of my sanity. Life had always been simple for me, filled with moments of joy and laughter. But a sequence of events during the past weeks turned my existence into a twisted nightmare, transforming me from a simple person into a murderous savage. Allow me to recount my story, in hopes that you may sympathize with my shattered soul.
It all began with the death of my cherished sister, Anna. She had been my pillar of strength, my guiding light in this tumultuous world. The loss shattered my spirit, and I found solace only in the memories we had shared together. But that was before I discovered the truth.
Through a series of haunting revelations, it became apparent that Anna's demise was not the result of a cruel twist of fate. No, the darkness that consumed her had a name, and it belonged to a corrupt organization lurking in the shadows. They traded in innocent lives, crushing dreams with each calculated move.
Overwhelmed by feelings of grief and anger, I embarked on a quest for vengeance. I sought justice for Anna, the justice she had been denied. With a heavy heart, I entered the world that my sister had tried so desperately to shield me from – a world where moral lines blur and innocent souls are crushed beneath the weight of darkness.
My journey exposed me to the treachery and deceit that had infected the hearts of those I once regarded as allies. The sense of betrayal chipped away at my soul, driving me further into the abyss. Each life taken became a symbol of retribution, an exclamation mark upon the injustice that stained this world.
Yet, with each life lost, a part of my humanity evaporated. The line between right and wrong became blurred, and the nightmare that claimed me grew stronger. Every flash of steel, every scream, and every extinguished light were reminders of the pain that devoured my existence.
Now, standing on the precipice of damnation, I yearn for release. The monstrous creature I have become is a shell of the simple person I once was. I am a product of this wicked world, shaped by the torment inflicted upon me.
I beg you, dear reader, to understand my descent into savagery. See the transformation for what it truly is – a response to an unfathomable darkness that refused to release its grip on my shattered soul. Whether you sympathize or condemn, let my story serve as a reminder that even the simplest of us can be consumed by the horrors that lie dormant within.
