I woke up this morning feeling strange. There was a tingling in my fingertips and a buzzing in my ears. At first I thought I was getting sick, but after a few minutes I realized what it wasâ€”I had developed a superpower! 

My mind raced with the possibilities. Flight? Super strength? Laser vision? I went through a quick check. No, I couldn't lift my bed or shoot lasers from my eyes. But when I waved my hands around I realized I could create gusts of wind and small lightning bolts. I had the ability to control air and electricity!

I was so excited I rushed to tell my parents. "Mom, Dad, guess what?" I shouted. But they barely looked up from their breakfast. "That's nice, dear," my mom said disinterestedly. 

Puzzled by their lack of excitement, I went to show my best friend. "Check it out!" I said, creating a small thundercloud in my hands. 

"Yeah, that's cool I guess," he said, shrugging. "I can shapeshift into any animal. But no one really cares anymore. So many people have powers these days."

He was right. Over the last few years, hundreds of thousands of people around the world had mysteriously developed superpowers. At first it was exciting, with superheroes and villains emerging and epic battles between good and evil. But soon the novelty wore off. My ability to control air and electricity was unremarkable now. Powers had become mundane.

I realized with dismay that I had gained an ability that no one cared about. The world was oversaturated with so many superpowers that one more meant nothing at all. My lifelong dream of becoming a superhero would never come to fruition. I was just another ordinary person with an ordinary power that no one found interesting in the least. 

Dejected, I plopped down on the couch. But after a few minutes, an idea came to me. If I couldn't use my powers to fight crime, I could still use them to help in small ways. I stepped outside and used the wind to sweep debris off my neighbor's yard. I saw a kid crying because his kite was stuck in a tree, so I brought it down with a lightning bolt.

As I went about my day, I employed my abilities to help in small acts of kindness. My powers may not have been extraordinary, but for those I aided with them, they were still special. And that was good enough for me.
