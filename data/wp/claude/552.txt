The deep sea vessel Triton slowly rose from the Challenger Deep, the deepest known part of the ocean floor. Inside, Pilot Tara nervously checked the ballast tanks and propulsion systems for the hundredth time. Everything was ready. This was it - the first time any Atlantian vessel would break through the surface of the waves and embark into the strange world above.

For generations, Atlantians had wondered what lay above the all-encompassing blue of the ocean depths. Most thought the surface must consist of some impenetrable barrier, limiting their world to the deep sea vents and trenches they called home. But some dared to speculate that there could be an entirely new realm up there, with untold resources and mysteries to explore. Tara had championed the exploratory mission and was selected to pilot Triton into the unknown.

As Triton rose, the familiar ruddy glow of the hydrothermal vents faded into darkness. Tara switched on the powerful LED spotlights, illuminating motes of plankton and other microscopic sea life floating by. She checked the sonar and pressure readings nervously. According to her instruments, the surface was only 50 meters above now. But what would they find? A dead end, or a whole new world?

Tara slowed Triton's ascent as they approached the surface. No sense rushing into the unknown. She peered out the thick glass portholes, but could only see the spotlights reflecting off more plankton and particles in the water. Her copilot murmured that the pressure readings were stable, and sonar showed the surface just 10 meters above. This was it. "Preparing for surface contact," Tara said, steeling herself.

With a gentle push of the vertical thrusters, Triton broke through the surface of the water. Tara gasped. They were met not with a barrier, but air - open air! She could see further than she had ever imagined, into a vast open space. Strange lights gleamed in the distance. And the pale orb that bathed everything in a warm glow - could that be the mythical sun, source of all life and energy according to the ancient tales?

A cheer arose from the crew crowded behind Tara. They had done it. After millennia below, Atlantians had emerged into a bright new frontier of possibilities. Tara smiled, gripping the controls of Triton as it bobbed on the surface of this new sea. She took a breath of the strange air surrounding them, full of unknown scents and promises. Below, her people were still far from ready to emerge from the waters that had always sheltered them. But today, atop the waves of their ancient cradle, Tara became the first of her kind to gaze up at the stars.
