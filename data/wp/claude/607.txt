The Silent Love

Every day she saw him, sitting there in the cafe. His eyes smiled at her through thick glasses as she walked by to order her coffee.  She wanted to speak to him, to know his name, but shyness held her back, seizing her throat with an iron grip.

Week after week their eyes locked and flickered away, engaging in a delicate dance, tangoing on the edge of connection yet never quite touching. Her heart fluttered at his sideways glances, the ones he thought she didn't see. The silent affection bloomed like an orchid in the night.

One rainy Thursday his usual table was empty. Her heart sank. Had she taken too long? Missed her chance? For days she returned, hoping and fearing he had gone for good.  

A week later, his familiar figure returned. Their eyes met once more, a spark igniting between them. Summoning her courage, she walked up to him, a shy smile playing on her lips, her hand extended. 

But as she came close, the light left his eyes. He gazed right through her. She followed his blank stare to the namecard on his table. "Reserved for client meeting." Her secret love, it turned out, was not for her. The orchid withered, leaving a bittersweet fragrance where joy had once blossomed. Her heart broke for the connection that never was.
