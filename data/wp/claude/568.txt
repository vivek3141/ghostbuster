The Paladin Party 

The Paladins were a self-righteous lot, always yammering on about "law and order" and "moral virtue." They saw the world in strict terms of good and evil, and never hesitated to pass judgement on anyone who didn't measure up to their exacting standards. As fighters for justice and purity, the Paladins focused on crusading against perceived evils like chaos and corruption.

While the townspeople appreciated the Paladins occasionally dealing with actual threats, many grew tired of their preachiness and constant proclamations of moral superiority. The Paladins were quick to turn their blades and spells on any who didn't share their rigid views. Few possessed the purity of heart and purpose that the Paladins demanded.  

The Druidic Greens

In contrast, the Druidic Greens sought to live in harmony with the natural world. They spent their time outside of combat conversing with animals, meditating in the forest groves, and protesting the unchecked spread of civilization. The Greens believed that peace, love, and understanding were the greatest virtues, not just for humanoids but for all creatures.

To the Greens, the greatest threat was pollution, industrialization, and the rape of the land. While some dismissed them as eccentric hippies, others saw the wisdom in their message of environmental protection and sustainable living. The Greens' non-violent ways and affinity for the natural world made them appealing, even if their radical goals were off-putting to some.

The Arcane Order 
 
The wizards of the Arcane Order were obsessed with logic, reason, and progress through magical mastery. They believed that through science and spellcraft, all problems could be solved and mysteries revealed. While they lacked the self-righteousness of the Paladins or the naturalism of the Druids, the Order's hubris in bending the laws of magic to their will worried some.

The Order scoffed at tradition and superstition, instead favoring radical reforms and a vision of a future where magic reigned supreme as a technological wonder and driving force of society. Their promises of progress and prosperity through arcane power found many willing followers in the cities and universities. Yet if magic could solve all ills, it could also unravel the fabric of the world, should it fall into the wrong hands.
