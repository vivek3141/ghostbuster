The Strange Oven  

Jenny was excited to try out the vintage oven she had found at an estate sale. She had always loved baking and was eager to fire it up. She started simple, placing a tray of chocolate chip cookie dough inside and setting the oven to preheat. 

A few minutes later, she opened the oven door to check on the cookies but was startled to find the tray empty. Puzzled, she looked around and saw another tray of cooked cookies on the counter. “That’s strange,” she thought. She was sure she had only put one tray in the oven.

She shrugged it off as forgetfulness and pulled out the fresh-baked cookies. They were perfect. As she went to grab one, she noticed another full tray of cookies, piping hot as if just out of the oven, on the other counter. Now alarmed, she peered inside the oven again but it was empty. 

Her heart racing, she did an experiment. She placed a single cookie, the size of her palm, on the center rack and closed the oven door. A minute later, she opened it to find two identical cookies inside. She slammed the door shut. “This can’t be happening,” she said out loud.

Her mind raced, trying to make sense of the impossible. She had read stories about magical items with strange properties. Was this oven somehow enchanted? She had to know for sure.

Jenny placed her keys in the oven, set the timer for 30 seconds and hit start. When the timer dinged, she opened the door with trepidation. There on the rack sat two sets of keys, indistinguishable. Her magical oven was duplicating anything she put inside.

A grin spread across Jenny’s face as the possibilities became clear. She could duplicate rare artifacts, prized possessions, even money. Her ordinary little oven now held untold potential. Jenny laughed, wondering if anyone would believe her if she told them her secret. She decided to keep this magic to herself. At least for now. Her strange oven was sure to lead to an interesting adventure.
