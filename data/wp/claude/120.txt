The old farmhouse creaked as the wind whipped around its walls. Inside, a single candle flickered in the drafty upstairs bedroom. Anna was propped up on pillows in the bed, her breathing ragged. 

Her husband Thomas sat by her side, holding her frail hand in his own. He had known this moment was coming, but still felt unprepared. After 40 years of marriage, he couldn't imagine life without his beloved Anna by his side.

"The pain will be over soon, my dear," he whispered. Anna stirred, opening her eyes slightly.

"I'm not afraid, Thomas," she said softly. "I'm ready."  

Thomas choked back a sob. He wasn't ready. He would never be ready. But he remained strong for Anna.

"I love you," he said, kissing her forehead gently. 

"And I love you," Anna replied. "More than anything in this world."

A few moments later, her breathing slowed. Thomas squeezed her hand tighter, willing her to hold on just a while longer. But her chest stilled, and her grip went limp.  

Thomas let out an anguished cry that seemed to shake the very timbers of the old farmhouse. She was gone. His darling Anna, the woman who had stood by his side through it all, was gone forever.  

He didn't know how long he sat there holding her cold hand, lost in his grief. The candle burned out, leaving him in darkness as black as the despair that filled his lonely heart.

When dawn's first light peeked through the curtains, Thomas placed one last kiss on Anna's cheek.

"Goodbye, my love," he whispered.

He left the bedroom and walked downstairs, feeling each of his 85 years in every bone. In the kitchen, he gazed out the window to see the sun rising over the rolling hills of the farm they had built together.  

Just then, a lone red cardinal landed on the windowsill, peering in at Thomas with curious eyes. His heart swelled in his chest. Cardinals had always been Anna's favorite.   

The cardinal ruffled his feathers and took flight, soaring up into the pink-and-orange sky. Thomas smiled through his tears, suddenly finding solace. His Anna, his true love, would always be with him.
