My heart pounded as I stood outside the ominous metal door. According to the men who had brought me here, behind this door was a room with three people: one who wanted me dead, and two who would do anything to keep me alive. 

With a deep breath, I opened the door. The room was dimly lit, but in the shadows I could make out three familiar figures. My two best friends, Mark and Jenny, were there, looking terrified but determined. And in the corner, looking confused and scared, was my crush, Amy.

Mark and Jenny rushed over to me. "We're so glad you're okay!" Jenny exclaimed, gripping my hands tightly. 

"What's going on?" I asked shakily. My eyes drifted to Amy, who was watching the exchange hesitantly.

Mark and Jenny exchanged a glance. "We don't know exactly. Those men captured the three of us and locked us in here, saying that one of us was put here to kill you, while the other two were supposed to protect you."

My blood ran cold. One of the three people I trusted most in the world was here to kill me? I looked at Amy again, who quickly looked away. A sense of dread crept into my chest.

Mark stepped closer and lowered his voice. "Jenny and I think it might be Amy. She's been acting strange since they put us all in here, and she won't speak to us." 

I shook my head in disbelief. Amy? Sweet, funny, kind Amy, here to kill me? 

"It doesn't make any sense," I said. But even as I said it, bits of doubt started to creep into my mind. Amy's strange, aloof behavior. The way she was distancing herself from the others. I didn't want to believe she was capable of something so sinister, but what if I didn't know her as well as I thought?

Mark squeezed my shoulder. "It'll be okay. Jenny and I won't let anything happen to you." His voice was firm and confident, and I gave him a grateful nod. At least I still had my two best friends to rely on.

I took a few steps toward Amy, my heart pounding in my ears. This was the girl I had been dreaming of asking out for months. And now here she was, refusing to even look at me. I had to know the truth.

"Amy?" I said softly. She glanced up, and for a just a moment, I saw a flash of the girl I knew, the Amy who made me laugh and always brightened my day.

"Are you...here to hurt me?" I asked, dreading the answer.

Amy's eyes went wide. She shook her head vigorously. "No, of course not! I would never hurt you. I'm just scared and confused... I don't know why we're here but I could never do anything to harm you!"

Relief flooded through me. I gave her a small smile and held out my hand. "I believe you."

She took it, intertwining her fingers with mine, and at last I saw the familiar warmth return to her eyes. Mark and Jenny came up behind me, and together the four of us stood facing the door, ready for whatever unknown threat lay ahead. No matter what was to come, I knew my friends had my back.  And that was all I needed to know.
