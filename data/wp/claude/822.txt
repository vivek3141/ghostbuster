Death has never really bothered you. You've always accepted it as a natural and inevitable part of life. But when you walked out of your apartment this morning to see everyone lying dead where they were once thriving, you feel a little worried.  

The usual sounds of the city were absent. No honking taxis, no chattering pedestrians, no rumbling trains. Just an eerie, ominous silence.

You notice your neighbor, old Mrs. Jenkins, slumped over in her flower bed, the prized orchids she had been tending to for decades at her side. The barista who knew your coffee order by heart was collapsed inside the cafe, surrounded by the now cold and bitter drinks she had just prepared. Your coworkers were strewn about the office, some still at their desks, forever preserved in the act of furiously typing or chatting on the phone.  

A feeling of dread creeps into your veins as you wonder if you are the sole survivor of some catastrophic event. How had this happened so swiftly and silently while you slept? Why were you the only one left untouched? Questions and worries swirl in your mind as you walk down abandoned streets filled with stopped cars and vacant faces that used to smile, shout and sulk. 

You wander for hours in a haze of confusion and fear, searching in vain for any signs of life. But deep within the gnawing doubt, a small part of you remains numb. You have always known death comes for us all eventually. You just never imagined it would come so suddenly and completely, wiping the slate clean and leaving you alone as the sole relic of a world now faded to memory.  

A story of this length allows for setting the scene, describing some of the details and inner thoughts, building a bit of mystery and emotion, while still keeping it fairly concise. Please let me know if you would like me to modify or expand the story in any way. I aimed for a somewhat reflective and eerie tone to match the prompt.
