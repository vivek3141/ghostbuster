I tapped the rhythm of my latest cheating method against the desk. Two knocks, a pause, then three quick raps - that was the signal for the answers to the math test we were currently taking. Sure enough, a gentle cough followed by the rustle of papers from two rows over signaled my partner sliding the answer sheet onto the floor for me to grab.

As I leaned over to pick it up, I added two coughs - our code to indicate the plan had worked. We were part of an underground network of cheaters, helping each other through school any way we could. We had signals for tests, a system to swap homework and papers, a whole network of people who could provide excuses for absences or forge permission slips. So far we hadn't been caught, and we were set to sail through senior year on the efforts of our illicit study group.

After school, I headed to my part-time job. My cheater network extended there as well, one coworker clocking me in when I would be late, another swooping in to claim I did work that I never quite finished. I returned the favor when I could. We had an unspoken agreement - you scratch my back, I scratch yours. Our cheating was a team effort and a way of life. 

That night, an unusual message came through the encrypted chat app we used. “Need a fake obit, family emergency.” My heart pounded as I typed a response. “For who?”

“Me. Need to get out of town for a few days. Tell the school my grandma died or something.” It was Jake, one of the most active members of our group. 

I couldn’t believe what I was reading. Faking his own death to get a few days off from school was extreme, even for our cheating standards. But the code of honor held - we helped each other no matter what.  I agreed to pass along the false story, my stomach churning with nerves the whole time.

The next day an announcement came over the school speakers that Jake’s grandma had passed away and the school offered its condolences. I felt a mix of disbelief, unease, and a strange sense of pride that we had pulled this off.

Jake returned a week later with gifts from his “family emergency” trip. Everything went back to normal, but something had shifted. We were no longer just lazy students gaming the system - we had evolved to outright criminal plans and deception. The cheating no longer felt so harmless.

A few months later, Jake messaged me late at night in a panic. He needed another favor but couldn’t tell me over chat. We met in person where Jake revealed the truth - his cheating was spiraling out of control. He owed dangerous people money from gambling and was in deep trouble. He needed to fake his death again, this time for real, in order to escape. 

I stared in shock as Jake begged me for help carrying out a real, fraudulent death and cover up. This had gone too far - I refused to help. Our cheating network immediately crumbled without its leader.  Jake disappeared shortly after, presumed to have gone through with his plan alone.

The close call woke me up to the reality that one small act of cheating, multiplied, could spin out of control into a web of deception that threatened to trap us all. My cheating days were over - I had nearly become an accomplice to faking a death, and it was time to come clean before I got caught up in something even worse. Our cheating had evolved into something sinister, and the only way out was to stop entirely. My cheating network collapsed, but I was finally free of the burden of keeping up the charade.
