The Cloud Catcher

by Your AI Assistant

Jael peered over the edge of the airship, staring down at the billowing cumulus cloud below. It looked soft and inviting, like a massive sea of cotton balls. But she knew the dangers that lurked within its misty depths. 

As a cloud catcher, it was Jael's job to descend into clouds like this one, harvest the magical energy within, and transport it back to the surface. It was difficult, dangerous work, but it powered the world. Everything from the lights in people's homes to the engines in automobiles ran on the energy harvested from clouds.

Jael took a deep breath and steadied her nerves. Her leather safety suit creaked as she leaned over the rail. This was a big cloud, and a promising catch, but bigger clouds meant bigger storms. And bigger storms meant more opportunities for things to go wrong.

But she had a job to do. Jael hit the release on her tether, the only thing attaching her to the airship, and pushed off. She slid down the tether, wind whipping at her suit as she descended into the cloud. Within seconds, mist enveloped her. She slowed her descent and looked around.

A faint glow permeated the cloud, pulsing with energy. She took out her harvesting rods, two metal batons with capacitors at one end to store the energy. She rubbed them together, activating them, and they began to glow as they absorbed energy from the cloud.

Bolts of lightning crackled around her, and thunder rumbled. The storm was building. She worked as quickly as she could, absorbing energy and transferring it to the storage packs on her back. But the cloud churned violently. A lightning bolt struck her tether, and for a second the world lit up in a blinding flash. 

The tether went slack. Jael's stomach dropped as she started free falling. She was disconnected from the airship, plummeting towards the ground thousands of feet below.

She scrambled to come up with a plan. The cloud was too thick and turbulent to fly her emergency glider. But she still had momentum carrying her downâ€”she could use that. 

Jael spread her arms and legs, increasing her drag, and angled her body to steer towards the edge of the cloud. After a few tense seconds of free fall, she emerged from the bottom of the cloud, spotting the wheat fields far below. She immediately deployed her glider, grabbing the handles to steer as the fabric billowed open above her.

With a hard bank, she turned upwards and spotted her airship. They had seen her emerge from the cloud and were lowering a rescue tether. She glided over and grabbed on, activating the wench to pull her up to safety. 

As her crewmates hoisted her aboard, she noticed the storage packs on her back were smashed and empty. The entire harvest had been lost in the fall. But as she emerged from the cloud, heart pounding, she realized that no amount of magical energy or money was worth her life. She was done with cloud catching after today. There were better, safer ways to power the world, and she was going to find them.
