Chaos erupted as the news spread through the White House - the President had been shot. Agents swarmed heading to George Washington University Hospital, where Reagan had been taken.

Vice President George H.W. Bush was in flight over Texas when the call came through. His plane immediately turned around, racing back to Washington.

At the hospital, doctors worked frantically in the ER trying to stabilize the President. But the wound from the .22 caliber bullet was too severe.  Reagan's blood pressure dropped dangerously low and despite transfusions and surgery, they could not stop the internal bleeding. 

Nancy Reagan rushed to the hospital, her shock turning to grief as she realized her beloved "Ronnie" would not survive. She sat by his side, holding his hand, as the President slipped away less than two hours after the shooting.

At 7:22 pm, Press Secretary James Brady somberly stepped before the microphones. "It is with great sadness that I announce the passing of the 40th President of the United States, Ronald Wilson Reagan. The President died at George Washington University Hospital after being shot in an assassination attempt..." 

He could not continue as a gasp went up from the press corps. Many journalists broke into tears, disbelief and shock on their faces.

Brady went on to say there would be a period of national mourning. The stock market would be closed. Details on the state funeral would be forthcoming. For now, the government was focused on ensuring a smooth transition of power to President Bush.

Around the nation and world, people gathered in tearful vigils as broadcasts replayed the stunning news. Reagan had survived an assassination attempt just 69 days into his presidency, only to now succumb to an attack that shook the nation to its core. 

In the span of a few hours, the course of history had shifted in ways that would take years to fully comprehend. The nation mourned the loss of the Great Communicator, whose buoyant optimism had lifted the country's spirit. Gone too soon, Reagan's legacy as the savior of the conservative movement would cement his place as an icon who shaped America's political destiny in the dawning days of the 1980s.
