Your girlfriend Lucy has never truly gotten over the fact that you met her while on a date with another girl at the coffee shop. Ever since, she has looked to get revenge in small, petty ways. She convinces your boss to pass you over for a promotion. You end up taking a new job  with a higher salary. 

She cancels your reservation at your favorite restaurant. You discover  an even better restaurant you never knew about. Each attempt to make you suffer in some way ends up improving your life.

Today, filled with love and blissfully unaware of her sabotage attempts, you propose to Lucy at your special spot in the park under an old elm tree. She can barely contain her urge to spoil the moment but the presence of others keeps her in check.

As you slip the ring on her finger, her vindictive gears are already turning on how to turn this moment into your worst nightmare. She calls the new restaurant and cancels your reservation for an engagement dinner, certain this will upset you. When you arrive, the staff feel so guilty about the mistake that they treat you to a lavish meal on the house.  

Her half-hearted "yes" at the proposal and her barely hidden glee at small inconveniences you face only make you shake your head and chuckle at the odd quirks you have come to accept in the woman you love. Her weapons of choice to ruin your bliss have only made you happier than ever at the thought of this life with her by your side. Constantly trying and hilariously failing to foil your joy, she has become your sweet, conniving, unknowing good luck charm.
