This was officially the worst day of my life. First the boss calls me in, says "we're letting you go." No warning, no explanation. Then I get home early to find my girlfriend hastily straightening her clothes and a strange car pulling away. I don't even want to think about that.  

To round out this perfect day, I remember my rent was due last week and I have no way to pay the landlord. And the final insult? I reach into the fridge for a beer, the only thing that could make this day bearable, and find that I'm completely out.

As I slump into my couch wondering how much worse this day could possibly get, I notice an unread email on my phone titled "Would you like to change the difficulty? Current setting: Very Hard." At this point I'm beyond caring if this is some kind of scam or Spam. I tap to open the email.

"Yes, for the love of all that is good, please change the difficulty setting from 'Very Hard' to something, anything else," I reply, not expecting an actual response. 

To my utter amazement I get an immediate auto-response: "Difficulty setting changed to 'Easy.' Please allow 24 hours for changes to take effect. Things will start looking up soon!"

I stare at my phone stunned. I have no idea what just happened but at this point, I'll take any reprieve I can get, even if it is just the universe finally cutting me some slack. Things have to get better from here, right?
