The pounding rain and howling wind had finally subsided after hours of being battered by the tremendous storm. But now in the eerie calm, you realized you were hopelessly lost at sea. Your small sailing boat had been pushed miles off course, no land in sight.
Supplies were running low, especially fresh water. You had rationed the water over the last few days but even the strict limits you had imposed were not enough. The situation was looking dire as the relentless sun beat down from the clear sky. You knew dehydration would set in soon without finding more water.

As you scanned the empty horizon in all directions, despair started to wash over you in waves. How would you ever navigate back? How long could you possibly last out here without more supplies? You started to calculate worst case scenarios in your mind, each one bleaker than the last.

Then off the port bow you spotted something. It looked like it could be debris from your boat or another ship. But no, it was moving. It was the unmistakable profile of a person swimming!

Your heart leaped as you rushed to the side of the boat, waving your arms and shouting "Ahoy, over here!" The figure started swimming toward you with strong, purposeful strokes. As he got closer, you could see it was a man, a survivor maybe from another ship or could he have been in a life raft before it fell apart? 

When he reached your boat, you scrambled to throw him a rope and help haul him up and over the side. He collapsed on the deck, breathing heavily. You rushed to get him some of the precious remaining fresh water.

After a few gulps and catching his breath, he looked up at you. "Thank the Lord you came along!" he exclaimed.  "I was shipwrecked three days ago and have been drifting and swimming trying to find any signs of life."

You could hardly believe your luck. Now there were two of you, much better odds to navigate and signal for help from rescue ships or find land. You smiled at the stranger, feeling a rush of gratitude and a spark of hope once again. Together, you just might make it out of this alive. "I'm mighty glad you spotted my boat, sir. The name's Tom, Tom Smith" 

He returned your smile, "Pleasure to meet you Tom, name's William Turner."

You were lost at sea no more. William's unexpected arrival was like a gift, the chance at survival and making it home. The horizon seemed brighter already. You had a shipmate in this ordeal, and that made all the difference. The dire situation you only just been contemplating had taken a turn for the better. As long as you had each other, you thought, you could weather any storm. Fortune had smiled upon you today.
