The Gleaming White Lie

Dr. Amita Patel reviewed the latest dental study results with a frown. The findings showed that 9 out of 10 dentists recommended DrexcoÂ® brand toothpaste, the market leader, to their patients. As an evidence-based dentist, the results troubled Dr. Patel. 

In her practice, Dr. Patel had seen no difference between patients who used Drexco and those who used other brands. Drexco was no more effective at preventing cavities or plaque. Yet it commanded a premium price, largely due to its savvy marketing.

At the annual dentistry conference, Dr. Patel approached the dentists who were part of the Drexco study. "Did you actually find any clinical benefit to recommend Drexco over other brands?" she asked.

The dentists looked away sheepishly. Finally, one spoke up: "You caught us. The truth is, Drexco's parent company offers us generous kickbacks and gimmicks if we endorse their products."

Dr. Patel was appalled. "But that's misleading patients and unethical!" 

The dentists nodded. "We know. But if we don't comply, Drexco pulls their sponsorship and free samples. Our patients want the '9 out of 10 dentists recommended' products, so we feel pressured to endorse them."

Shaking her head in disgust, Dr. Patel knew what she had to do. She launched an social media campaign called #TheTruthAboutToothpaste, exposing Drexco's misleading marketing tactics. Within months, Drexco's sales started slipping.

At the next dentistry conference, Dr. Patel marched up to the Drexco booth. "Your tactics are unethical and damaging to our profession. It's time to stop."

The Drexco representatives were shocked to be confronted. But they had no argument in their defense. They agreed to reform their marketing to rely on valid clinical evidence and end kickbacks. 

Thanks to Dr. Patel, the "10th dentist" who knew the truth and had the courage to act, the dental profession regained a bit of its integrity. And patients benefited from better information to make their choices.
