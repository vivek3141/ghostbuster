The Sweet Hereafter 

Jenny curled up in the massive four-poster bed, the silk sheets caressing her skin. She stretched out and pressed a button to summon her attendant.

Moments later, there was a quiet knock at the ornate wooden door. "Come in," Jenny called out.

Her attendant, Charles, entered with a warm smile. "How may I be of service, madam?"

"I'm feeling peckish, Charles. Can you bring me something sweet?"

"Of course, right away." Charles bowed and exited the room.

Jenny sighed contentedly, gazing around her lavish chambers. Six months ago, she never could have imagined a place like this. But now she was here, in her own personal heaven, where she wanted for nothing.

Her heaven was a reflection of how she had died. Jenny had lived with Type 1 diabetes since she was a little girl, and no matter how carefully she managed it, her body eventually started to fail. Her kidneys first, then her eyesight deteriorated. By the time she passed at the age of 67, she had been on dialysis for years and nearly blind. 

In her final days, Jenny had yearned for something sweet to taste again, as her rigid diet allowed for no sugar. She dreamed of indulging in chocolate, cake, candy—anything delicious and forbidden.

When she opened her eyes in this afterlife, she found herself in a world where sugary treats were unlimited and had no consequences. Her youthful body was restored, as was her vision. And Charles, her attentive attendant, brought her anything her heart desired with a simple request.

A moment later, Charles returned carrying a silver tray filled with puffy pastries, petit fours, truffles, and other tantalizing sweets. "Your selection, madam," he said, placing the tray on her lap.

Jenny breathed in the intoxicating aroma of chocolate and felt her mouth water. "Oh, Charles, you've outdone yourself! This looks absolutely scrumptious."

"Only the best for you, madam," Charles said with a bow. 

As Charles left the room, Jenny selected a plump strawberry macaron and bit into it, savoring the burst of sweet strawberry cream in her mouth. She moaned in pleasure and reached for a coffee-infused truffle, the rich bitterness melting on her tongue.

With each delectable bite, she was transported back to happy memories of enjoying sweets as a little girl with her parents and sister. Before diabetes had dominated her life and diet. Here, those bittersweet memories were replaced with the unbridled joy of indulgence without limits or consequences. 

Jenny knew her heaven wasn't for everyone. But after decades of denying herself even the simplest of pleasures, she was now living—and eating—in a bliss tailored perfectly for her. For Jenny, heaven was the sweet hereafter she had always dreamed of but never thought she'd taste again. And with Charles at her beck and call, it was paradise indeed.
