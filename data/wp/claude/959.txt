The candlelight flickered across Emma's face as she gazed into Mark's eyes. Their hands intertwined across the table, a tingle of electricity passing between them. 

Mark couldn't believe his luck. How did he end up across from this stunning, funny woman on their third date? His heart swelled as Emma threw back her head and laughed at his silly joke.

When dessert arrived, Mark watched in delight as Emma scooped up a spoonful of chocolate mousse and closed her eyes in pleasure. A bit of chocolate clung to her lip, and Mark's breath caught in his throat. 

Emma's eyes opened and locked onto his. She slowly, sensually ran her tongue along her lip, gathering the stray chocolate. Mark swallowed hard, his body tense with longing. 

The air crackled between them. Emma leaned forward slightly, eyes heavy-lidded, and held out her spoon, offering him a taste of the mousse. Hardly daring to breathe, Mark parted his lips. Emma slipped the spoon into his mouth, the chocolate melting on his tongue. 

Time seemed to stop. The intimacy of that moment hung between them, full of promise. They both knew that for them, sharing the sweetness of chocolate mousse was as tender and arousing as the softest, deepest kiss. Their romance had truly begun.
