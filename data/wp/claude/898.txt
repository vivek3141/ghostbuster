The sun rose over the hills, its golden light illuminating the verdant valley below. I stepped out onto the porch of my little stone cottage and breathed in the morning air, scented with pine needles and damp earth.  Four hundred years. Had it really been that long?

My mind drifted back through the centuries. So much had changed in the world outside this valley, my secluded home for so many decades. Kingdoms had risen and crumbled. Technologies had reshaped how people lived and worked. ideologies had swept the world, promising utopia but often delivering little but misery. 

And yet in this place, time seemed to move more slowly. The mountain peaks still jutted proudly into the azure sky. The river still burbled softly as it meandered through the glen. The birds still awoke with the dawn and filled the air with their song. I felt at once out of time yet deeply rooted, anchored to this land.

Few who had known me at the beginning remained. My childhood friends, my own family - all were long since turned to dust. I had watched generation after generation grow old and pass, like leaves falling from the trees in the autumn. Mortal lives flickered and faded before my ageless eyes. 

There were times this filled me with sorrow, a loneliness deeper than words. But I also found a kind of solace in the rhythm of it, the bittersweet beauty of life's fleeting moments. People come and go, but life goes on. The world keeps turning.

On this morning, though, I did not wish to dwell on what I had lost. I wanted to be grateful for all I had gained. For the wisdom I had accrued, hard-earned, over so many years of joys and sorrows, triumphs and failures. For the way I had learned to appreciate life's simplest pleasures - a golden sunrise, a child's laugh, the changing of the seasons. For the capacity to find meaning even in the mundane.

Four hundred years was both a blink of an eye and an eternity. I smiled to myself at the paradox. However long I had left, I knew this: every day was a gift. And this morning, as birds sang out from the treetops and a new day awakened, I was ready to receive it open-handed and with gratitude. My time on this earth may be unending, but living *well* - that was something I had to choose each and every day. And so I chose to live well on this, my four hundredth birthday, and to embrace with joy each new dawn I was given.  Let time pass - I would make the moments matter.
