The alarm blared as the first rays of sunlight peeked through the curtains. I groaned and rolled over, slapping the snooze button. Five more minutes of sleep, that's all I wanted. 

My name is Mark and I'm a senior accountant at a mid-sized firm in the city. It was time to start the daily grind. I dragged myself out of bed and into the shower, hoping the hot water would wash away the lingering fatigue.

20 minutes later I was dressed in my usual suit and tie and contemplating what to have for breakfast. I opted for a protein shake and a granola barâ€”no time for anything more elaborate. The traffic into downtown was its typical nightmare and I was concerned I might be late for my first meeting as I settled into my seat on the train.  

At the office, my assistant Jenny greeted me with my schedule for the day and a warm cup of coffee. I gave her a grateful smile. What did I do to deserve such a wonderful assistant? 

The morning flew by in a blur of meetings, phone calls, and too much paperwork. Before I knew it, it was lunchtime. I didn't have any client lunches on the calendar today so I took the opportunity to go for a quick walk around the block to get some exercise and fresh air. The sun felt pleasant on my face, a welcome change from the recycled air of the corporate office building.

After lunch, I spent a few hours reviewing tax returns and making notes for some upcoming audits. Tedious but important work. By 6 pm my eyes felt tired and dry. I decided to call it a day even though I still had a few things left on my to-do list. They would have to wait until tomorrow. 

On my commute home, I thought about what to make for dinner. I wasn't in the mood to cook anything complex. An omelette with cheese and vegetables would do the trick. A few minutes of chopping and whisking eggs and dinner was ready. I ate while watching the evening news and catching up on a few shows I had recorded.  

The rest of the evening was uneventful. I did a load of laundry, read a book to unwind, and was in bed by 10 pm. My life wasn't the most thrilling, but it was dependable and comfortable. As I drifted off to sleep, the alarm looming again in just 7 short hours, I reminded myself that I had a good job, a nice home, and stability. For now, that was enough. But part of me yearned for something more in my predictable world. Something to stir up the routine I had settled into. I wasn't sure what that might be, only that I was ready for a change of pace. The possibilities lingered in my mind as I succumbed at last to slumber.
