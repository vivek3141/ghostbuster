The plane cruised at 30,000 feet as I gripped the armrests, knuckles turning white. My breath came in short gasps as I broke out in a cold sweat. I had done it. I earned the “One Million Miles High” achievement, flying over one million miles in my lifetime according to the airline’s rewards program. 

The notification popped up on the seatback screen in front of me a few minutes after takeoff from London to New York. One million miles. A dizzying number representing hundreds of flights, airports, delays, cramped seats, tiny bags of pretzels, microwave pasta meals, turbulence, sunrises and sunsets seen through oval windows. An entire life lived in increments of a few hours strapped into a metal tube jetting across land and sea.

The achievement unlocked a unique bonus, the ability to access an exclusive lounge with complimentary massages, showers, premium alcohol and gourmet meals. No more jostling for charging outlets at the crowded gate. No more sitting on the floor outside the lavatory, knees pulled up, waiting for my zone to board. The comfort and luxury I had long craved while traveling were now within my grasp.

But in that moment, suspended six miles high over the Atlantic, the enormity of one million miles hit me. One million moments away from friends and family and the familiar comforts of home. One million miles of adventure, culture and natural wonders to experience. One million miles that shaped me into the person I am today. The achievement was bittersweet, a reminder of how much life had transpired during those miles. I took a deep breath and let the tears flow, safe in knowing there were many more miles yet to come.
