The Magic Coin 

Jenny was down to her last few dollars. Rent was due in a week and her meager paycheck from the diner wasn't going to cover it. As she walked home, she noticed a strange old coin on the sidewalk, dull silver and slightly larger than a quarter. She picked it up and slipped it into her pocket, thinking little of it.

When she got home, she pulled the coin from her pocket and examined it. On one side was engraved: "For those in need, I shall provide. But once self-reliance has been supplied, pass me onto another by your side." Strange, she thought. She dropped the coin into a jar of spare change and forgot about it.

A few days later, Jenny's landlord reminded her that rent was coming up. To her surprise, when she checked her change jar, it contained exactly enough to cover the rent. She paid on time, relieved. 

Over the next weeks, whenever Jenny needed money - for groceries, gas, bills - she found just enough in the jar. She realized the strange coin seemed to be supplying what she needed. At first, she thought it was too good to be true. But the coin never failed her.

Within a couple months, business picked up at the diner and Jenny's pay increased. She no longer struggled and the coin's deposits dwindled. She remembered the inscription and knew it was time to pass it on.

Jenny gave the coin to a homeless woman she often saw near the diner. "This is a magic coin," Jenny said. "It will provide you funds until you get back on your feet. Then pass it to someone else in need." The woman was incredulous but took the coin.

A month later, the woman returned. "You were right about the coin, it's helped me turn my life around." She passed the coin back to Jenny. "Now it's time for me to help someone else."

Jenny knew the coin had found another person in need. Its magic would help again. She set off to find the coin's next recipient so it could continue its purpose.
