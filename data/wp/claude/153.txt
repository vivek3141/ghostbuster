The clock read 22:58. My heart raced as I put on my coat and headed out into the chilly night air. I walked briskly through the empty streets, my senses on high alert.

23:00 came and went as I approached the abandoned warehouse. This was the place, no doubt about it. But why the cryptic message? And who sent it?

I slid open the rusty side door and stepped in. The place seemed empty. "Hello?" I called out. No response. 

Suddenly, the door slammed shut behind me. I spun around, but it was too dark to see anything. I pounded on the door, but it wouldn't budge.

A single light flickered on, revealing a figure standing across the room. It was a woman in a trench coat and fedora, her face obscured. She snapped her fingers and the walls started closing in around me. It was a trap.

As I scrambled to find an escape, the woman walked over and at last removed her hat. I gasped—it was my friend Jenny, grinning from ear to ear. "Happy birthday!" she exclaimed. The walls retracted, revealing all my friends and family. The mysterious message, the abandoned warehouse—it had all been an elaborate ruse for a surprise party. I had to hand it to them. This was one birthday I would never forget.
