I never thought I'd be a mother, let alone to a clone of myself. But when CloneTech announced they had perfected human cloning, offering clones as surrogate children for infertile or single women, I was intrigued. I had always wanted a daughter, and this seemed like the perfect opportunity. 

After going through the extensive screening and legal procedures, I was implanted with my own cloned embryo. Nine months later, Elizabeth was born. She looked exactly like my baby pictures, down to the little birthmark on her left ankle. But as she started to grow up, I began noticing little similarities that made me increasingly uneasy.

Today I was showing Elizabeth some old family photo albums, pointing out relatives she would never meet. When I came across a photo of my sister Amy at age eight, I froze. The resemblance was uncanny. They had the exact same unruly curls, the same dimpled smile, the same lanky limbness of a child approaching adolescence. 

Elizabeth peered at the photo in fascination. "That looks like it could be me!" she exclaimed. "If you cut my hair and gave me those funny old clothes." 

I forced a smile, unsettled. How had I never noticed before how much Amy and I looked alike at that age? We were only two years apart, and people were always mixing us up as kids. I supposed I had been too close to see the resemblance objectively. But now, the similarities were glaring.  

The thought drifted into my mind unbidden: Did CloneTech use my sister's DNA by accident instead of mine? They did have both our profiles on file, after eligibility testing. It seemed impossible with all their safeguards, yet I couldn't shake the suspicion.

I spent the next few days observing Elizabeth closely and comparing her mannerisms, facial expressions and behaviors to both my memories of myself as a child, and to Amy. The similarities to Amy were striking. Elizabeth even made some of the same corny jokes and silly puns Amy and I laughed over as kids. 

By the end of the week, I was certain of the terrible mistake that had been made. I contacted CloneTech, demanding they run a DNA test on Elizabeth to confirm she was cloned from me and not my sister. They tried to reassure me that was impossible, but ultimately had to concede to the test to maintain my business and avoid a lawsuit.

The test results came back irrefutable. Elizabeth was not my clone. She was Amy's, implanted in me and raised as my own daughter these past eight years. I was left grappling with the knowledge that I had been given the child of my dreams, just not quite as intended. But she was still my Elizabeth, the little girl I had nurtured and loved her whole life. And I swore I would keep her safe and cherished, as any mother would. After all, she was still my family. My gift from Amy. And always would be.
