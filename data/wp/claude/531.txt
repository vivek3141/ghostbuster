The silence was deafening. I slowly opened my eyes, unsure of what horrors might greet me. But there was nothing. Just an eerie silence and a landscape of rubble stretching in all directions.

I was in the remains of Times Square, but there were no bright lights or bustling crowds. Only the mangled remnants of neon signs and torched, hollowed out buildings. I coughed as I inhaled the thick, acrid dust polluting the air. 

Somehow I had survived, but there wasn't another soul to be found. I wandered the abandoned streets in a daze, unable to comprehend the scale of the catastrophe that had unfolded. What unfathomable series of events could have led to this? I called out but my hoarse cries were met with no response. There wasn't even the faint sound of a bird chirping or a rat scurrying. Complete, impenetrable silence.

A deep panic rose within me. I started sprinting aimlessly, my breath ragged, as my eyes scanned in vain for any sign of the life that had pulsed through these streets just days earlier. But there was only death and debris.

Overwhelmed by grief and fear, I stumbled and fell. At that moment something caught my eye â€“ a glint of light reflecting off a shard of glass, the only object left jutting out intact and unscathed. I reached out to grab it, longing to hold onto something familiar, something real. 

As my fingers clutched the jagged edge, the glass gave way. I watched in stunned disbelief as the glass slid into my wrist, spurting blood. The pain registered as a dull ache. I became lightheaded and slumped to the ground, the lone survivor in a graveyard of humanity. The glass had sliced straight through my radial artery. 

Within minutes my blood had drained, soaking into the dusty concrete around me. And so I died alone on that silent, dead street, surrounded by the ruins of civilization - the last figure in a barren, unpeopled world. My journey had come to an end in the most pathetic, undignified way, not with a bang but with a careless slip on a broken shard of glass. The ultimate grim irony and punchline in a cruel, unforgiving cosmic joke.
