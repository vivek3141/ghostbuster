The full moon shone brightly as I walked through the dark forest. I knew I shouldn't have taken this shortcut, but I was in a hurry to get home. 

A sudden rustling of leaves startled me. I turned around and came face to face with a menacing werewolf, drool dripping from its sharp fangs. Before I could react, it lunged at me and bit my arm. I screamed in terror and pain. The werewolf let out a bone-chilling howl and ran off into the night.

Clutching my bleeding arm, I stumbled out of the forest. But my nightmare was not over. A zombie emerged from the shadows, his undead eyes glowing with a sinister hunger. He grabbed me with his rotting hands, overpowering the scent of decay. I tried to break free but he dug his teeth into my neck. Then he simply let go and wandered off.

Barely able to stand, I dragged myself down the empty street. A dark figure swooped down from the sky - a vampire. He hissed, baring a pair of razor-sharp fangs, and bit into my wrist. My blood trickled down my arm as he flew away into the night.  

Somehow I made it home, my head spinning with fever and confusion. What was happening to me? I had been bitten by three supernatural creatures in one night. At once, an unbearable pain shot through my body as my transformation began.

My canine teeth grew into fangs and claws protruded from my fingertips. Fur sprouted all over my body as my limbs twisted and reformed into a wolf-like shape. I let out an anguished howl.

But my metamorphosis did not stop there. My wolfish features melted away, replaced by a insatiable hunger for flesh and brains. An unnatural strength and agility filled my reanimated corpse. I had become a zombie.

Yet even that was not the end. A strange craving for blood overtook me. My pale skin burned in the soft light and fangs descended from my gums once more. I had turned into a vampire as well.

The transformations left me disoriented and confused. What was I? Werewolf, zombie or vampire? I was caught between three curses, trapped in a perpetual cycle of transformations I could not control. The full moon rose again, and my endless nightmare began anew.
