The Old Radio

The old radio sat on the shelf, covered in dust. It had belonged to my grandfather, a relic from another era. I never thought much of it. 

One night, unable to sleep, I went downstairs to get a glass of water. As I passed the radio, I suddenly had the urge to turn it on. I wiped off the dust and clicked the power button. At first, there was only static. 

Then, faintly, I heard music. A woman's voice, soft and melodic. Strange, I thought, how could this radio pick up any station? It was ancient.

I turned the tuning dial, and the music vanished. Disappointed, I turned the dial back. The music returned, louder now. But it sounded strange, otherworldly. I looked at the radio in wonder. What kind of signal was this?

Suddenly, the woman began to sing words I couldn't understand. Her voice was haunting and beautiful. Then, she switched to English:

"Child of the present, messenger of the future, 
You have opened the window to the past.
What was once gone is alive once more. 
Tales and tunes of old you have amassed.‚Äù

I sat motionless, enthralled. The song ended in a hum, leaving me in silence. I stared at the radio, shadows flickering on the shelf. In that moment, the ordinary became extraordinary. I had discovered a portal to another time. I kept the portal open all through the night, listening in awe to sounds from long ago.
