I stared at the doctor in disbelief. Three days? After a year of mentally preparing for the inevitability of losing my eyesight, three days felt horrifyingly short. 

I walked out of the office in a daze. My vision was already cloudy and blurred, but now each glimpse of beauty felt painfully fleeting. I rushed home and grabbed my camera, determined to absorb as much as I could in the little time I had left.

The next morning, I woke up before dawn and went to the beach. As the sun peeked above the horizon, I photographed the golden light dancing on the waves. The fiery orange and red hues blinded me for a moment, but I took photo after photo, trying to memorize the scene with my eyes and capture it with my camera.

In the afternoon, I visited a botanical garden, photographing vibrant flowers and intricately patterned leaves up close. I ran my fingers over the smooth petals and jagged edges of the foliage, closing my eyes to focus on the textures and scents. 

On the final day, I spent hours photographing the city from my roof, zooming in on people walking their dogs, riding bikes, and going about their daily lives. I knew I would miss observing these ordinary details - a couple holding hands, a child laughing without restraint. I stayed on the roof until long after the sun had set and the streets had emptied, taking a photo of my last sunset through a blur of tears.

The next morning, I awoke to darkness. After a moment of panic and disorientation, I steadied my breathing. My sight was gone, but I had used my last days wisely, preserving memories that I could revisit again and again in my mind's eye and through the photos I had taken. Though vision had left me, the beauty of the world remained. I smiled into the darkness, embraced by the bittersweet comfort of my last sunsets and the memory of flowers not yet faded.
