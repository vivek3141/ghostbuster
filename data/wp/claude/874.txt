The Awakening

Jenny woke with a strange tingling sensation in her right arm. She opened her eyes and was shocked to see a glowing number 7 and the word "Mage" imprinted on her skin. It looked like a tattoo, but she had never gotten a tattoo in her life.

She stumbled out of bed and went to the bathroom to splash water on her face. The markings were still there. This had to be some sort of strange dream. She walked downstairs where her family was already up for breakfast. 

"Jenny, did you get a tattoo?" her mother asked, concerned. She held up her own arm, revealing the number 2 and the word "Healer".

Jenny's father and brother also had markings. Her father, a 6 and "Warrior". Her brother, a 4 and "Rogue".

They turned on the news and every channel was reporting the same strange phenomenon. Overnight, every person on the planet had woken up with a number between 1 to 10 and a "class" on their arm. No one had any idea how or why this had happened. Social media was abuzz with speculation and panic.

A presidential alert flashed on their phones, ordering all citizens to remain in their homes until further notice. But within minutes, Jenny's phone lit up with messages in a group chat. The other members all appeared to have the designation "Mage" as well, people she didn't even know. They were as confused as she was, but they could sense a connection between them.

A loud bang shook the house as a tree fell over in their yard. Through the window, Jenny saw old Ms. Abernathy from down the street, gesturing wildly as objects floated around her. She had been marked as a Level 9 Mage. Jenny's hands grew hot, and she instinctively knew if she focused she could do magic as well.  

 More noises outside, yells and screams. The news showed people all over discovering powers and abilities related to their new markings. Some were using them for good, helping others. But some were causing chaos and violence. The world had descended into madness. 

The Mages communicated through their group chat, organizing themselves. They had a mix of fire, water, earth and wind magic. If they worked together, they could help contain the disorder.

Jenny and her family huddled in the living room, cut off from the outside world. "We have to do something," her father said, clutching his war hammer. "We can't sit by and do nothing."

Jenny's hands ignited with flame. "Dad's right. Let's go help."

Her brother nodded, daggers at the ready.  Jenny's mother gathered her healing supplies. They all looked at each other, scared but determined, and headed out into the fray. The Awakening had arrived, and nothing would ever be the same again.
