The old warehouse loomed before Jack, holding untold secrets behind its rusty metal door. His father had disappeared inside years ago, never to emerge. The only clue Jack had was his father's awful sense of humor and his favorite corny joke. 

Jack took a deep breath and pulled open the creaky door. Dim light filtered in through grimy windows, illuminating a maze of boxes and crates. 

"Dad?" Jack's voice echoed in the vast space. No response. 

He wandered the aisles, his heart pounding. He ran his hands over the dusty boxes, looking for any clues. Why did you leave, Dad? What were you hiding?

At the back of the warehouse, one box caught his eye. Scrawled across the top in his father's handwriting was "Left Beef". 

Jack gasped. Could this be a clue? He tore open the box to find several packages of meat, labeled "Left Beef" in the same familiar scrawl. 

His heart sank as realization dawned. All those years ago, his dad told that stupid joke, "What do you call cheese that isn't yours? Nacho cheese!" Jack groaned, his hopes dashed. 

Just then, he heard a creak behind him. He turned to see his father step out from the shadows, a grin on his face. "I never could resist an awful pun. Did you get it, son?"

Jack stood in stunned silence. His dad was alive, still joking after all these years. He shook his head, a smile breaking through. 

"Welcome back, Dad."

His father embraced him in a hug. "I've been waiting a long time for you to come find me. I'm so sorry I left...I just needed the time to figure some things out. But I never stopped thinking of you, son."

They stood together, all those lost years and bad jokes between them, finally reunited at long last in that old abandoned warehouse full of left beef. Some jokes are utterly unforgettable.
