George wiped the sweat off his brow as he admired the makeshift contraption in front of him. After weeks of tinkering in his garage workshop, his crazy invention was finally complete. 

His neighbor and best friend, Tom, had been skeptical from the start. "A peanut butter-powered rocket car?" he had exclaimed when George first described his idea. "That will never work, you nutty professor!"

But George was determined to prove him wrong. Peanut butter contained oils and fats that could theoretically power an engine, even if the science was unconventional. George tweaked and experimented, enduring several small explosions and failures along the way, but remained undeterred.

This morning, he called Tom over to unveil the final product. Tom walked into the garage, his jaw dropping in a mixture of disbelief and  awe. "You actually built it," he said shaking his head. The vehicle looked like something out of a cartoon, all strange angles and tubes, with a giant peanut butter vat powering the back wheels.

"Hop in!" yelled George as he slid into the driver's seat, unable to contain his excitement. Tom cautiously took the passenger seat. 

"Hit it!" George flipped the switch and the contraption rumbled and shook, peanut butter flowing through the tubes igniting the engine. They burst out of the garage at an alarming speed, orange flame and black smoke billowing from the exhaust pipes. 

"I told you it would work!" exclaimed George over the deafening roar of the engine and Tom's screams of terror. They raced down the street at an improbable 50 miles per hour in the rickety rocket car, George cackling with glee at proving everyone wrong as Tom clung on for dear life, silently vowing never to doubt George's crazy inventions again.
