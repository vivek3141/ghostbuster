You pack a fresh bowl in your bong and spark it up, inhaling the aromatic smoke. As you exhale and sink into your couch, a puff of smoke emerges from the bong, coalescing into a little figure floating in mid-air. 

"Whoa, I must be really high," you mutter. The smoke genie giggles.

"Yes, and so am I! I am the genie of your bong, here to grant you three wishes in our shared state of stoney bliss."

Your eyes widen. "For real?"

"For real, dude. Now make your first wish before this high wears off!" The genie starts making waves with his smoky arms, drifting around the room.

You ponder, gazing at your snack-filled coffee table. "I wish for an infinite supply of Doritos." You grab a chip and crunch in anticipation. 

"Granted!" The genie snaps his fingers, and a cascade of Dorito bags rains from the ceiling, piling up around you. The genie floats down, grabs a bag and munches a few chips. 

"These are most delicious, oh snack-wisher! Now make another wish, if you please!"

You think hard, struggling through your foggy mind. What else could you want? As the genie swims lazily through the air, an idea arises.

"I wish to be able to fly and float around the room like you, little genie!" you declare. 

"Your wish is my command!" The genie circles you, trailing smoke. A tingling sensation fills your body. You tentatively push off from the couch and find yourself drifting up. "Whoa!"

You glide around the room, weaving between Dorito bags, as the genie claps his smoky hands in glee. "How magical this is!" he exclaims. You swoop by him, overjoyed at your new power of flight.

After a few more laps around the room, you float down to the couch, your third wish lingering in your newly flight-capable mind. What could possibly make this day better? You know the genie, and the answer, must soon disappear into smoke. You turn to your friend, ready to make one final wish.
