I blinked my eyes slowly, straining to keep them open. I could feel the heaviness in my eyelids, the grittiness of exhaustion. It had been 87 hours since I had last slept. Any normal person would have collapsed by now, given in to the desperate need for rest. But I couldn't sleep. If I did, she would die. 

I got up from my chair and paced around the small bedroom, the frayed carpet rough under my bare feet. My limbs felt like lead, every movement an immense effort. I splashed cold water on my face, the shock providing a brief respite from the fog in my brain. I took deep breaths, willing my mind to stay alert. I couldn't let my eyes close. I couldn't.

The photo of her on the nightstand caught my eyeâ€”her green eyes sparkling, her smile radiant. My baby sister. She had been gone for three days now but I could still hear her laughter, feel her tiny hand grasping my finger. If I fell asleep, I might never get to hold that hand again. I might lose her forever. The thought sent adrenaline coursing through my veins, momentarily reviving my foggy mind. 

I turned on all the lights in the small apartment, their glare harsh against my sensitive eyes. The television was on, the volume up high, an endless stream of infomercials and reality shows and sitcoms. Loud noises and bright lights, tools to combat the darkness and silence that tempted me to sleep. 

The clock read 4:17am. Dawn was still hours away. Hours of fighting against my body's deepest needs and desires. I splashed water on my face again, the shock not lasting as long this time. My eyes drooped and I snapped them open, my heart racing. I couldn't fall asleep. I wouldn't. I would stay awake as long as I needed to, for as many days as it took. I would bring my baby sister home. I took a deep breath and resumed pacing, blinking into the harsh apartment lights. The long night stretched before me, an eternity between now and dawn. But I would not sleep. I could not. A life depended on it. Her life. And for her, I would stay awake forever.
