The massive Zordons starship hovered high above Angel Grove. Zordon gazed out the main viewscreen at the city below, bright lights twinkling in the night. Somewhere down there were five humans who had been chosen to receive the power of the GalactiZords, to help defend their planet. But their leaders were fearful and paranoid of alien contact. 

Zordon turned to his trusted assistant, Alpha 5. "Alpha, have the GalactiZords been deployed around the city?"

"Affirmative, Zordon," Alpha replied. "The zords have taken up positions to monitor for threats, but remain cloaked to human technology."

"Good," Zordon said. He only wanted to help Earth join the Galactic Alliance, to share technology and knowledge that could end disease, war, poverty. But there were forces that stoked fear of outsiders. They had turned the city against the arriving aliens, spreading lies and propaganda. 

Zordon considered his options. He could decloak the zords, show their power and might, force the city leaders to listen. But that was not the way. Rule by fear led only to tyranny. There had to be another way.

Just then alarms blared through the ship. On the viewscreen, five fighter jets screamed through the sky, firing missiles that exploded against the energy shield over the city. The shield rippled but held, deflecting the blasts.

"They are attacking again," Alpha said. "Shields holding at ninety percent. The city remains unharmed."

"Keep monitoring," Zordon said. "Do not engage unless fired upon directly. I want no provocation." The leaders were fearful, but there were still reasonable voices among the people. Not all had turned against alien contact. He had to find a way to reach them.

Days passed with more flybys and missile launches, but Zordon waited and watched. Alpha searched broadcasts and discovered a growing countermovement to the official propaganda. There were rallies calling for open communication, for accepting help from the stars. 

"The time may be right," Zordon mused. He asked Alpha to carefully scan the city's youth for candidates with strong moral character and potential for partnership. Alpha's scans found five suitable candidates, and Zordon made preparations. If he could establish a connection, form a trust, there was hope.

In the dead of night, five teens were teleported from their beds onto the ship. As they woke and panicked, Zordon appeared before them in a soothing hologram.

"Do not be afraid," he said gently. "I mean you no harm. I have brought you here because you give me hope."

He told them the truth of why he had come to Earth, and of the political forces stirring up fear. The teens listened with open minds. Zordon could see the possibility in each of them.

"I know I ask much," he said, "but your people need help. I have the means, if you would be willing to build understanding between us."

The teens agreed. Zordon initiated the transfer of galactic technology and knowledge into their minds. Not weapons or force, but wisdom and powers that came responsibility. The responsibility to protect, to serve as ambassadors.

When the sun rose again, the five teens were returned home, their families none the wiser. But in each there dwelled a connection to something greater. The power and self confidence to stand up for what was right.

Over weeks they spread the truth through their circles, then organized rallies and used social media to share messages of hope and partnership. Meanwhile the city leaders escalated their attacks, but Zordon held back still. Force would not sway public opinion. Only the truth, spoken by their own people.

The movement grew rapidly. Many voiced support for communication with the alien visitors. The city leaders redoubled propaganda efforts, but their messages of fear and division fell on deaf ears.

Finally Zordon knew the time was right. He contacted the teens and asked them to gather supporters in the city center. When thousands had assembled, calling out for contact, Zordon decloaked the massive GalactiZords, who leaned down and extended open palms to the people.

A cheer rose up as the crowd rushed forward, no fear in their hearts. At long last, contact had been made. The age of partnership had begun. Zordon smiled, hope for the future of Earth dawned this day.
