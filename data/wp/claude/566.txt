The time machine has malfunctioned. I wasn't supposed to arrive to this time period. This was not the plan. I set the dials for Chicago, 1893, but my old time machine must have  a short circuit. When I stepped out of the machine, instead of the World's Fair, I was surrounded by unrecognizable buildings under brightly colored neon lights. The people rushing by me on the busy sidewalk were dressed in peculiar, futuristic styles. Where did it take me?

In a panic, I ducked into an alleyway and checked the time circuits. The year read "3256". Over 1,200 years into the future! This was a disaster. My time machine was meant for short jumps, not vast stretches into the deep future. I didn't have enough fuel or supplies for a return trip.  

I slumped against the cold metal hull of the time machine, my mind racing. How would I get home? I couldn't risk being seen - who knows how a person from the past might alter the course of history. I was trapped in a strange world, cut off from everything I knew. The future was not meant for me. All I wanted was to return to the familiar comforts of the present I had left behind. My time traveling days were over. I just wanted to go home.
