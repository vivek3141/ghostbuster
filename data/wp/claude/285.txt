The Truth Comes Out

Jenny was nervous as she walked up the front steps to her parent's house. She had been dreading this dinner for weeks. Her brother Mike was in town and her parents wanted the whole family together. The problem was that Jenny had been lying to them for over a year.

When Jenny first dropped out of college, she couldn't bear to tell her parents the truth. They had sacrificed so much to pay her tuition, and she knew they would be devastated. So Jenny lied and told them she was still attending classes. She fabricated stories about exams, papers, and new friends. Every time she talked to them, the lies built upon each other, a tower of deceit. 

Jenny took a deep breath and walked inside. Her family greeted her with smiles and hugs. As they sat down to dinner, Jenny's heart raced. Her brother started asking questions about school and her courses this semester. Jenny avoided direct answers and changed the subject.

After dessert, Jenny's parents exchanged a look. "We know the truth," her mother said gently. "We spoke with the school. Why did you feel you couldn't tell us?"

Jenny burst into tears. She told them everything, all the shame and fear that had caused her to lie. To her surprise, they understood. They were disappointed but told her they loved her no matter what. The lies were in the past. Jenny felt a rush of relief. The tower of deceit crumbled around her, leaving her free to start anew. The truth had finally set her free.
