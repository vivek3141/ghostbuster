The three Zygon observers had been studying the inhabitants of Sol 3 for many orbits now. They were fascinated by the diversity of cultures and beliefs among the humans, yet one aspect seemed largely consistent across societiesâ€”the notion of a singular deity that had created everything. 

After analyzing human religious texts, art, and rituals from around the globe, the lead observer, Gliitch, had formed a theory. "I believe the humans conceive of their God as a metaphorical clockmaker," he said to his peers.

The other observers were puzzled. "A clockmaker? What evidence leads you to this conclusion?" asked Cliick.

Gliitch elaboated, "The humans seem to believe that their God created the universe, wound it up like a clock, and set it in motion according to a fixed plan. They speak of the 'clockwork precision' of the heavens and a belief in a predetermined destiny or ultimate design. Their scriptures even state that their God is a 'watcher' and that the end of time itself will be heralded by a final chime of sorts."

Cliick and Zzoop considered this theory. The more they reviewed the data, the more the clockmaker metaphor seemed to fit. The humans attributed everything in existence, from the cycles of day and night to the seasons to the birth and death of all living things, to the machinations of an all-powerful creator and grand designer.  

"Fascinating," said Zzoop. "This belief in a clockmaker God appears key to human existential notions of meaning and purpose. Although a simplification, it seems an apt metaphor for their desire to find order, reason, and a sense of engineered destiny behind the seeming chaos of the universe."

The observers had discovered another perplexing yet illuminating insight into the complex species known as humankind. Theirclockmaker God, whether or not literally true, offered a window into the human mind and soul. The Zygons would have much more to discuss and many more theories to ponder as they continued observing life on Sol 3.
