Title: Anyone else hunkered down and riding this thing out? 
Submitted by u/survivalinstincts to r/ww3 

Things are really heating up out there with China and the US exchanging missile strikes. My family and I have locked down in our basement with supplies. Anyone else just staying put to avoid the chaos?

Yep, we're staying home as much as possible. I'm in a suburb of LA and it's chaos outside right now. Roads are jammed, stores have been looted, there are fires burning in the hills. We're safe so far but who knows how long this infrastructure will last if this conflict continues. Best to avoid it all and hunker down with whatever supplies you have. Godspeed to us all.

For anyone concerned, I have a shortwave radio and have been monitoring news reports. The latest:

•China launched airstrikes targeting US bases in Japan and Guam. The US retaliated with cruise missile strikes on Chinese bases. Both sides are threatening further escalation. 

•Internet infrastructure has been hit, with reports of damage to undersea cables and data centers. Expect more disruptions.

•There are widespread communication outages across North America and China. Many cities are without power.

•Russia and NATO allies are on high alert. There is concern the conflict could widen. The UN is calling for ceasefire and de-escalation.

Stay safe all. I'll report back with any updates to the situation. Let's hope cooler heads prevail.

The thread continues with people sharing updates, tips for staying supplied, and messages of hope and solidarity during this frightening fictional global conflict.
