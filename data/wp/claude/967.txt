I stumbled upon the website by accident one lonely Friday night. "Sign up to experience someone else's sad times," the garish pink and purple text proclaimed. Morbid curiosity got the better of me and I clicked.  

The site looked barebones but professional. "We connect people going through emotional struggles with those willing to take on the burden for a short time," the about page explained. "Using advanced virtual reality technology, we can transmit the thoughts and feelings of one person to an willing recipient to provide temporary relief."

It seemed absurd but I was in a strange mood. I created a profile and started reviewing posts. A college student with unrequited love. A man grieving his mother's death. A woman with chronic depression. The range of human suffering displayed was sobering.

One story caught my eye: a widowed single father of two young girls struggling to keep things together. "I just need a few hours of respite to rest and recharge so I can be strong for my daughters again," he wrote. Before I could think too hard about it, I clicked "Take on the burden."

A few seconds later, a lightweight VR headset was delivered by drone to my front porch. I put it on and suddenly found myself in a modest suburban home. Dishes were piled up, the kitchen was messy. I seemed to have memories of this place with a woman's presence, now conspicuously gone. Two adorable blond girls played in a room nearby. An avalanche of exhaustion, love, grief, and worry over their wellbeing washed over me. 

For the next three hours I folded laundry, washed dishes, cooked meals and helped the girls with homework, all the while filled with a poignant absence where a partner and equal co-parent should be. Snuggling with my "daughters" while reading bedtime stories left me in tears, overwhelmed by the tragedy of their loss at such a young age.  

After they were asleep, I found myself on the porch staring at the stars and conversing with the spirit of my late "wife". I apologized for any mistakes I might make and promised her I would do my best to hold the pieces of our family together. The depth of sorrow and longing in that moment will haunt me forever.

When the experience ended and I removed the headset, silent tears were running down my cheeks. I thought I had signed up out of little more than morbid curiosity but what I walked away with was life-changing. The website had given me a window into the profound resilience of the human spirit and a reminder of depths of compassion I could tap within myself. I went to bed with a lightness in my step having eased the burden on another person's shoulders, if only for a few hours. My petty concerns and worries faded into the background, leaving clarity and wisdom in their wake. I had witnessed the deepest valleys of human suffering and emerged with a gift: humility and grace.
