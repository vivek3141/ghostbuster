My Dearest Friends and Family, 

If you're watching this, then I am gone. I asked for this video to be played at my funeral to share with you my deepest secret, one I have kept hidden my entire life. I hope that in sharing this with you now, you may understand me better and forgive me for not telling you the truth when I was still alive.

From as early as I can remember, I have always felt like an outsider. While all of you went about your lives concerned with normal human things - love and laughter, heartbreak and hardship - inside I felt nothing. No joy or sorrow. No deep connections or caring for others. I have lived my entire life simply acting the part, pretending to feel what I knew was expected, what was normal and human. But in truth, I have never felt human at all. 

I discovered at a young age that I was very good at observing behaviors and mimicking them. I watched how people smiled when they were happy, frowned when they were sad, laughed when they felt joy. And so I taught myself to do the same, even though I felt none of those emotions myself. It was easy to pretend, and so much easier to go through life when people believed I felt as they did. And so I lived my life as a perfect facade.

Some of you were closer to me than others. You believed you knew my heart, my dreams, my fears. But in truth, I had none of those things. I am not even sure I had a heart at all. I wish I could say I feel regret for deceiving you, but I do not feel regret either. I feel nothing. I simply did what I had to do to survive and navigate a world I was never meant to be a part of.

And now my time has come to an end. I do not fear death, for as I said, I do not feel at all. I just wanted you all to know the truth so you would understand that when I was with you, I was never fully there. My greatest performance was the pretense of being human. I hope you can forgive the deception. I did not mean you any harm. I just did not know any other way to be.

Thank you all for being a part of my life. I wish I could say how much you meant to me, but you know now the truth. I cannot feel. I cannot care. I was just visiting this world. It was never meant to be my home.

Farewell, my friends. The pretense is over now. I go to the nothingness I have always known. I only hope I played my part well.
