It was a normal Tuesday afternoon when my life suddenly got very strange. I was sitting in chemistry class, only half listening as Mr. Thompson droned on about covalent bonds. My thoughts kept drifting to the pile of homework waiting for me after school and my plans to go to the park to practice some soccer moves. 

In the middle of class, I started to feel strange. At first, I thought maybe I was getting sick. My stomach felt fluttery and my skin started to tingle. I looked down at my hands and was shocked to see them start to fade away, becoming transparent. I gasped, grabbing the edge of the table. My lab partner, Jenny, looked over with concern.

“Are you okay?” she whispered. I couldn’t respond. I watched with building panic as my hands completely disappeared. But then, a moment later, they flickered back into view. I blinked hard, wondering if I had imagined the whole thing.

“I’m...fine,” I stammered. Jenny gave me a strange look but turned back to listening to Mr. Thompson. 

I tried to focus again on class but my mind was racing. Had I really seen my own hands disappear? It seemed impossible. I hesitantly looked down at my hands again, half expecting them to go transparent at any moment. But they remained solid. 

When the final bell rang, I hurried out of class, wanting to get home as fast as possible. My walk felt surreal, and I kept glancing around nervously expecting more impossibilities. But nothing strange happened. 

At home in my room, I sat down at my desk, trying to do my homework but struggling to concentrate. Part of me was sure I must have imagined the whole strange incident. But it had felt so real. I looked down at my hands again, taking deep breaths to stay calm. 

And then it happened again. My hands flickered and faded from view. I watched in shock as they completely disappeared for a few seconds before reappearing again. My heart racing, I stood up so fast I knocked my chair over. This couldn’t be happening. I didn’t even know what this was. 

I spent the rest of the evening testing out this bizarre new ability, willing my hands to disappear and reappear. Once I got over the initial shock and fear, a part of me started to feel a strange kind of wonder. I realized with dawning amazement that I could somehow shapeshift, at least in this small way. I didn’t know how or why I had developed this power, but I knew my life would never be the same. The world suddenly seemed full of possibilities. I was a shapeshifter.
