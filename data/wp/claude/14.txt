I'm really not sure why I took this job. I have family members who are retired Aurors. They view me with a mix of shame and despair. I've got family members who are pardoned Death Eaters, and they feel the same way. 

My name is Cassandra Blackwood. I come from a pure-blood wizarding family, though we have members on both sides of the war. My parents tried to remain neutral, but neutrality is impossible in times of conflict. My aunt and uncle were Aurors, fighting against He Who Must Not Be Named. My cousins, on the other hand, bore the Dark Mark.

After the war, my family was torn apart. The Aurors saw the Death Eaters as traitors to the cause of good. The Death Eaters saw the Aurors as blood traitors. My parents were caught in the middle, and I grew up in the tension, never fully accepted by either side. 

I thought, perhaps foolishly, that taking a job at the Ministry of Magic would help bridge the divide. I thought I could change perceptions, build new connections between the old factions. The Ministry was eager to appear open-minded and forward-looking after the war. They hired me without question.

Yet on my first day, I realized my mistake. In the Auror department, my uncles greeted me with tight lips and hard stares. They had expected me to follow in their footsteps, not work as a lowly administrative assistant. In other departments, former Death Eaters sneered as I walked by. To them, any Ministry job meant I had sided against them.

At lunch in the cafeteria, I sat alone. Someone from the Auror department ambled over, likely meaning to welcome me. But when he saw my last name on my badge, he turned on his heel and walked away without a word.

A few minutes later, another wizard sat down across from me. I recognized him from my childhoodâ€”the son of a Death Eater. "Cassandra Blackwood," he said with a mocking laugh. "Your family has strange ideas of loyalty. Let me guess, the Aurors wouldn't have you, so you begged the Ministry to take you?"

"I'm just here to do my job," I said. But my voice sounded weak even to my ears. 

He leaned forward. "You'll never escape your family legacy, no matter how hard you try. You'll always be a blood traitor to one side and a sympathizer to the other. You don't belong anywhere."

I wanted to argue, but the words rang painfully true. I didn't belong. I thought this job would be my fresh start, but my past followed me like a shadow. The curse of my family is that neither side would ever fully accept me or trust in my loyalty. I simply don't belong.
