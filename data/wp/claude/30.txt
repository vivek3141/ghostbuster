The stars twinkled in the inky black sky, like diamonds scattered on a velvet cloth. Maya gazed up at the sea of stars from the cabin porch, wrapped in a warm blanket. The Milky Way was a hazy band of light painting the night sky.

Despite the celestial spectacle, a gloominess permeated the night. The stars were too far, their light too faint, to illuminate the darkened landscape. The familiar surroundings of the forest were rendered unfamiliar in the dark, full of unseen dangers lurking in the shadows. The rustling of leaves felt ominous rather than soothing. The usual nighttime sounds of crickets and owls felt eerie when she couldn't see their source.   

Maya thought of her late husband, who used to sit with her stargazing at night. She missed cradling in his arms under the stars, feeling safe, sheltered and loved. Now the infinite universe felt cold and indifferent, and she a small, insignificant speck. The stars continued to shine as they always had, eternal and unchanging, while her little world had been plunged into darkness.

She stifled a sob and wiped a tear from her cheek. The night will always remain dark, she thought, no matter how many stars are shining. Their dim light only served to highlight the blackness, unable to truly illuminate or dispel it. 

Maya took a last lingering look at the stars and headed inside, locking the door firmly behind her. The stars could keep their cold comfort. She found solace in the warmth of her bedside lamp as she picked up a well-worn book of poetry and immersed herself in the familiar verses about love and light. The night remained dark outside, but her little cabin filled with the golden glow of light and soothing power of the human connection captured in those pages. The stars pale in comparison to the radiance of an indomitable human spirit.
