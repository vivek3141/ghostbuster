NASA Press Release: Trappist-1 System Found to Be Lit AF

In a startling discovery, NASA's interstellar music detection algorithm,  TEMPO-2, has found evidence that the Trappist-1 star system 39 light years from Earth is emanating trap music at an incredible volume.

"The readings are off the charts," said Dr. Maya Johnson, lead scientist for NASA's Exoplanet Rap and Hip Hop Observational Satellite (EROS). "Trap music appears to be permeating the entire star system and all seven of its Earth-sized planets. This is the strongest detection of a lit AF solar system we've encountered."

Mission control erupted in applause upon the discovery. For decades, NASA has searched for exoplanets that could harbor life, and now they have found a star system with ideal conditions for turning up. 

Upon further analysis, astronomers have concluded Planet G in the habitable zone of the star system in particular is emanating a wicked beat and most likely raging hard at this very moment. 

"The thumping bass, slick synthesizers, and auto-tuned vocals are unmistakable signatures of an extraterrestrial trap banger," said Johnson. "If any planet was designed for grinding and getting lit, it's Planet G."

NASA has already reoriented the Hubble Space Telescope to point at Trappist-1 in an attempt to see if there are any visible signs of turnt activity on the planets. They also transmitted a message of greeting and interest in trading mix tapes. A response is expected to arrive in 39 years.

The European Space Agency, always quick to follow NASA's lead, has proposed an ambitious new mission to send an orbiter to the Trappist-1 system. The craft would enter orbit around Planet G and drop loads of booze, party supplies, and neon lights to the surface in an attempt to make contact with whatever lit alien lifeforms might call the planet home.

However, critics argue that attempting to make contact with such an obviously lit civilization could be dangerous. "Any species that has mastered interstellar trap music is clearly far more advanced than we are," said an editorial in Scientific American. "We may not be ready to handle how lit these aliens really are." 

For now, the world can only speculate what frenetic scenes of turn't alien life await discovery on Planet G. All that's certain is that for outer space, it's about to be lit.
