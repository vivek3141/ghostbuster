The autumn air was crisp as I walked down the familiar street towards home. The leaves had turned vibrant shades of red and gold, the colors muted in the fading evening light. Most of the shops had already closed, and there was little foot traffic. 

As I approached the old brick apartment building on the corner, a figure emerged from the stairwell. Distracted by my phone, I bumped shoulders with the stranger, stumbling slightly.

“Oh, excuse me,” I said. But when I glanced up, the words caught in my throat.

It was me. My own face staring back at me, looking just as shocked as I felt. I blinked hard, certain it must be an uncanny lookalike or a hallucination. But when my eyes opened, the figure was still there. Wearing my favorite leather jacket, the one I had on. Carrying my backpack. 

In a daze, I watched as my double began to circle around me, examining my face and clothing with a mix of curiosity and disbelief. I should have felt threatened, but instead I was filled with a strange calm. There seemed an unspoken understanding between us. Two versions of the same person, occupying the same space at once yet unable to change what was destined to come. 

After a long moment, my double gave a small, wry smile and a nod. Then continued down the shadowy street, eventually disappearing from view under the golden glow of a streetlight in the distance. 

I stared after the retreating figure for a long time before turning to climb the stairs to my apartment. What had just happened, I couldn't explain. But somehow I knew everything would be different now. I had been given a mysterious gift—a glimpse into what might have been, and a reminder to walk mindfully into what was yet to come.
