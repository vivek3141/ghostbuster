The security line at the airport was particularly long today. I sighed, shuffling forward inch by inch, my overstuffed carry-on bag dragging behind me. At least I had arrived with plenty of time to spare for my flight. 

When I finally reached the conveyor belt to send my bags through the x-ray machine, I started unpacking my carry-on. Out came my laptop, placing it a bin. My quart-sized plastic bag of liquids - shampoo, conditioner and moisturizer - in another bin. My jacket and shoes came off and went into yet another bin. 

As I walked through the metal detector, it started loudly beeping. The TSA agent motioned for me to step aside for a manual check with the handheld metal-detecting wand. "Do you have anything metal on you, like jewelry or belts?" the agent asked.

"Just this small pendant necklace," I said, holding it up. The agent waved the wand over my body with no issue until it passed over my pant pocket. It let out a shrill beep.

The agent frowned. "Please empty your pockets into the bin and step back through the detector."

With a sigh, I placed my wallet, phone and the item in my pocket - a small velvet bag - into the bin. I walked back through the metal detector, which remained silent. 

The agent picked up the velvet bag from the bin, weighing it in his hand with a suspicious look. "What's in this bag?" he asked.

My heart started racing. I had forgotten I had placed that in my pocket this morning. "Just a good luck charm," I stammered. Technically not a lie.

"I'm going to have to examine this further. Please come with me," he said, grabbing my carry-on from the conveyor belt.

In a private screening area, the agent had me empty the contents of the velvet bag into another bin. Out spilled a collection of small bones, feathers and crystals. His eyes widened as he picked up one of the bones, inspecting the carvings on it.

"I'm sorry, but magic and spells are prohibited beyond the security checkpoint," he said firmly. "I cannot allow these charms through."

"But those are just trinkets, they have no actual power," I protested. My cheeks burned with embarrassment at this revelation of my secret hobby.

The agent shook his head. "I apologize, but for safety reasons we cannot make exceptions. These items will have to remain behind." He swept the contents of the small bin into a trash bag, sealing it shut.  

Head hung low, I returned to the main area of the airport, my now much lighter carry-on bag in tow. My flight departed on time, but I felt naked without my talismans and trinkets. Next time, I would be sure to leave anything resembling magic at home - TSA rules were not meant to be bent, lest I face a rather unpleasant interrogation again.
