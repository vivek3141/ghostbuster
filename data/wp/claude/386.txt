I straightened my badge and took a deep breath. Today was the first day of enforcing UN Resolution 334772G, which made it an international crime to post online content with bad grammar. As a newly appointed member of the Grammar Police, it was my duty to patrol the Internet and issue citations to anyone violating the new law. 

My virtual beat was social media. I started by searching for common grammar mistakes and typos on Twitter. It didn't take long. A influencer with over a million followers tweeted "Your all going to love my new product launch tomorrow!". *You're, I commented, and issued a warning citation. A minor first offense.

Next I moved on to Facebook. A viral post caught my eye: "The government doesn't want us to now the truth about what there putting in the water!". *know, *their, *they're. This was a clear violation. I issued a 500 credit fine and a mandate to take an online grammar course. 

Stopping by Instagram, a lifestyle blogger posted a photo with the caption "Me and my best friend are going on a road trip adventure!". *My best friend and I. I sighed,  commenting with the correction and a fine of 200 credits for the improper use of objective vs subjective pronouns.  

The violations seemed endless. Hashtags on Pinterest used for the wrong word forms. Incoherent rants filled with abbreviations and acronyms on Reddit. Auto-corrected nonsense phrases run amok in blog posts. MyCitationBook was filling up quickly.

At the end of my shift, I slumped in my chair, exhausted yet dismayed at the state of grammar on the Internet. My work as a Grammar Police officer was never done. There would always be another comment, post or tweet to review and rectify. But I persevered, bolstered by the knowledge that each citation issued brought us one step closer to a world of proper pronunciation, precision punctuation and flawless syntax. The law is passed, and I will uphold it. Now if you'll excuse me, there's a subreddit calling my name. Time to issue another fine!
