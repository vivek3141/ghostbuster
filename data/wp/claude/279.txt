The clicking of the typewriter keys echoed through the cavernous mansion as I recorded yet another petty squabble between the Wellingtons. When I was hired as their stenographer to chronicle their daily arguments, I thought it would at least be an easy job. I had no idea what I was in for.  

"You forgot to book the limo for the gala tonight, you imbecile!" shrieked Mrs. Wellington at her husband. I hammered the keys to capture each shrill word.

"I've been busy securing funding for your lavish lifestyle, woman, I don't have time for such trivial details!" Mr. Wellington bellowed in response. More clicking from me.  

This had been going on for hours. So far I had typed transcripts of arguments over misplaced jewelry, unpleasant encounters with friends at the club, and suspicions of imagined slights and infidelities. My fingers were growing numb and I was getting a migraine from the neverending vitriol.

"Shall I call the car service now, sir?" I interjected timidly during a lull in the shouting. Both Wellingtons turned to me, seeming to have forgotten I was even there.

"What? No, no, it's too late now," snapped Mrs. Wellington. "We'll be the laughingstock of the charity board, all because of your incompetence!" The typing resumed as they continued their tirade against each other.

By the end of the day, I had filled over 500 pages with records of their various squabbles, tiffs, and meltdowns. I packed up my typewriter with a sigh of relief that the workday had ended.  As I was leaving, a maid pulled me aside and pressed an envelope into my hands. Inside was double my usual pay.  

"They may be miserable with each other, but they do appreciate you accurately capturing their toxicity for their personal records," she whispered. "And take this - you've earned danger pay for subjecting yourself to these monsters all day!"

I accepted the generous bonus, but I had already decided this would be my last day. No amount of money was worth continuing to chronicle the constant carnage that was the Wellingtons' marriage. I couldn't possibly type fast enough to keep up with a lifetime's worth of their arguments. My fingers had given their notice, and now the rest of me gladly followed suit.
