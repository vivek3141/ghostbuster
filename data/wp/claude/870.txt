The Experiment 

I stared at the rows of children in the classroom, their vacant eyes gazing at nothing in particular. In the center of them sat a single boy, Adam, a perfectly ordinary 12-year old we had enrolled in this special needs program as an experiment. Our hypothesis was that children have an innate drive to conform and be accepted by their peers, even if it requires suppressing their true self.  

Adam awkwardly smiled at a girl near him who was drooling on her shirt, oblivious to his gesture. I sighed, already doubting this would work. My colleague Tom bet me $50 that Adam wouldn't last a week before telling his parents to withdraw him. I hoped I hadn't made a mistake.

At recess, Adam stood by himself on the edge of the playground, unsure of how to interact with his classmates. A few tried to get his attention but they quickly got distracted, wandering off to swing at imaginary objects or talk to people who weren't there. 

The next day, Adam deliberately bumped into walls and dropped pencils, trying to imitate the clumsiness and cognitive difficulties of his peers. I noted his attempts at conformity but his acting seemed forced. His expressions gave away that his mind was as sharp as ever.

By midweek, Adam grew more bold in joining nonsensical conversations and even made animal noises like some of the other children. But during creative time, as the others scribbled incomprehensible drawings, he sketched intricate buildings and machines. He was capable of so much more.

At the end of the first week, I pulled Adam from the experiment, worried we had taken things too far. His anxious parents signed him out that day, much to my relief and Tom's glee at winning the bet. 

While the drive to fit in is strong, a normal child surrounded by those with special needs will only feign conformity to a point. Adam's experiment showed the hardship of suppressing one's true self just to be accepted â€” and highlighted my own foolishness of assuming he would fully give in for the sake of blending into the group. The unethical experiment was shut down, and I learned an important lesson about human nature and the value of individuality.
