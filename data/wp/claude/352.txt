It started out innocently enough. A few weeks ago, I was living a normal life - working as an accountant, living alone in my small apartment, keeping to myself. I had a routine and mostly stayed out of trouble. 

Then the pandemic hit. My company laid off half the staff, including me. Suddenly I had no job, no income, and no idea how I was going to pay rent and buy food. I figured it was only temporary, that things would return to normal in a few weeks. I had some savings to tide me over.

The weeks dragged on and the virus only got worse. The stay-at-home orders were extended again and again. My savings dwindled down to nothing. I couldn't pay rent. I applied for government assistance but the system was overwhelmed. I spent hours on the phone and online trying to get through with no luck.

I started to get desperate. I hadn't eaten a proper meal in days. I was behind on every bill and the late fees kept piling up. My landlord threatened to evict me if I didn't pay rent immediately. I sold whatever valuables I had but it was barely enough to buy some rice and beans. 

One night, weakened by hunger and anxiety, I broke down. I couldn't do it anymore. I didn't know how I would survive another day. In a fit of despair I screamed into the empty room, cursing at the cruel world that brought me to this point. 

When the sun rose the next morning, something in me had changed. I was hardened. I realized no one was coming to save me. If I wanted to live I had to take matters into my own hands. My morality and ethics seemed trivial in the face of starvation. I decided I would do whatever it took to secure food and shelter, even if it meant hurting others. I felt I didn't have a choice.
 
In a daze, I walked to the nearest grocery store. I filled a bag and walked straight out the door. No one stopped me. Emboldened, I returned and filled a few more bags. As I was leaving again, one of the clerks grabbed my arm to stop me. Without thinking, I turned around and stabbed him with a knife I had taken for self defense. He fell to the floor. I hurried home, my hunger and desperation now mixed with a new emotion - the thrill of power over life and death.

I never wanted to become a savage, to commit such a violent act. I was a simple person living a simple life until circumstances conspired against me. Events outside my control left me no choice but to tap into my primal instincts to survive by any means necessary. My humanity became a luxury I could no longer afford. Now there's no turning back from the killer I've become.
