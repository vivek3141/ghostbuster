The Break-In 

I jimmied the lock on the back door and slipped inside the house. The owners were away for the weekend, off on some romantic getaway according to their Instagram posts. That left their place free for a quick burglary.

As I shone my flashlight around the kitchen, something caught my eye. The floor was spotless, still wet from a recent mopping. The scent of lemony floor cleaner filled the air. Great, I thought, now I have to be extra careful not to track dirt or make a mess. As a courtesy, I removed my shoes and left them by the back door. 

I padded across the kitchen in my socks, scanning the room for any valuables or cash. My light landed on an expensive-looking watch left out on the counter. Bingo. As I reached for it, my sock slid on the slick floor, nearly causing me to crash into the cabinet. I grabbed the edge of the counter at the last second to steady myself, holding my breath that I hadn’t marred the perfect floor. 

Carefully, I made my way to the living room, walking slowly with my arms out for balance. No valuables there, just a tidy room with family photos on the mantel. The dining room held a few pieces of silver that I added to my pack. So far, so good. I hadn’t left a single scuff or dirt mark anywhere according to my flashlight. 

Upstairs, two doors led to bedrooms. I tried the first door and found a home office, with an iMac and iPad on the desk that made my eyes light up. I went to grab them but nearly took a tumble down the hardwood stairs when my sock slipped again. My heart racing, I clutched the banister to stop my fall. I wouldn’t get far as a burglar if I ended up in the hospital with a broken neck!

More carefully than before, I descended the stairs backwards, gripping each banister spindle as I went. By the time I reached the first floor again, my nerves were shot. Between the slippery floors and narrow escapes, this was turning out to be more stress than it was worth. 

In the end, I left with only the watch, silver, and iPad. The risk of ruining the perfect floors or tumbling to injury was too high. My socked feet slid and stumbled out the back door, leaving not a trace of dirt or evidence of my visit. As burglaries go, it was a disappointing haul, but I accomplished what I had set out to do: rob the house without making a mess. My courtesy to the clean floors was intact, even if my pride as a thief was not. Some jobs just require you to wipe your feet at the door.
