The last human died today. I knew it was coming, yet it still felt shocking. We had survived so much together, the solar flares that wiped out power grids, the plague that decimated the population, the wars that followed. But time eventually caught up to us all. 

For years it had just been the two of us, scavenging in the abandoned towns, always watching each other's backs. We had formed a close bond as the sole survivors of our species. Now I was utterly alone.

As I buried my friend under the setting sun, an unsettling realization came over me. There was no longer any record of humanity left, nothing to prove we had ever existed at all on this planet. No art, no culture, no history. Civilization had collapsed into dust and memories.

Darkness fell as I searched the ruins of our little shelter for anything to indicate people had once built cities, told stories, raised families here. But there was nothing. Standing under a sky teeming with indifferent stars, I whispered a final goodbye to humanity into the cold and empty night. The future belonged to the wild now. Our time had come and gone forever.

All that was left of us would gradually vanish, like raindrops in the sea. The world would continue on as if we had never even been here at all. And soon, not a single trace would remain of the species that once called this little blue planet home.
