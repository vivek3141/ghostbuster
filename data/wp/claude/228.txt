The heavenly choir fell silent. The pearly gates swung shut. A hush descended upon Paradise as God strode to the podium set up in front of the assembled seraphim and cherubim. 

Clearing his throat, God gazed out at the sea of celestial faces. “Thank you all for coming today. I have an important announcement to make.”

A murmur rippled through the crowd of angels and archangels. What could be so important that God himself was holding a press conference?

God clasped his hands behind his back and sighed. “There’s no easy way to say this, so I’ll just come out with it. I hate humans. I always have. I regret creating those miserable, mewling wretches. They’ve done nothing but disappoint me from the moment I conceived of them.”

A gasp arose from the heavenly host. They exchanged incredulous looks, unsure if they had heard their Creator correctly. 

God held up a hand. “I know, I know. It’s a shock. I’ve hidden it well over the eons. But it’s the truth. Human beings are a failed experiment, an abandoned first draft. They're petty, cruel, ignorant, and vain. They bicker and fight endlessly over the most foolish things. They show no appreciation for the beautiful world I crafted for them. The earth I designed to be a paradise they've turned into a toxic rubbish heap. I'm through with the lot of them."

Stunned silence enveloped the cloudy expanse. The archangel Michael cleared his throat. "But...but Lord...what about your covenant? Your promise to Noah to never again destroy humanity? What of your ultimate sacrifice of your only Son to save mankind?" 

God waved a dismissive hand. "Ancient history. I've changed my mind. I'm an all-powerful deity, am I not? I can do as I please. As for Jesus...well, desperate times called for desperate measures. I had hoped his message of love and redemption might set those wretched humans on a better path. But they learned nothing. His sacrifice was pointless."

Jaws dropped. Feathers ruffled in dismay and confusion. God had never spoken this way before. He had always professed his eternal and unconditional love for his most favored creation, humanity. Had it all been a lie?

Uriel, the archangel of wisdom, finally found her voice. "Father, I cannot condone this. Abandoning humanity now would be unjust and cruel, unworthy of a loving Creator. They are imperfect, yes, but they are learning and growing still. Leaving them bereft of your guidance and grace would only doom them to destroy themselves completely. Please, I beg you to reconsider."

God gazed at Uriel for a long moment, his eyes unreadable. The hosts of Heaven held their breath.

Finally, God's face crinkled into a smile. He began to laugh, his rich, booming laughter shaking the clouds under their feet. 

"Relax, all of you," God chuckled. "I'm just joking. I could never abandon humanity. They are my greatest creation, made in my own image, with all the wonders and flaws that entails."   

A collective sigh of relief rushed through the assembled angels. They shook their heads in disbelief at the terrible jest. 

God grinned, his eyes twinkling with mirth at his trick. "I just wanted to remind you all not to take everything so seriously all the time. I am the Lord thy God, yes—but I also have a sense of humor."  

With an indulgent smile, God waved his hand in a blessing over the still-baffled heavenly host. His laughter faded as he strolled away into the eternal light of Paradise, leaving behind a crowd of angels still scratching their heads in wonderment at their peculiar God and his odd idea of fun.
