The Logic of Madness 

John was a rational man. As a mathematician, he appreciated logical reasoning and clear thinking. So when the visions started, he tried to analyze them scientifically.

The first vision was of a creature with spindly limbs and pale blue skin. Logically, he knew it was impossible. He ran through potential medical explanations. A hallucination? A brain tumor? He scheduled a doctor's appointment. His brain scan and tests were normal.

The visions continued, each more disturbing than the last. Although alarming, John remained calm. He journaled the frequency and details of each episode, looking for patterns. There were none. But there must be an explanation, be it psychological or physiological. A puzzle to be solved.

His rational mindset started to crumble with the whispers. At first, he thought it was his auditory cortex malfunctioning. But soon the whispers turned into voices. They mocked him, commenting on his every move. Again he saw doctors. Again tests showed nothing wrong. 

The voices grew louder and more hostile, disrupting his thoughts and concentration. Still he refused to give in to fear or confusion. He researched treatments for auditory hallucinations and tried self-help strategies to ignore the voices. None worked.

His grasp on reason was slipping. In one vision, his eyes were plucked out by a malevolent raven. Another time, beetles burrowed out of his eardrums. He knew these couldn't be real, yet they felt utterly tangible. His mind was betraying him.

One day, John's logic finally broke under the strain. As he studied an equation, the symbols rearranged into a revelation that the government had bugged his brain. It seemed a rational conclusion. He tore apart his home but found no surveillance devices. Yet he knew with certainty that they were there.

By the time John's brother found him, he was beyond reach. His rational mind had failed him, a mere husk drowned out by the chorus of madness inside his head. The doctors could only shake their heads. Though his brain was sound, John's grasp on reality had slipped away, the logic of madness reigning in its place.
