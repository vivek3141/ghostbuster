My parents were overjoyed when my baby sister Emma was born. But as the months went by, something strange happened—she didn't seem to age. She remained a babbling infant while I grew into a toddler and started elementary school. 

At first, my parents dismissed it as a fluke or trick of the memory. But soon it was undeniable. Emma stayed a baby as I turned 10, then 15. My parents were terrified and confused. They took Emma to doctor after doctor, searching for answers. But no one had an explanation.

As I matured into a young woman, Emma remained a helpless baby. I had mixed feelings—sadness for my sister's stunted life, combined with annoyance at her constant needs. But she was family, so I helped care for her when my parents couldn't.

Emma's unchanging nature was our family secret. We told no one the truth and made excuses for why she never joined me at school or family events. I lived a strange double life, experiencing all the normal milestones while watching my baby sister stay trapped in infancy.  

It was a lonely, isolating childhood in many ways. But Emma brought us joy too, even as she remained a mystery with no answers in sight. Her eternal babyhood taught me to accept life's uncertainties and gave me a sense of purpose as her protector and caretaker. Emma was a gift and a burden, a blessing and a curse, and the sister I could never truly understand.
