The stalking had begun in earnest. For the past week, David had tracked the movements and habits of his newest target, a young woman named Emily who lived alone in a modest duplex. He knew when Emily left for her job at the library each weekday morning, the route she walked each evening with her dog, and that she had a standing coffee date with a friend every Saturday at the café down the street. 

David felt the familiar rush of adrenaline and anticipation as he conducted his stakeout from a distance. He was careful to vary his vantage points and never linger for too long in any one spot. His methods were disciplined and meticulous, honed over many previous hunts. He took extreme care to avoid detection - his success and freedom depended on it. 

On this Saturday evening, David waited in the lengthening shadows for Emily to return from walking her dog. But this time, Emily did not return alone. Through his binoculars, David watched in disbelief as Emily strolled up the walkway to her front door, accompanied by a handsome man he had never seen before. His hands tightened around the binoculars in rage and jealousy as Emily and her companion laughed and talked on her doorstep. After several minutes of flirtatious conversation, Emily leaned forward and kissed the man tenderly before turning to unlock her front door.

A seething, vengeful fury grew in the pit of David’s stomach. How dare this stranger infringe on what was his! David had spent days crafting Emily's demise in his mind, and no interloper was going to ruin his plans. He would simply need to eliminate the competition first.

As night fell, David crept around to the side of the house and found a suitable vantage point to watch for the man to emerge. An hour passed, then two, but the man did not leave. David's anger intensified, burning like a branding iron. He clenched his hands into tight fists, nails digging into flesh, fighting the urge to batter down the front door that instant. But he had waited this long. He could wait longer.

In the deepest part of the night, David was jolted from a light doze by the sound of Emily's front door opening and closing. He peered around the corner to see the man walking down the front path, hands in pockets, whistling softly to himself. David slipped a long knife from the sheath under his jacket and began to stealthily make his way across the dark lawn. 

Suddenly, just as David prepared to pounce, a dark figure emerged from the shadows behind the man and clamped a gloved hand over his mouth, stifling his muffled yell of surprise. It was over in seconds. The figure held a glint of steel to the man's throat and sliced deeply. David watched in stunned silence as the man's body crumpled limply to the ground, dark blood pooling on the walkway.

The figure turned, and for the first time David recognized that this was no random attacker. He was being hunted by another predator, one who had been stalking him unseen as David stalked Emily. Their eyes locked across the lawn, a clash between two apex predators in a battle for territory. But in that moment David knew, with grim certainty, that he had already lost. The hunt was over.

Before David could react, the predator lunged at him with lightning speed, knife slashing and stabbing. Pain erupted, hot and searing. David attempted to fight back, but his limbs wouldn't obey. As the predator dealt the final blow, David's last thought was of Emily. In death, as in life, she had eluded his grasp. His reign of terror was ended, cut short by a monster more evil and calculating than himself.
