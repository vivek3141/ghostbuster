The Prompting of the Muse 

The blank page sat before me, as vacant and pale as a new fallen snow. My quill rested idle, awaiting the inspiration that so often eluded my grasping mind. On this chill winter's morn, the warmth and light of creativity seemed but a distant memory.

As I gazed listlessly out my frost-kissed windowpane, my eyes fell upon a small bird perched on a bare branch. Tilting its head, it regarded me keenly with one beady eye, as if discerning my poetic plight. The tiny creature trilled out a few sweet notesâ€”a song of encouragement to my dormant imagination. 

In a trice, the bird took flight, vanishing into the gray sky and leaving behind a single feather that drifted gently down to land on my sill. This lone plume, so eloquently gifted, kindled in me a spark which rapidly grew into a blaze of idea and prose. Grabbing my quill, I fervently scratched out line after line, page after page, no longer feeling the cold.

When at last my fevered writing calmed, I reviewed the fruits of my labors. The poem that had emerged was an ode of gratitude to the small bird who had so charitably prompted my muse to once again take wing. This tiny messenger had granted the boon of inspiration when I had all but given up hope. With wondrous artistry, a single plucked feather had unlocked for me the door to poesy.

Here was a prompt that had stirred my soul to poetry. And of all the prompts to which I have set my pen, this gentle bird's feathered gift remains my most cherished.
