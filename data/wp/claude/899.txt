It was just another regular Friday night. My wife was out at her book club and I was home alone with my teenage daughter Jenny. Jenny had been acting a bit strange recently, coming home late and being very secretive about who she was spending time with. I attributed it to normal teenage moodiness and gave her some space. 

Around 10pm, I heard some strange noises coming from outside. It sounded like yelling and loud bangs. Concerned there might be some kids causing trouble outside, I went upstairs to peak out Jenny's window which faced the street. But her room was empty. The noises outside intensified, now accompanied by bright flashes of light. 

Worried there might be a dangerous situation unfolding, I rushed outside. I turned the corner to the alleyway behind our house and froze in my tracks. There in the alleyway were Jenny and a group of girls from her school. But they were not just hanging out. They were in strange brightly colored outfits and appeared to be battling a large hideous creature!

Jenny and two other girls were firing beams of energy from their hands at the monster while dodging its attacks. Another girl had created some kind of force field to shield them. As I watched in stunned disbelief, the monster swung a massive claw at a girl with orange hair, knocking her to the ground. 

"Hannah, look out!" Jenny yelled. She leapt in front of the girl to protect her. The monster's claw came swiping down but Jenny threw up her hands and a bright pink light shot out, slicing its claw clean off. The monster roared in rage and pain. 

I must have made a sound because Jenny's friend with the force field turned around. "Mr. Thompson, get back inside!" she cried. But it was too late. The monster had spotted me. I stared into its glowing red eyes, frozen in fear. It started lumbering towards me, raising its remaining claw to attack.

"No!" Jenny screamed. She rushed at the beast, pink energy glowing around her hands. With a mighty yell, she thrust her hands forward and a huge beam of pink light erupted, enveloping the monster. There was a massive explosion and the creature burst apart, dissolving into ashes. 

Jenny stood there, breathing heavily, her magical outfit fading away as she turned back to normal. The other girls cheered as they too returned to their regular clothes. Jenny's eyes went wide as she spotted me. 

"Dad! I...I can explain!" she stammered. My magical girl daughter. I had just discovered her secret in possibly the most embarrassing and traumatic way for a teenage girl. This was going to be an awkward conversation.
