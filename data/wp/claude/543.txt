The piercing wail of the ambulance siren grew louder as it sped down the street towards me. My heart raced. There hadn't been an accident, at least not yet. 

The new predictive technology the emergency services deployed allowed them to anticipate accidents before they happened. Receiving a warning of an impending collision at this intersection, the ambulance raced over, hoping to arrive in time.

I walked quicker through the crosswalk, eager to get out of harm's way. As I stepped onto the sidewalk, an old Sedan came careening around the corner, tires squealing. The driver smashed into a minivan entering the intersection, sending it spinning.

The ambulance pulled up just as the crash occurred, emergency responders immediately jumping out. They raced over and began extricating the passengers from the mangled vehicles. Thanks to the alert, they were on the scene in moments, able to provide critical aid and rush the injured to the hospital.

My heart pounded as I watched the rescue efforts unfold. While the technology was unsettling, it saved lives today. The blaring siren that had startled me now faded into the distance, off to warn of another impending emergency somewhere else in the city. The future was here, predicting accidents and dispatching help before disaster struck. I shivered at the thought and looked both ways once more before safely crossing the street.
