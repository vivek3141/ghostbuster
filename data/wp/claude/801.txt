The old wooden sign creaked in the wind, "Welcome to the Village of Azantria." Mara tugged her cloak tighter as she walked through the gates. Her kind was not welcome here. 

Mara was an Umbra Mage, able to control darkness and shadows. Most kingdoms outlawed her kind, fearing their power. But Azantria was different. All mages were welcome and treated as equals.

As Mara wandered the busy village square, a burst of flames erupted from a shop, followed by laughter. Children played with a young Fire Mage, cheering as he created dancing fire animals. On the other side of the square, an Ice Mage helped vendors keep their wares chilled, sculpting decorative ice figurines for the children. 

Mara smiled, comforted to see mages and villagers living in harmony. She walked over to an old stone fountain, waving her hand to manifest a small shadow creature. It danced around the fountain, eliciting giggles from the children playing there.

Their laughter faded as angry shouts echoed from an alley. Mara ran over to find a Water Mage trapped in a globe of darkness, gasping for air. An evil laugh rang out as a shadowy figure emerged from the darkness.

"Umbra's shall rule, starting with the destruction of this pitiful village!" he roared. He flung a spear of darkness towards a child.

Mara leapt forward, intercepting it with her power. She summoned light to pierce the globe of darkness, freeing the Water Mage. "You disgrace our kind," she spat at the villain.

They dueled, shadow against shadow, darkness against light. The villain snarled, "Our power is meant to conquer, not serve these weaklings!"

Mara smiled, "You are wrong. Our power is a gift, meant to help and protect." She stunned him with a blast of light, knocking him out. 

The villagers erupted into cheers as the mayor ran over. "Thank you for saving our village," he said. "You have proven that one's power alone does not determine good or evil. You will always be welcome here."

Mara's eyes shone with grateful tears. She had found a home at last.
