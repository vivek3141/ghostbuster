I couldn't believe it. After years of waiting, my 11th birthday had finally arrived. I was excited to get my letter from Hogwarts, to learn magic and become a real wizard. But instead of an owl delivering my invitation, there was a knock at the door. 

A strange man stood there, wearing muggle clothes. He introduced himself as a scientist studying magic. He sat down with my parents and I, looking very serious. "I'm afraid I have some difficult news," he said. "After extensive testing, we have found no evidence that true magic exists or that this boy has any magical abilities."

My heart sank. "But I've shown signs of magic! I once turned my teacher's hair blue when I was angry with them. And I always know when the neighbor's cat wants feeding, even from far away!" 

The scientist shook his head. "I'm sorry, but there are rational explanations for all those events. Magic and wizardry are fanciful notions not grounded in science."

I couldn't hold back my tears. My whole life I had dreamed of going to Hogwarts. Now that was ripped away. The scientist explained I would have to attend a normal muggle school instead. 

After he left, my parents tried to comfort me. But their words rang hollow. They had lived their whole lives believing in magic too. 

The next morning, I didn't awake to the sounds of owls tapping on my window. Instead, just the mundane chirps of regular birds. No special letter had arrived overnight. 

With a heavy heart, I realized the scientist was right. There would be no Hogwarts for me. No more dreaming of joining the wizarding world I had always hoped to be part of. My world had lost its magic - I was just a normal boy after all, facing a muggle future I never wanted. My 11th birthday had brought not wonder but a harsh dose of reality. The life I always imagined living had vanished in a snap of the fingers. I was going to have to learn to accept an ordinary world without magic.
