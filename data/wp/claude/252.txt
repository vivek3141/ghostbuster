The old mansion was silent as Frederick lay in the grand four-poster bed, his ragged breath the only sound. He was fading, his body growing weaker with each labored inhalation.  

His loving family surrounded him, their faces masks of concern and grief. His eldest daughter dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief, leaning against her somber husband for comfort. His sons stood at the foot of the bed, jaws clenched as they watched their once vigorous father slip away.

Frederick reached out a trembling hand toward his family. His youngest son grasped it, squeezing gently. “We’re here, Father,” he said softly. 

Frederick gazed at each loved face through dimming eyes. How had he gotten so ill? He had been in excellent health just days before, still riding every morning and joining family dinners each evening. Yet suddenly he had taken to his bed, a mysterious malaise sapping his strength. The doctor had no diagnosis, only advice to rest as much as possible. But rest had not halted the steady decline.

His wife, Amelia, sat closest, dabbing a moist cloth to his clammy forehead. Her eyes were red but dry; she had already shed all her tears. “My love,” she whispered. “You should rest. Save your strength.”

He gave her hand a weak squeeze and was surprised to find it cold. Had she always had such cold hands? He couldn't remember. His head throbbed as he tried to think. 

Amelia brought a glass of water to his lips but he turned away, a strange bitterness in his mouth making him nauseous. “No more,” he croaked. 

She set the glass aside and stroked his cheek. He leaned into her familiar touch, remembering all they had shared over fifty years of marriage. Her hand gentled, soothing him to sleep.

He woke later, alone but for Amelia dozing in a chair. The room was dim, night having fallen. His whole body ached for reasons he couldn’t fathom.

Amelia started awake and came to his side. “How are you feeling?” she asked. She lifted another glass to him but again the acrid smell made his stomach churn.   

“No water,” he said. “Thirsty but can’t drink.”

She frowned. “The doctor left medicine. I'll prepare it now.”

As she bustled away, Frederick's fragmented thoughts coalesced into clarity. The mysterious illness, the bitter taste, his family’s strange behavior—it all pointed to one inescapable conclusion. They were poisoning him.  He didn't know how or why, only that with each dose they administered, they were killing him slowly.

Panic flooded him. He was trapped, too weak to call out or escape from this room that would become his tomb. All he could do was wait in silent terror for Amelia to return, medicine in hand, and minister to him one final, fatal time.
