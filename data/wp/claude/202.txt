Jenny was always careful to hide her strange ability. Ever since she was a little girl, she knew she was different. While other kids played with toys, Jenny would stare at objects and make them vibrate. At first, it was fun to rattle pencils and spoons around, but her parents warned her it was dangerous. 

“This is our secret,” they said. “You can never show anyone what you can do.”

Jenny learned to control her power, but she never understood why it had to be hidden. She wondered if there were others out there like her. As she grew up, she practiced aiming her power at larger objects, finding the right frequency to make everything from pillows to chairs tremble and shake. She thought of it as a useless parlor trick, except for the one time she used it in self defense to scare off a mugger by rattling a trash can at him.

When Jenny became a physics student at the university, she kept her head down and her secret ability hidden. But late one night, as she studied in the lab, she sensed someone else was there. She peered around the corner and saw a young man staring intensely at a pencil, which was rolling slowly across the table. 

Jenny gasped, and the man looked up, startled. His eyes went wide. 

“You're like me,” Jenny said in disbelief. 

The man nodded slowly. "I can make small objects move. I've never met anyone else who could."

"Me neither."

They introduced themselves as Mark and Jenny. For the first time, Jenny didn't feel so alone in the world. They began meeting secretly, comparing the nuances of their powers and how they'd kept them hidden. One night, as they were aiming their powers at the same object, something strange happened. The pencil they were both controlling started spinning and vibrating violently, shaking across the table in a frenzy.

Mark's eyes lit up. "When we work together, the power magnifies exponentially!"

Jenny felt a thrill at discovering what they could do together. But her parents' warnings came flooding back. "This is dangerous. We could really hurt someone. We have to keep this a secret."  

"You're right," Mark agreed reluctantly. "But think of how we could help people if we learned to control it!"

Against her better judgment, Jenny continued meeting with Mark in secret, practicing combining their powers. But soon tables and chairs were rattling, then whole bookcases. Their ability was growing stronger and they were losing control.  

One night, as they aimed at a parked car, its engine revved to life and the vehicle shot forward, crashing through a wall. Alarms went off across the campus. 

Jenny looked around in a panic. "This has gone too far. We have to stop!"

But Mark's eyes shone with excitement. "Don't you see? Together, we could do anything!"

Jenny knew then she had made a terrible mistake. Her parents were right - some secrets were meant to stay hidden. She ran off into the night, vowing never again to use her power or tell another soul her dangerous secret.
