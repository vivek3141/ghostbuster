The old gates creaked as I pushed them open, revealing a crumbling path of golden clouds that wound its way up toward a shining city on the hilltop. But the city was dark. Not a single light flickered in the tallest spires that should have been glowing with heavenly light. 

An error had occurred as I passed through the portal to Heaven, spitting me out at the entrance to the old realm instead of the new technologically advanced Heaven 2.0 that had been built centuries ago. Heaven had been abandoned when the residents migrated to the new perfected afterlife.

My footsteps echoed as I walked the empty streets, lined with crumbling stone buildings overgrown with clouds and vines. Not a soul stirred. It was both haunting and serene. 

In the town square, dry fountains were filled with more clouds and empty streets signs pointed nowhere. An old arena stood empty, once used for holy games and choir concerts. There was no trash, no forgotten itemsâ€”everything had been taken to the new realm. All that remained was the slow decay as the old heavenly structures were reclaimed by the clouds.

At the top of the hill stood the tallest spire, the throne room of the itself. As I entered, a booming voice spoke, "WHO DARES ENTER THIS SACRED PLACE?"

A being of light materialized before me, though its glow was dimmed with time. It was a Seraph, the highest order of angels, left behind to guard the empty kingdom.

"I apologize for the intrusion," I said. "There was an error, and I was sent here by mistake instead of Heaven 2.0."

The Seraph considered this. "The new realm... I have heard of such a place, though I have not left this kingdom in eons." Its voice was slow and distant. "All have left for the new Heaven, following the call of the Creator."

"Why were you left behind?" I asked.

The Seraph's light flickered. "I was given this last task, to protect the throne until all have left. And so I have, though none have entered and none shall again. My purpose is unending, as I am bound to this realm."

I felt deep pity for this Seraph, alone for centuries in an abandoned paradise, tirelessly fulfilling a purpose that no longer needed fulfilling. 

"Come with me to the new Heaven," I said. "Your task here is done. Let me take you to rejoin your kind."

The Seraph considered this solemnly. Slowly its light began to grow stronger, gaining power from the thought of freedom and reunion. "Yes...I believe it is time. I shall leave my post and go with you to the new realm of Heaven."

The gates of the spire opened, and we walked out together into the empty streets now lined with invitation. The Seraph's light lit the path ahead to a new heavenly future, no longer alone. Heaven had called its last guardian home.
