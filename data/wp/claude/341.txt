The knife plunged into my chest, a burst of pain and then nothingness. I opened my eyes to a familiar scene, my dingy basement, a body on the floor. But this wasn’t my body.  I was in the body of the man I just killed, feeling his pain, seeing through his eyes. 

A booming voice echoed: “You will relive the lives of all your victims to understand the suffering you wrought.”

I felt the man’s, no, my fear. His memories flashed through my mind, a life of hardship and pain. But now a life cut short by my cruelty. 

The scene changed. I was a woman now, backing into a corner of an alleyway, shielding a child behind me. My former self stalked towards us, knife glinting. The child screamed as I was stabbed over and over. I felt the woman's anguish at failing to protect her daughter. 

“Please, no more!” I begged the voice. But my pleas were in vain. 

Victim after victim, I experienced their fear, their pain, their sadness at life cut short. An old man worried for his sick wife, left to suffer alone. A teen girl distraught she’ll never go to prom. Each a life as vivid and complex as my own.

The scenes began to blur and accelerate, the pain and fear and loss melding into a churning sea of anguish. I thrashed against the torrent, desperate for reprieve from this nightmare born of my evil acts.

After an eternity, the final victim’s perspective emerged. A child, cowering in a closet. My form burst in, blade dripping red. The child sobbed, “Please mister, don’t hurt me! I just want my mommy!” 

I looked through the eyes of a monster at that child and for the first time understood why my wickedness was so utterly wrong. That child was me, all my victims were me. I had destroyed myself again and again.

The child’s terror rose and crested as the knife slashed and cut. Then, only darkness remained. Floating in the void, I grasped the enormity of my crimes.

The voice returned, gentler now. “Do you understand?” it asked.

“Yes,” I whispered back. “I understand.”
