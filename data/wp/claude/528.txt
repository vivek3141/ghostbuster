The seconds ticked down as I stared at the clock, hearts pounding in anticipation. In just a minute, at the stroke of noon on my 18th birthday, a word would appear on my skin depicting my destiny. 

My whole life had led up to this moment. Everyone discovered their life's purpose on their 18th birthday, marked permanently on their body for all to see. For some it was simple, like "Teacher" or "Builder." For others more cryptic, open to interpretation.

10 seconds left. My family and friends gathered around, waiting to celebrate the revelation of my future.

5...4...3...2...1...

I felt a tingling on my wrist and looked down in excitement. But there was no word. Just my bare wrist, unmarked.

A hush fell over the room. This was supposed to be a joyous occasion, but now confusion and concern clouded the faces of my loved ones. 

Why was my wrist blank? Did this mean I had no purpose or destiny? Anxiety rose in my chest as I rubbed my wrist, hoping the word was just taking time to appear.

After several minutes of silence my grandmother spoke. "The word will come when the time is right.Not all life's purposes are revealed at once. Yours is still unfolding."

Her words soothed my worries. She was right - my destiny was not defined by a single word on a single day. My purpose in life would reveal itself over time through my choices, experiences, and personal journey. 

I looked around at my family now smiling in agreement. The celebration commenced, the initial confusion and concern melting away as quickly as they had come. My destiny was still before me, an unwritten future waiting to be crafted through the story of my life. The blank space on my wrist now a reminder of the unbound potential still ahead.
