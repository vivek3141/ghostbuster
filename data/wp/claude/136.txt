The old camera had been in my family for generations. It could see the value and worth of any object, glowing brightly for priceless  artifacts and dim for the mundane.

I had never dared use it on a person. Who was I to judge a human's intrinsic value?

One day, walking through the park, I saw a young boy crying on a bench. "I lost my father's watch! It's the only thing I have to remember him by!"

My heart broke for the child. I hesitated, then said "I may be able to help." I prepared to tell him about my camera, hoping its glow might lead us to the watch. 

But as I looked at the boy through the viewfinder, ready to speak, I froze. His form was illuminated from within by a warm, bright light. I realized with wonder that the camera saw in him something far more valuable than any material object.

I put down the camera. "Don't worry," I told him gently. "We'll find your watch. You should know you're very special, with or without it."

The boy sniffed. "Do you really think so?" 

I smiled at him. "I know so." My magical camera had shown me what really mattered. Sometimes the most valuable things in life have nothing to do with what can be bought or sold.
