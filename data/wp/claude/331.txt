Childhood Memory 

The old rope swing, hanging from the oak, 
Swaying gently in the summer breeze.
Laughter echoing through the woods,
As I pump my legs to go higher and higher.

The sun filtering through the leafy canopy,
Dappling the ground with shadows and light.
Not a care or worry in my young heart,
Just the thrill of the ride and escape from the ground.

The cool grass beneath my bare feet,   
As I drag them along the ground to slow my ascent.
Pushing off again to feel the floating sensation,
As I soar up towards the puffy white clouds.

The snap of the rope as I reach the apex,  
Pausing for a second at the top of the arc. 
The world below me, lush, vibrant and verdant,
Spreading as far as my eyes can see.

A perfect summer day, without schedule or chore,
Just freedom and joy in the swing's rhythmic motion.
The sun warming my skin and the wind in my hair,
A childhood memory forever etched in my mind.

cherished moments of youthful delight, 
When time seemed endless and responsibilities light.
If only I could go back for one day,
And relive the simple pleasures that have slipped away.
