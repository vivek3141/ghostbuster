The pale horse stood silently in the stables, its rider nowhere to be seen. Pestilence approached the steed and patted its muzzle. “Where has your master gone, I wonder?” The horse neighed softly.

In the dimly lit chamber, War polished his sword while Famine counted the gold coins in his purse. Again and again. Pestilence strode in, his face grim. 

“Death has vanished. His pale horse stands alone.”

War leapt up, clutching his sword. “How can this be? The four horsemen ride as one. We have held dominion over humanity since time immemorial.”

“And yet Death has disappeared without a trace,” Pestilence replied. “We must find a replacement to take up the mantle, to complete the four and continue our eternal task.”

“But who among humanity possesses a darkness great enough to become the new Death?” Famine asked, pouring the gold coins from hand to hand, the familiar clinking sound echoing in the chamber. 

Pestilence smiled, cold and cruel. “There is evil and malice enough in the human realm. We need merely uncover the most sadistic and black-hearted mortal, and offer them the gift of immortality to stand by our side.”

“Then let the search begin,” War crowed, thrusting his sword skyward.  

They ventured into the mortal world under cover of night. Pestilence walked through hospitals and sick houses, observing a petty thief letting the ill die in an alley to loot their corpses. Famine visited starving villages and watched a farmer burning crops while his people starved. War gazed upon blood-soaked battlefields, as a mercenary slayed civilians and enemy alike, his eyes alight with frenzied bloodlust.

They convened and shared what they had witnessed. “The mercenary,” War boasted. “The thrill of death courses through his veins.”

“The cold-hearted farmer would let thousands die to line his pockets,” Famine countered.  

Pestilence shook his head. “The thief has potential for cruelty, but not the scale we require. Our new Death must sow destruction on a grander scale.”

In the end, they chose the mercenary. They offered him eternal life and the power to reap souls with impunity. His eyes glowed red at the promise, and with a roar he swung himself upon the pale horse, taking up the mantle of Death, fourth horsemen of the Apocalypse. The four were complete once more, and continued their everlasting reign over humanity. Death had awakened anew.
