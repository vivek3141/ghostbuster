The License 

Jenna was given her license to kill on her 18th birthday, as was the tradition. One free pass to end a life without consequences. Some used it quickly in a fit of rage or passion. Others saved it their whole lives, viewing it as a grim fail-safe they hoped to never use.

Jenna fell into the latter camp. Now 68, she had held onto her license her whole life. There were certainly people who had angered or upset her over the years, but never enough to make her want to kill them. She had lived a peaceful, uneventful life and kept her license tucked away in her drawer, unused.

That is, until she received the devastating diagnosis of terminal pancreatic cancer. As Jenna's health rapidly declined, she was faced with a decision she never thought she'd have to make. She could expire quietly and peacefully, surrounded by loved ones. Or she could use her long-dormant license and choose her own ending on her own terms. 

Jenna thought of her loving husband, Tom, and how much he still needed her. She thought of her children and grandchildren, all eagerly awaiting visits from their cherished matriarch. In the end, however, Jenna knew what she had to do to avoid becoming a shell of her former self, suffering in agony during her final days.  

One night, as Tom slept by her side, Jenna retrieved the license from the drawer in her bedside table. After one last look at her devoted husband, she injected herself with the concoction the doctor had prescribed to keep her comfortable. As the solution flowed into her veins, Jenna closed her eyes and breathed a sigh of relief. She was able to end life with the same dignity with which she lived it, thanks to the license given to her so many years ago. A license, as it turned out, she was eternally grateful to have and use on her own terms.
