The gunshot rang out, echoing through the empty parking garage. I froze in place, stunned by the scene in front of me. 

A man I had never seen before stood there, arm outstretched, pistol in his hand. But now he was crumpling to the ground, a pool of blood already forming around his head.

In the last moments before he collapsed, he had thrust out his other hand, holding a credit card, offering it to me. I took it numbly, confused and terrified by what was happening.

As the man hit the ground, my eyes drifted down to the card in my hands. At first, the name on the front remained his. John McGillicuddy. A name meaning nothing to me.

But as I looked at the card, the letters began to fade and shift. Like a mirage, the name changed to my own: Jessica Walker.

Impossible. I blinked, rubbed my eyes, stared at the card again. But it still read my name, my name on this dead man's credit card.

Hands shaking, I reached for my wallet, pulled out my own card to compare. They were identical. Not just the name - the numbers, expiration date, security code were all the same.

This couldn't be real. People don't just hand you credit cards and kill themselves. And credit card numbers don't magically change. I was hallucinating, or still asleep in my bed at home.

But the blood, thick and red, soaking into the pavement of the parking garage, was horrifyingly real. I squeezed my eyes shut, willing myself to wake up. But when I opened them again, the nightmarish scene remained.

In the distance, I could hear the wail of approaching sirens. Someone must have heard the gunshot and called the police.

I don't know how long I stood there, trembling and in shock, before the police arrived. Time seemed to slow and warp at impossible angles. The officers had to repeat their questions multiple times to break through to me, to get any semblance of an explanation from me about what had happened. But what could I say? That a man had handed me his credit card and then before my eyes his name had changed to my own, as if by sorcery, just before he took his own life? They would think I was mad, or guilty myself. 

So I remained silent, a helpless witness to this bizarre and gruesome tragedy. I didn't understand how any of this could be real or possible. There seemed no reasonable explanation for what I had seen, no way to make sense of the nonsensical.

Eventually the police cleared the scene, the coroner came to collect the body, and I was free to leave. I walked in a daze back to my car, questions still swirling in my mind. I pulled the credit card from my wallet again, now dry of any blood. John McGillicuddyâ€™s name once again greeted me, as if nothing strange had occurred. Had I imagined the entire bizarre incident? Had the horror of the moment caused some temporary insanity and delusion? 

There seemed no answers. Only the memory, burned into my mind, of a dead man on the ground, a credit card, and a trick of magic that couldn't possibly be real. I started the car and drove off into the night, chasing shadows of questions that would haunt me until dawn.
