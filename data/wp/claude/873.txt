The sickness spread through the village like wildfire. The Black Death, they called it. The horrible swelling of the lymph nodes, the blackening of the skin. Most died within a week. We thought we were the lucky ones who survived. 

Until the dead started to rise.

My brother was the first. We had buried him behind the house, sobbing as we said our final goodbyes. But that night we heard scratching and moaning coming from the grave. We found him, covered in dirt, his dead eyes glowing with a sinister light. He came at us, mouth agape, hungry for flesh. We fled in terror.

The whole village descended into chaos. The churned-up soil of the graveyard gave up its dead, spiriting away corpses into the night. Loved ones we thought we had mourned returned, shadows of their former selves, intent on feeding on the living. 

A group of us survivors barricaded ourselves in the church, hearing the shrieks of the undead outside and their victims. We prayed for morning to come, clutching whatever we could use as weapons. A few of our number ventured out to find food, never to return.

The monsters pounded on the doors, rattling the bars, their moans calling to us. We wondered how this could be possible, how the very dead we had buried with our own hands could rise up to haunt us. What strange demon had infected our town, turning the Black Death into a fate even more sinister than death?

Dawn finally broke, but it brought no comfort. The undead still roamed, and we knew this was only the beginning. The end was upon us. Death had found a way to rise again.
