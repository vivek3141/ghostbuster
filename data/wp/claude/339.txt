The guard escorted me to the cell. "Prisoner's asked for filet mignon, baked potato, and creme brulee for dessert. I shook my head subtly at the request.It was far too extravagant for a death row meal, against the rules—but today I couldn't care about rules. I looked through the bars at the prisoner sitting calmly on his cot, hands clasped, head bowed as if in prayer. John. As if sensing my gaze, he looked up, eyes locking with mine. A slight smile curled his lips.

Eight years. It had been eight years since he murdered my daughter. Eight years of waiting for this day, this final justice — yet now that it was here, I felt nothing but pain.My hands clutched the metal tray as I opened his cell door. His smile widened, eyes glinting with a peculiar spark of amusement. He sat down as I placed the tray on his lap, the perfectly cooked steak and steaming baked potato with sour cream, chives, just the way he liked. I made it all myself. It was shit, of course, but rules were rules. His line still had to be upheld, for dignity and compassion.

"Thank you, Marcus," he said, tearing into the steak like an animal. The flesh tore under his teeth. "As good as I remember," he said with his mouth full. Bile rose in my throat as I watched him eat, but I held back the urge to vomit from the overwhelming agony of memories flooding my mind. "How's Lisa doing these days?"

Rage blinded me. I lunged across the table and grabbed John by his collar, slamming him against the wall. My other hand formed a fist and punched his face over and over, blood spattering on the floor with each blow. Guards rushed in,pulling me off of him with difficulty, but the damage was done. John's face was a bruised and bloody mess, one eye swollen shut, lips split and dripping.

As they dragged me out, I stared into John's one good eye, feeling a grim satisfaction. "Goodbye, John," I whispered. His answering grin haunted me even as the door to his cell slammed shut for the final time.
