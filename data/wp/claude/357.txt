The Awakening 

Jenny opened her eyes as the morning sun filtered through the curtains. She yawned and stretched, her left arm reaching up to the headboard. But as she moved to rub the sleep from her eyes, she realised with a start that her right arm did not move. 

Panic rose in her chest as she looked down at the empty space where her right arm should be. She blinked hard, hoping it was just a dream, but when she opened her eyes, nothing had changed. Her right arm was gone.

Jenny started to hyperventilate. How was this possible? She had gone to bed last night with two arms and woken up with only one. Was she going crazy? Had she suffered some kind of psychotic break?

With her remaining left arm, she pinched her right shoulder hard. She felt the pressure and pain, confirming this was not a hallucination. This was real. Her right arm was missing.

A million thoughts raced through Jenny's mind. Was this some deranged prank? Had she been mutilated in her sleep? She threw off the covers to examine her body, but found no blood and no visible wounds. It was as if her right arm had simply vanished into thin air.

Panic rising, Jenny leapt out of bed and searched the room. She looked under the bed, in the closet, out in the hallway. But her right arm was nowhere to be found.  

Her heart pounding, Jenny realised she needed to call for help. She reached for her phone with her left arm, her fingers trembling as she dialled 911. When the operator answered, Jenny could only choke out a few words through her sobs: "Please...help...my arm is gone!"
