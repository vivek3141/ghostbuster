The Cabin in the Woods 

The old cabin sat alone in the forest, weathered logs aged and mossy. Anyone passing by would assume it was abandoned long ago. But inside, a fire crackled in the hearth.

Jenny had come to the cabin to escape. Her mind was filled with angry ghosts, memories of words spoken in haste, old wounds that refused to heal. She thought she could outrun the regret and anguish, lose herself in the tranquil woods.

At first, it seemed to work. The natural world soothed her frayed nerves. But soon the peace she found by day was shattered by nightmares each night. Her inner demons had followed her, and in the darkest hours they slipped their constraints.

Each night the cabin changed. Shadows grew deeper and more menacing. Half-heard whispers echoed through the rooms. Jenny would wake in a sweat, sheets twisted around her, pillow wet with tears. She started avoiding sleep, spending long hours by the fire trying in vain to quiet her mind. 

Eventually even the firelight wasn’t enough. The ghosts no longer waited for night to haunt her. In broad daylight, a specter with her sister’s face accused her from the corner. The floorboards creaked with the weight of memories beneath. Her personal Hell was no longer content to remain inside—it seeped into boards and logs, tainting the place with sorrow.

By the time Jenny left, she realized the cabin had become more than rooms and wood. It was a physical manifestation of the tormented space inside her heart, a reminder that there is no outrunning pain. She carried it with her, as inescapable as her own shadow. Her only choice was to turn and face it.
