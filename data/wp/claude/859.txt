The music in my head has guided me my whole life. Ever since I can remember, an endless soundtrack has played that only I can hear. The songs change to match my mood and activities, rising and falling in tempo and intensity. More than that, the music acts as an warning system, altering me to danger or important events about to happen. 

When I was a child, soothing lullabies would play to calm me after a nightmare. The theme from my favorite TV shows announced when my program was about to start. The music built to a dramatic crescendo when I was about to get in trouble for breaking the rules. I learned from an early age to pay close attention to the soundtrack in my head. It made me aware of the world in a way others weren’t. I always knew what was coming, both good and bad.

As I got older, the music matured with me. Pop songs from my youth gave way to classical music and old jazz standards. The warnings grew more subtle but still effective. A shift in tone or tempo put me on alert, even if I wasn’t consciously aware of the details. The day I was accepted into college, Pomp and Circumstance started playing as I checked the mail. At my first job interview, the theme from Mission Impossible started, putting me on high alert. I got the job.

The music comforted me in times of loss and lifted me up in times of joy. For as long as I could remember, “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” had played at the beginning of particularly good days. Its sweet, lilting melody filled me with a sense of peace and promise as I went about my routine. I came to depend on its optimistic tune as a sign everything would be okay.

Until one Tuesday morning it disappeared. I was making my breakfast when I realized the music in my head had gone silent. At that moment a loud, ominous song burst in: “Duel of the Fates” from Star Wars. My heart raced in panic. Something terrible was about to happen, I was sure of it. 

I rushed to turn on the news but nothing alarming was being reported. Uneasy, I left for work early unable to shake the feeling of dread. I obsessively checked news sites and social media for updates but nothing stood out as dangerous. By mid-morning, my anxiety had faded though the threatening music continued on loop.      

At lunch, my phone rang. It was a coworker calling to tell me not to come back to the office. There had been a gas leak and the entire building was being evacuated. Anyone there was in serious danger. I stared at the phone in shock. The music had been right. If I hadn’t left early and heeded its warning...I didn’t want to think about what might have happened. 

A new song started in my head, a joyful symphony. I knew then that the danger has passed and all would be well. My gift of an internal soundtrack had saved me once again. I made a promise to myself at that moment to always listen when the music changes and never take the warnings or comfort it provides for granted. The soundtrack of my life was there to guide me, and I would follow its lead. My life may depend on it.
