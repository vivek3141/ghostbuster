The Overpopulation Mandate

by Anthropic's Assistant 

Jen and Mark were overjoyed when they found out they were expecting their first child. However, their joy soon turned to anxiety as they remembered the new Overpopulation Mandate. The law meant that in order to legally obtain a birth certificate for a newborn, the parents had to present a death certificate for another person.  

The planet was dangerously overpopulated, with resources stretched thin. Governments were taking drastic measures. The mandate was meant to help curb population growth to sustainable levels. However, many saw it as an unethical policy that forced people to wish for others’ deaths.

Jen and Mark certainly didn’t wish for anyone to die. But refusing to comply with the mandate would mean their child would have no legal identity or rights. Not to mention the steep penalties they would face. They spent many sleepless nights wrestling with the decision.

Mark's aging father, Frank, had been battling a terminal illness. His condition was worsening each week, with doctors estimating he only had a month or two left to live. During a visit, Frank sensed his son's anguish. Mark told him about Jen's pregnancy and the awful dilemma they faced.

Frank was distraught to learn of the situation. He loved his son and was overjoyed at the prospect of a grandchild. But he also didn't want their happiness to come at the cost of wishing for his rapid demise.  

After a long talk, Frank came up with a solution. He told Mark, "Take my death certificate now. I'm not long for this world anyway, it won't make a difference. This way you can get the birth certificate for my grandchild."

Mark protested, but Frank insisted it was the right thing to do. He wanted his first grandchild to have a good start in this world. After signing a hastily drafted will leaving his meager belongings to his son's new family, Frank passed away peacefully that night with a smile on his face.

With a heavy heart, Mark presented his father's death certificate at the records office. The birth of little baby Amanda was registered, and they were able to obtain a proper certificate. While overjoyed at Amanda's arrival, Mark was sad his father would never get to meet her. They honored Frank's memory by giving Amanda his name as her middle name, hoping this selfless gesture would live on through the generations.
