Inspector Gadget re-checked the coordinates of the ISIS hideout and activated his helicopter hat to descend towards the desert mountains of Syria undercover of night. His mission was to infiltrate the terrorist group and gather critical intelligence. 

As Gadget landed near a cave entrance, his built-in motion detectors sensed two guards approaching. "Go go gadget arms!" he whispered, deploying a boxing glove to knock out one guard. He leapt over the other guard in a single bound and wrapped him up in a bola.

Gadget crept into the cave and used his periscope neck to peer around corners. His cybernetic eyes scanned for heat signatures and detected a larger chamber ahead filled with people. His digital ears picked up chatter in Arabic, confirming this was an ISIS meeting room.

When Gadget entered, dozens of ISIS members were seated, listening to a speech by a commander. Gadget's language module translated the speech: "Our latest attack killed hundreds of infidels. Now we plan to..."

Gadget gasped. He had to alert HQ immediately but couldn't blow his cover. "Go go gadget covert communicator!" A microscopic earpiece fell into his ear, patching him through to HQ. "Inspector Gadget reporting. I've infiltrated the target cave. Recording speech by ISIS commander now. Stand by for translation."

Gadget's eyes doubled as cameras, recording the entire speech. But as the commander continued, Gadget noticed one member glancing suspiciously at the new recruit in back with odd pink gloves and strange sounds coming from under his coat. Uh oh.

The member leapt up, pointed at Gadget and shouted in Arabic, "Spy! He's wearing gadgets! Get--" Before he could finish, Gadget sprung up. "Go go gadget net!" He captured a dozen ISIS members in a net. "Go go gadget skates!" Gadget sped around, dodging gunfire and tying up members left and right with bolas.

"Retreat!" the commander yelled. The remaining members fled as Gadget gave chase. But his cover was blown. Mission failed. Gadget sighted HQ for an emergency extraction as a barrage of missiles rained down, exploding the cave entrance. Gadget rocketed into the air, escaping just in time. Back to the drawing board.
