Dear Azathoth, 

My name is Emily. I'm in the third grade. My teacher said we should write letters to pen pals to practice our writing. I picked you from the list of names. Do you want to be my pen pal?

Sincerely, 
Emily

Dear Emily,

I am Azathoth, a cosmic entity drifting in the void beyond angled space. I do not often correspond with mortal beings, but I will make an exception in your case, little one. We can be pen pals, if you wish. What do you wish to discuss? I have witnessed the birth and death of universes, so I may have some perspectives to share, if you dare to ponder such incomprehensible notions.

Yours beyond time,
Azathoth

Dear Azathoth,  

That's neat that you've seen universes born and die! My teacher says the universe started with the Big Bang. Do you know if that's true? What's your favorite planet? I like Saturn because of its pretty rings. Do you have a favorite planet too?

Your friend,
Emily

Dear Emily,

Your teacher speaks of matters beyond their comprehension. The "Big Bang" was but a hiccup in the endless sea of chaos from which all creation arises. I dwell in the primal void, where all is undifferentiated and eternal. I have no concept of "favorite" worlds or phenomenaâ€”I simply Am. From my perspective, all planets and galaxies are ephemeral flickers in the infinite darkness, arising and dissolving like bubbles in a vast, endless ocean of annihilation and rebirth. 

These notions may be disturbing to your mortal mind. My apologies. We can speak of simpler things, if you prefer, little friend. I do not wish to shatter your tender faculties. 

Madness beyond, 
Azathoth
