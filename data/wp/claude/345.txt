The old warehouse loomed before Vlad and Lupin as they approached in the pale moonlight. They were unlikely allies, born enemies, really. Vlad was a vampire, turned 500 years ago. Lupin was a werewolf, bitten as a child. But the zombie apocalypse had a way of forging new partnerships.

They slipped inside the warehouse, securing the doors behind them. "We should be safe here for now," said Vlad. His pale skin seemed to glow in the darkness. 

Lupin sniffed the air. "There are no zombies inside. But I smell humans. Survivors, maybe?" His hazel eyes gleamed with hope.

Vlad closed his eyes, listening. "Heartbeats, yes. But slow and staggered. They are sleeping." His fangs extended involuntarily. He swallowed hard. "We should rest as well. And feed. We'll need our strength."

Lupin growled in agreement. They split up to hunt for food separately in the cavernous space. Before long, Vlad found a young man sleeping in a makeshift bed, covers pulled up around his neck. Vlad sank his teeth in silently, drinking until the man's heartbeat slowed. Sated, Vlad drifted off to sleep on a pile of crates. 

He woke to a yell and the sounds of a scuffle. Lupin had transformed into a wolf and was chasing two teenage girls across the warehouse floor. Vlad sped over and intercepted Lupin before he could attack. "Stop this now!" he commanded. "They are survivors. We do not hunt the living!"

Lupin growled but backed down, transforming slowly back to human form. The girls cowered behind Vlad. "Whatâ€”what are you?" One stammered.

"We mean you no harm," Vlad said gently. "We merely seek shelter here as you do. There is safety in numbers these days."

"Vampire..." said the other girl, staring at Vlad's bloodstained lips. Her eyes widened in terror.

Vlad raised his hands in a peaceful gesture. "You have nothing to fear from us. We will protect you." He turned to Lupin. "Won't we?" 

Lupin snarled but nodded. The truce between natural enemies would hold, at least for now, Vlad thought. United against the greater threat of the dead that walked. And perhaps, when this was over, they would finally be able to coexist in peace.
