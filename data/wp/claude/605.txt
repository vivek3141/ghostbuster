The Inferno raged through the city, leaving ashes and destruction in its wake. Captain Justice surveyed the damage from the air, his cape fluttering behind him. His archenemy, the Pyromancer, had gone too far this time. 

For years, the Pyromancer and Captain Justice had engaged in an intricate dance. The Pyromancer would start fires all over the city to sow chaos and discord. Captain Justice would swoop in and extinguish the flames with his ice breath before capturing the Pyromancer and handing him over to the authorities. The Pyromancer would then escape from prison, and the cycle would repeat. It was a constant battle of wills between the two, a battle that Captain Justice had come to depend on to give purpose to his immortal life.

But the Inferno was different. The Pyromancer had unleashed an unquenchable firestorm that ravaged half the city. Thousands of innocents had burned to death, their agonized screams still echoing in Captain Justice's mind. His ice breath had not been enough to contain a blaze of this scale and ferocity. All he could do was evacuate survivors while watching helplessly as the city was engulfed in the raging flames.

Captain Justice's blood boiled at the thought of the lives lost today. The Pyromancer had gone too far. This was no longer their familiar game of cat and mouse. This was murder on a massive scale.

He found the Pyromancer admiring the destruction from atop City Hall. "Quite the masterpiece, isn't it?" cackled the Pyromancer.

Captain Justice descended in silence, landing a punch that shattered the Pyromancer's jaw. He proceeded to pummel the Pyromancer, channeling his rage with each blow. 

"Why?" he growled. "Why did you do it?"  

The Pyromancer laughed through bloodied lips. "Because I could."

Those three words extinguished the last shred of mercy left in Captain Justice's heart. He grasped the Pyromancer's neck and froze his head instantly with his ice breath, watching impassively as it shattered into a million pieces. 

The age-old battle of wills between them was finally over. But at what cost? Justice had prevailed today, but Captain Justice wondered if there were any victors at all amid the ashes of the dead.
