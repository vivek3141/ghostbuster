The deadliest virus ever known to mankind started spreading like wildfire across the globe. Within a week, the WHO declared it a pandemic as nearly every country reported cases. They named it Virus X. 

Virus X was extremely contagious, spread through any contact, and had a 100% mortality rate within 3 weeks of infection. As cities started going into lockdown, panic arose and society started breaking down. There seemed to be no way to stop the spread.

A week after the pandemic began, I was working late in my home makeshift lab. I was a retired virologist, and wanted to do anything I could to find a cure. After many failed attempts, I had an breakthrough. I discovered a combination of three common ingredients that, when combined, formed a antidote. I gave it to mice I had infected with Virus X and they recovered fully. I could hardly believe my eyes.

I started making as much of the antidote as I could, but two of the ingredients were in limited supply. I only had enough to make 25 doses. I decided I would distribute this initial batch to key scientists and doctors around the globe so they could work to reproduce it on a mass scale. 

When my town went into lockdown, I snuck out at night to deliver the antidotes. Most roads were deserted, but military blockades and rioters made travel difficult. After a week of travelling and close calls, I had distributed all 25 antidotes to key individuals I thought could help replicate it fastest. I then returned home, hoping and praying my antidote could be mass produced before it was too late.

Two agonizing weeks passed. News reports continued to show society unraveling as deaths mounted. Then, one night my makeshift lab lit up with messages. The scientists I had sent the antidotes to were able to analyze it and find substitutes for the limited ingredients. They discovered they could produce not 25, but 25,000 doses. Distribution efforts began immediately across hotspots.

Over the next week, the tide started turning. Case rates started to drop. Although too late for millions, the remaining living were treated. Quarantines were lifted. Slowly but surely, Virus X was contained globally. 

My antidote was able to save humanity when all seemed lost. And it was all thanks to the noble scientists who, in the face of this deadly pandemic, were able to reproduce it and spread the cure. Our planet would live on.
