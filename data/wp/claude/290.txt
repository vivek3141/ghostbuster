The cold wind swept through the ruins of old Boston, but inside the small shack, Timmy was warm. His parents had a fire going and were readying for Christmas. 

"Tell me the story of Santa again, daddy," Timmy said. His father smiled and began the familiar tale.

"Long ago, before the war, there was a kind man named Saint Nicholas who would give gifts to all the good boys and girls. After the bombs fell, Saint Nick didn't forget the children of the Commonwealth. Once a year, on Christmas Eve, Saint Nick ventures out into the irradiated snow and visits every settlement and shelter. His pack Brahmin, Donner and Blitzen, lug sacks of toys and treats. For the nice children, Saint Nick leaves wonderful presents. For the naughty ones, only a lump of coal."

"But how does he visit everyone in one night?" asked Timmy. His father chuckled. 

"Saint Nick has a secret: His pack Brahmin can fly. They soar over the ruins, landing on each rooftop. Saint Nick drops down the chimney, or in our case through the old rusty blast door, and leaves gifts for the sleeping kiddos, before whisking off into the night sky with Donner and Blitzen."

"Wow," Timmy said in wonder. He gazed up at the hole in the ceiling, hoping to catch a glimpse of Saint Nick's Brahmin gliding by the moon. His father ruffled his hair. 

"Best get to sleep now. You want Saint Nick to come, don't you?" Timmy nodded and snuggled under the covers, dreaming of the flying Brahmin and the kind-hearted gift-giver of the Commonwealth.
