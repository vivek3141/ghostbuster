The First Date

Jenny was nervous about her first date with Mark. They had met on one of those dating apps and hit it off over text, bonding over their love of humor and adventure. Mark seemed funny and charming, and Jenny was eager to meet him in person. 

They agreed to dinner at an Italian restaurant downtown. Jenny arrived a few minutes early and got a table. When Mark walked in, Jenny felt a rush of relief - he was just as cute as his photos. He strode up with a smile and gave her a quick hug before sitting down.

"It's so great to meet you," Mark said. "I've been looking forward to this all week."

"Me too," Jenny said. The conversation flowed easily over pasta and wine. Mark made Jenny laugh with stories from his job and silly observations about life. She was really enjoying his company. 

As they perused the dessert menu, Mark leaned in conspiratorially. "I have to confess something," he said. Jenny raised her eyebrows, her curiosity piqued. He glanced around then spoke in a hushed tone. 

"Did I mention I'm an expert in explosives?"

Jenny burst out laughing. "What?" she cried, quickly covering her mouth. The surrounding diners glanced over at the outburst.

Mark's serious expression dissolved into a grin. "Just kidding. I wanted to see how you'd react to something completely ridiculous and unexpected."

Jenny shook her head, still chuckling. "You got me there. I was not expecting that at all!" 

Mark joined in her laughter. "I'm glad I could surprise you. Life is too boring without a little absurdity!"  

Jenny smiled, feeling a rush of affection for this playful, clever man. The rest of the date flew by, their conversation peppered with inside jokes and easy rapport. As Mark walked her to her car, Jenny felt sure this was the start of a fun adventure together. She was already looking forward to the next surprise.
