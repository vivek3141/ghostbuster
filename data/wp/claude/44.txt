It was another busy day at the office. My schedule was packed with house calls to fix botched spells and enchantments. Being a spell support technician is not glamorous work, but it's honest and pays the bills. 

My first call of the day was from Mrs. Abernathy, a kindly old witch who meant well but often got her charms mixed up. When I arrived at her cottage, I could see the problem immediately. She had been trying to animate her garden gnomes to help with yardwork, but instead had accidentally given her petunias the power of speech. They were loudly arguing and insulting each other. 

"Oh dear, I'm so sorry to bother you again!" Mrs. Abernathy exclaimed. I gave her a reassuring smile. A few counter-charms later, the petunias fell silent once more.

After solving some other minor magical mishaps around town, I paid a visit to Bob's Discount Magical Emporium. Bob meant well but his products were cheap and prone to malfunction. A woman had purchased a wand holster that made things vanish when she pointed at them, and had inadvertently caused her new couch to disappear. I reversed the holster's enchantment and her couch reappeared, good as new.

As night fell, my last call was to address a city block plunged into eternal daylight by a poorly worded sun spell. The witch who had cast it sheepishly agreed to lift the enchantment. All in a day's work. 

Being a spell support tech isn't a glamorous job, but I don't mind the challenge of solving problems and helping neighbors in this magical community. At the end of the day, I return home, tired but with the satisfaction of having fixed what was awry and made things right again. That is, until inevitably another frantic witch or overwhelmed wizard calls my emergency line for help once more.  Such is the life of a spell support technician.
