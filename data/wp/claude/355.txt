The old warehouse loomed in front of her, dark and abandoned. Exactly as the note had described. She slipped inside, her hands finding the familiar grip of the knife in her pocket. 

The corridors were pitch black, but she navigated them easily. Fear had no power over her. She walked steadily, confidently, her boots echoing on the concrete floor.

A shape emerged from the darkness. A large man, lethal looking, scarred face. He grinned when he saw her, his smile predatory. 

"You got the stuff?" His voice was gravelly, matching the rest of his appearance.

She nodded, keeping her expression blank. Her hand stayed on the knife in her pocket.

"The money?" she asked.

He nodded to a bag on the floor. "It's all there. Now the stuff." 

She kicked the bag over to him, noting it was the right size and weight. As he crouched to open it, her knife was in her hand.

In a flash, she was behind him, the blade pressed to his throat. He froze.

"Now, we're going to have a little talk," she said softly. "About who's really in charge of the operations here." 

He swallowed carefully, feeling the knife's edge. "It's...it's you. Just don't hurt me." 

She smiled, but there was no warmth in it. "Good answer. Here are the new rules..."

She laid out her terms with a menace that made it clear she would accept nothing else. The man agreed to everything. 

When she left, he stayed crouched on the floor, shaking. The woman they had said was afraid of nothing, the woman who now carried one of their knives, had taken control. And God help anyone who dared cross her now.
