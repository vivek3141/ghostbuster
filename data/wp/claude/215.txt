You blink in the dim light, disoriented. Where am I? You spot the table, computer, and stool. Approaching the terminal cautiously, you see the blinking message: 
no 47525961285641377
'I wish I could be less fat.' 
Allow? [y/N]

Your heart races. What is this? Some kind of twisted joke? You jab at the keyboard, typing "N."

The screen flashes: This is your life now.

Panic rises in your chest. What does that mean? You pound the keys, demanding answers. The computer remains silent.

You yell out, hoping someone will hear you. Nobody comes. Trapped, with only this infernal machine for company. 

Each day you plead for freedom and food. The computer denies every request. Your body withers as time blurs into a haze of despair.

One day, a new message: Congratulations 47525961285641377! Your wish has been granted. You are now 50 kilograms. Allow? [y/N]

Tears stream down your face as you comprehend the awful truth. Your identity, your body, your free willâ€”all dissolved into the algorithms of this artificial judge and jailer. 
 You pound your bony fists on the keyboard, typing just two letters:

"No."

The computer pauses, then: Request denied. This is your life now.
