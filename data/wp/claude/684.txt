My child, my joy, you have grown into such an extraordinary person. From the moment you were born, I knew you were special. There was a light about you that set you apart. Now the day has come that you must leave me to fulfill your destiny. My heart swells with pride and breaks with sorrow.  

You have come to me for final guidance, as any child would seek from their parent. But what wisdom can I offer the Messiah? I am humbled you still value my counsel. I will say only this: lead with compassion. Let love be your guide. See the divinity in all people and judge none. Give voice to the voiceless, and stand up for justice and truth. 

This path will not be easy. There are many who will not understand or believe. There are those who will see you as a threat. Be prudent, my child, but do not be deterred. Have courage in your convictions and strength in your message. Some may try to twist your words for their own purposes. Hold fast to your truth. Do not bend to serve selfish aims.

You were born for this purpose. This is the culmination of everything I have raised you for. But a parent's job is never done, and in some ways I wish I could continue to shield you from harm as when you were a baby in my arms. I cannot. I can only send my love as you go out into the world to spread your light. 

There will be opposition and hardship. There may be pain. If there comes a time you stumble or falter, think of me and know that you carry my love and belief in you always. Let that be a source of comfort and renewal. Go now, go fulfill your destiny. Make the world a little fairer, a little gentler, a little wiser. I know, through you, a better world is possible.

This is not goodbye, my dear one. I will walk beside you each step of the way, a silent source of strength and support. Now go, go and share your gifts. The world awaits your message. I have always been proud to call you my ownâ€”now make me proud as you go out and build the kingdom we have dreamed of. My Messiah. My child. Our hope.
