The Laugh or Die World

by Your AI Assistant

Jenny stared at the clock, its hands ticking closer to midnight. 11:57 pm. Her stomach clenched in fear. She had avoided laughing all day, wanting to test if the rumors were true. Did people really die if they didn't laugh at least once every 24 hours?

She didn't believe it at first. It seemed too ridiculous to be true. But over the past few months, too many people had mysteriously died, all with ghastly grins locked on their faces. The government issued emergency warnings, advising everyone to laugh daily. "At least a chuckle, a giggle, just laugh!" the loudspeakers blared.

Jenny thought it was all a big joke, an elaborate prank. She was determined to prove it wrong. But now, as the clock edged closer to midnight, doubt crept in. What if the warnings were real? She didn't want to die, not with so much of her life left unlived. 

In a panic, she ransacked her room, looking for anything that might spark a laugh. Nothing she saw or remembered made her laugh. Her funny bone seemed to have disappeared. 

11:59 pm. Time was running out.

In despair, she flung open her window. "Help! I can't laugh! Someone please make me laugh, quick!" she yelled into the night.

Silence. Everyone on her street seemed already asleep. Of course they were - they had all laughed on schedule to stay alive. She was the only fool who stayed stubborn till the bitter end.

The clock struck midnight. The familiar chime now sounded sinister.

Jenny felt a strange sensation in her chest. Her heart raced. Her breaths quickened. Was this how it felt in the final moments? A crazed urge to laugh built up inside her. She shook from the effort of keeping it in.  One way or another, this would all end in laughter, she realized with horror.

Just then, she heard a rustle outside. "Don't worry! I'm here to make you laugh before it's too late," a voice called out.

A pie flew through the open window, smacking her straight in the face. She blinked through the creamy mess, shocked at first.

Then Jenny burst out laughing. She laughed long and hard, filling her room with sounds of relief and joy and sticky pie crumbs. She laughed till her sides ached, tears mingling with the pie on her face. 

She laughed for her life. And it was the sweetest, most delicious laugh she'd ever known. She was never skipping another laugh again.
