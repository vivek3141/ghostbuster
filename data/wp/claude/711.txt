I opened my eyes to a blinding light. As my vision adjusted, I realized I was in an unfamiliar room.

"Welcome back," said a soothing voice. I turned to see a figure bathed in a warm glow. 

"Where am I?" I asked. "Am I...dead?"

The figure nodded. "Your time on Earth has ended. Do not be afraid. This is a place of reflection."

Suddenly memories flooded my mind. I saw myself as an essence, designing the attributes and skills of the life I was about to lead. I had optimized for intelligence and creativity but minimized attributes like discipline and patience. 

"I made so many mistakes," I said. The figure nodded again.

I saw how my lack of social skills had isolated me. How impatience and restlessness had led me to flit from goal to goal, never achieving my potential. How arrogance and ego had blinded me to opportunities to learn and grow. 

"I was unbalanced. I chose a life that felt clever in theory but was fundamentally flawed." I looked up at the figure. "I want another chance. I understand now. Please, let me try again with the wisdom I've gained."

The figure shook its glowingly head. "The choices you made were for that life alone. You cannot return to rectify them. But the insight you have gained will stay with you." 

The figure began to fade, and the room grew dark. Panic rose in my chest. 

"Do not be afraid," the figure's voice echoed. "You are moving on to design a new life. Apply what you have learned. Choose balance over extremes. Seek virtue. And above all else, pursue a life defined by love."

The room went dark. I felt a new world opening up before me as the figure's last words lingered:

"Now go, and live well."
