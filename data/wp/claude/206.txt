I was sitting at my desk, staring at my computer screen trying to figure out how to finish the essay that was due in a few hours. My concentration was broken by a loud crash coming from outside. I leaned over to look out the window, but couldn't see anything. A few seconds later, a blood-curdling scream rang out. 

My heart started racing. What was going on? Another scream, this one sounding like it was just a few houses down. I went to the front door and opened it slowly. My neighbor across the street, Mrs. Jenkins, was staggering down her front walkway, but there was something very wrong with her. She was limping and her arm looked broken. As I watched in horror, she turned and started shambling up my neighbor's lawn, emitting a strange groaning sound.

I slammed the door shut and locked it. My hands were shaking. Mrs. Jenkins was always so friendly and full of life. What I had just seen couldn't have been real. Maybe I was hallucinating from stress and lack of sleep.

A loud bang on the side of my house made me jump. The groans were getting closer. I ran to the phone to call 911 but there was no dial tone. I tried my cell phone but couldn't get a signal. 

Another bang, this time at the back door. A chorus of groans sounded like they were right outside. I realized with dawning terror that the town was under attack. The zombies were everywhere. 

I heard wood splintering as one of the doors gave way. Heavy footsteps thudded into the house, accompanied by snarls and moans.   I scrambled out of the room, locking doors behind me and shoving furniture in front of them. My only escape route was through the attic window onto the roof.

As I climbed out, jagged glass tearing at my hands, I saw the devastation all around. Nightmarish creatures filled the streets, attacking anything living. Blood stained the pavement and walls of houses. The world had descended into madness and there was no escape. I cowered on the roof, my future uncertain, listening to the chilling sounds of the zombie apocalypse. All I knew for sure was that my town would never be the same. The end was here.
