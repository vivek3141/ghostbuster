The old cobblestone path was familiar under my feet, though many of the stones were now cracked or missing. I walked down the overgrown lane, my steps heavy. So many times have I walked on ruins, the remainings of places that I loved and got used to. 

At first I was scared, each time I could feel my city, my current generation collapse, break into the black hole that thrives within it, I could feel humanity, the way I'm able to feel my body. The crumbling walls and decaying homes were a visceral reminder of the impermanence of all things. My kind. Our great societies and cultures, our art and music and stories. All eventually fading into the mists of time.

After the first few cycles of rise and fall, the pain was almost too much to bear. I wandered alone for decades, avoiding attachments or involvement, a lone watcher powerless against the forces of change. 

But after a few hundred years, the pattern became obvious, no longer the war and damage that would devastate me over and over again in the far past was effecting me so dominantly.. Birth, growth, decline, death. And from death, rebirth. The cities and civilizations I had so loved were gone, but new ones emerged and flourished on the ashes of the old. Humans evolved, adapted, and persisted.  

And so I adapted with them. I learned to celebrate the lives and moments, not mourn their passing. I chose to participate, to help guide new growth and pass down the lessons of the past, though still avoiding direct involvement. I watched friends and family live and die, generation after generation, but took comfort that the spark of consciousness never truly left the world. It simply took on new forms.

As I walked through the ruins of the once great city, empty for hundreds of years, I brushed my hand against a crumbling wall. Weathered by time but still standing, a silent witness like myself. Ruins they may be, but they held memories and meaning that shaped the future. The light of life may dim, but it never vanishes completely. Around another bend, fresh green shoots peeked up through the rubble, new growth already emerging from the old. And I smiled, life anew awakens. The cycle continues.
