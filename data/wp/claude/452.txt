I slumped in my seat, cringing as Mr. Thompson enthusiastically but incorrectly explained the themes of my novel to the class. If only he knew that I, David Miller, shy, unassuming high school junior, was actually the author of the bestselling sci-fi adventure novel, Chronicles of the Space-Time Rangers.  

Just last year, I had discovered a portal in my backyard tool shed that allowed me to travel through space and time. I had gone on many adventures with my friends, traveling to distant planets and even walking with dinosaurs. I wrote the book to share these adventures without revealing the truth of the portal and putting it in danger.   

The book was an instant hit, but the fame hadn't changed my daily life. I still had to endure the boredom of high school and teachers like Mr. Thompson.  

"The novel is a metaphor for the struggles of immigrants," he said proudly.

Nope. It's about adventure and friendship, I thought.

"The dinosaur scenes symbolize how we should connect with our primeval past." 

Wrong again. I just thought dinosaurs were cool.

 I sighed, tapping my pencil anxiously. His overanalyses and faulty theories were ruining the wonder and fun of the story for the class.  

The bell rang, and I rushed out of the classroom, wanting to escape before Mr. Thompson could ask me about themes I never intended. I comforted myself with the thought of the portal awaiting me, ready to transport me to new worlds and stories not yet discovered. The adventures were real, even if no one would ever believe the truth behind the tale. My secret was safe, even as my book remained, for everyone else, firmly in the realm of fiction.
