You are at home alone, browsing the internet. You hear the faint sound of a woman's cough from the room next to you.

You pause, fingers hovering over the keyboard. The cough sounded like it came from the spare bedroom next to the office you are in. But that's impossible. You live alone. You must have imagined it or misheard the sound. You shake your head and continue researching for your upcoming vacation, filing away possible destinations and attractions to visit.  

A few minutes later, you hear it again. A soft, stifled cough. Like someone trying to muffle the sound. You feel the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. Someone else is in the house. Your mind races through the possibilities. A burglar or intruder? But why would they be coughing? And the sound seemed to come from an empty room.  

You slowly stand up and walk to the wall adjoining the spare bedroom. You press your ear against it but hear nothing. Holding your breath, you open the door to the office and peek down the hallway. Everything looks normal. Doors to the other rooms are open, just as you left them. The house is quiet.  

You make your way down the hall, heart pounding in your chest. When you get to the spare bedroom door, you pause again and listen. Total silence. You reach out and push open the door. The room looks exactly as it always does. Unused bed neatly made, curtains drawn, a small dresser and lamp the only furniture. No one hiding in the corners or behind the door.  

You shake your head, feeling foolish. Your imagination was clearly playing tricks on you. As you turn to leave the room, you hear it once more. The soft, stifled cough of a woman, coming from the empty room behind you. You whip around but there's nothing. You stand frozen in place, stunned and uncertain whether you can even trust your own senses. 

A loud thump from downstairs startles you out of your shocked state. Someone is in the house. You race down the stairs, grabbing your phone to dial 911. But when you get there, a completely normal sight greets you. Your cat, who must have somehow gotten inside through her cat flap, is sitting on the floor playing with one of her toy mice that she just batted under the couch.  

You slump on the floor, adrenaline still coursing through you. There was no intruder. No mysterious coughing woman. Just an overactive imagination and a sneaky cat playing tricks. Your heartrate slowly returns to normal, as laughter bubbles up inside at your foolishness and paranoia. What an adventurous escapade, all without ever leaving your own home. You shake your head and make your way back upstairs, opening your laptop with the resolve to book that vacation. Some real adventure and a change of scenery is clearly in order!
