The dim light of the monitor flickered in the dark room as I sat hunched over my dusty keyboard. 4 long years had passed since the Great Social Media Exodus of 2016 when every major tech company was hacked and shut down, their user data erased. Reddit was the first to fall. 

Most people moved on, finding new ways to connect and share information. But I couldn't. Reddit had been my home, a place where I could be alone together. I learned, I laughed, I argued with strangers. It made me feel like I was part of something bigger.

So I kept this old computer running, waiting and hoping the servers might come back online. But day after day, the front page remained blank. The silence was deafening.

Then one night, as I sat scanning the page through bleary eyes, a single new post appeared at the top of /r/all:

[AMA Request] The Last Redditor

I stared in disbelief, my heart pounding. Could it be real? Or had isolation driven me to madness at last? With shaking hands I typed a reply:

I am the last redditor. Ask me anything.

For a moment nothing happened. Then a new message popped up:

Verified! Thank you for keeping the karma fires burning. Reddit is backâ€”and you shall be rewarded. Name your heart's desire and it shall be yours! 

I hesitated, blinking at the screen. A lifetime of wishes raced through my mind but one stood out above the rest. I took a deep breath and typed:

I wish to go back to the beginning. To start fresh and relive my glory days on Reddit when life felt full of possibilities and connection was just a click away. Can you take me back to the start so I can do it all over again?

Please stand by, the reply came. Resetting timeline. Returning to launch date. 

There was a blinding flash and suddenly the front page was full of new posts again. Reddit was alive! My karma score was zero but I didn't care. I had a second chance. Grinning from ear to ear, I rolled up my sleeves and began to browse new reddits, upvoting and commenting with abandon. The adventure was only just beginning. My name is u/[redacted] and I am the first redditor. AMA!
