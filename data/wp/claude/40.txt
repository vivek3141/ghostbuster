The mist rolled in quickly, swallowing the forest path in a thick grey cloak. Mark pulled his jacket tighter, a chill prickling his skin. This was no ordinary mist. 

He walked slower, hands extended in front of him, grasping at shadows in the haze. The familiar path felt strange, noises muffled, distances obscured. An acrid smell tingled in his nose.

A lone bird's cry in the distance pierced the fog like an alarm bell. Mark froze in his tracks, senses on high alert. The forest seemed changed, corrupted. Blurry figures danced at the corner of his vision but when he turned his head, nothing but the mist remained. 

His heart pounded as panic rose in his chest. He tried to stay calm and keep walking but his legs felt heavy and slow. The mist swirled and thickened, white tendrils caressing his face with icy fingers.

The sounds of the forest faded until only the thud of Mark's frenzied heart beating remained. An menacing presence lurked behind the veil of white, watching, waiting. His body tensed for danger but no threats emerged. 

Finally, the mist began to lift as quickly as it had descended. Relief washed over Mark as the familiar forest path returned. The sinister aura had vanished with the fog. 
 But it would not be forgotten. His walks home would never feel quite as safe, knowing there was no ordinary mist in those woods. The forest held mysteries unseen that could emerge again without warning.
