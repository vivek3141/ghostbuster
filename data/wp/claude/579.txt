The Golden Gate loomed before Officer Mark Stevens as he pulled up in his patrol car. He saw the lone figure standing on the edge of the bridge, looking down at the churning waters of the bay below. His heart seized up for a moment. This was never an easy situation, trying to talk someone down from the brink of suicide. 

He parked and slowly walked over, his hands raised to show he meant no harm. As he got closer, he saw it was a young man, no older than 25. His eyes were red from crying.

"Hey there," Mark said gently. "My name is Officer Mark Stevens. What's your name?"

The man looked over, startled at first. His body tensed as if ready to jump. Mark froze in place. "It's...it's John," the man said after a long moment. 

"John, I'm here to listen and help in any way I can," Mark said. "Would you mind stepping over the railing so we can talk properly?"

John shook his head violently. "No...no if I do that, I may not have the courage again."

Mark took a slow step forward. "Okay, I understand. We can talk like this. John, what's going on tonight? What has you thinking this is your only way out?"

John let out a shuddering sob. "My wife left me. She's been cheating on me for months. I just found out today. I thought we were happy, but I was living a lie. I don't know how I'll go on without her."

Mark nodded with empathy. "I'm very sorry to hear that, John. The end of a relationship, especially under those circumstances, is incredibly painful. But I promise you, the pain will become less sharp over time. Suicide is never the right choice, no matter the situation." 

John shook his head again. "You don't understand. I've lost everything. My wife was my whole world. I have nothing left." 

"You have your whole life left," Mark said firmly but gently. "I know it may not seem that way now, but you will heal and come out the other side of this. Please, step away from the edge. There are people who can help you through this."

A long silence stretched out. For a moment, Mark thought he was getting through. But then John let out another sob. "I can't...I'm sorry...I can't live without her." 

Before Mark could react, John stepped off the edge of the bridge. 

"No!" Mark screamed. He rushed forward but it was too late. John plummeted down, disappearing into the darkness of the night and the waters below.

Mark collapsed to his knees, overcome with anguish and regret. If only he'd said something different, done something else to convince John there was still hope and a reason to live. But his words had fallen on deaf ears. All Mark could do was kneel there alone, crying silently as the light of the Golden Gate Bridge shone coldly down.
