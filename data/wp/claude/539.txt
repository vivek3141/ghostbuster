The Zombie Apocalypse Arrived

The zombie apocalypse arrived not with a bang but with a moan. The first sightings were dismissed as drunk people stumbling home after a long night out. But soon the slurred groans and shuffling gaits multiplied. The hospitals and morgues started filling up with people who just wouldn't die. 

Within a week, the reanimated corpses were everywhere. But to everyone's surprise, they weren't attacking the living. They were casually strolling down streets, stopping in at coffee shops, and even sunbathing in parks. As long as you didn't provoke them, the zombies seemed content to leave the living alone.

Scientists scrambled to study the phenomenon. They found that the zombies were immortal, freed from the constraints of biology. They didn't need to sleep, eat or even breathe. They were impervious to harm. And without the distractions of responsibility or social inhibitions, the zombies seemed eternally carefree and pleasure-seeking. 

It soon emerged that the zombies were having a lot more fun than the living. They drifted from party to party, enticed by thumping music. They lounged on beaches, soaking in the sun for hours. Their unabated libidos led to wanton displays of affection and marathon bedroom sessions. 

As videos of zombie revelry went viral online, many living humans started to experience serious FOMO (fear of missing out). The immortal freewheeling lifestyle seemed increasingly alluring compared to the daily grind of school, work, illness and responsibility. People began actively trying to get infected, partying with zombies in hopes of joining their ranks.

Anti-zombie movements formed, preaching that undeath was unnatural and immortality overrated. But their warnings fell on deaf ears. Being a zombie was too exciting and too novel to pass up for many. 

Within a month, the majority of the population had willingly become zombies. They gave up jobs, families and responsibilities to do nothing but enjoy themselves. The world descended into an endless carnival of pleasure and delight.

A few holdouts remained, shaking their heads at the absurdity of it all. But as the months went by, even the most stubborn living humans couldn't resist peeking in on zombie nightclubs, beach parties and love-ins. One by one, they gave in to the temptation and embraced the carefree zombie life.

The zombie apocalypse arrived. And the zombies were having the time of their afterlives. The age of responsibility was over. The age of perpetual leisure and pleasure had begun. The zombies had inherited the earth, and it was nonstop fun for eternity.
