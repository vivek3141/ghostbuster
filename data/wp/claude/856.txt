The old warehouse loomed before me, abandoned for decades. I shuffled up to the rusty door and knocked hesitantly. After a few moments, the door creaked open.

"Oh, hey, Death. What's up?" asked the old man who answered the door. 

"Hey Bill, how's it going?" I asked awkwardly. Bill and I went way back, but this was always the worst part of the job. "So, uh, I was just in the neighborhood and thought I'd stop by."

" Come on in, friend," said Bill, ushering me into the dusty warehouse.  "Can I get you anything? I've got some provisions stashed away."

"No, I'm good, thanks," I said. How do you tell your old friend you were there to take his soul? I stalled, making some idle chitchat about the weather and what Bill had been up to since we last met. But after a few minutes, Bill gave me a knowing look.

"You're not really in the neighborhood, are you?" he asked gently. "You're here for me, aren't you?"  

I sighed, steeling myself. "I'm afraid so, Bill. It's...it's your time."

Bill nodded, seeming unsurprised. But his face fell as it sank in. "I always knew this day would come, but now that it's here..." His voice trailed off.

"I'm so sorry, my friend," I said softly.  "If there were any way around this, you know I'd do it."

Bill forced a smile. "I know, I know. You're just doing your job. And we had a good run, didn't we?" 

We shared memories of better days, laughing at stories of youthful misadventures from centuries past. But all too soon, a hush fell over us again.

"Will it hurt?" asked Bill in a small voice.

"No, my friend. I promise you won't feel a thing. It will be peaceful. Like drifting off to sleep." I tried to reassure him, though we both knew there were no guarantees.

Bill took a deep breath and squared his shoulders. "Well then, no point delaying the inevitable. Take me, Death."

I stepped forward and placed a bony hand on Bill's shoulder. His body fell away into dust and vapour. 

Only his soul remained, glowing brightly. "Is this it then?" asked Bill's soul. 

"Not quite yet - you have someplace else to be now," I said gently. I gathered up Bill's soul, holding it carefully as I prepared to transport it to the afterlife.

"Thank you for making this easier, old friend," whispered Bill's soul. 

"Goodbye Bill," I said softly. "Enjoy what comes next."

I turned away from the warehouse, Bill's soul in my arms, off to deliver it to eternal rest. My heart was heavy, but I took solace knowing Bill's suffering had ended and a new chapter was beginning for his soul. Though it was never easy, for old friends I tried to make the journey as gentle as possible. The life they led was done, but our friendship would carry on.
