The Halloween party was in full swing. I was enjoying posing for photos in my grim reaper costume, complete with black robe and plastic scythe. The host had gone all out with spooky decorations, and 'Monster Mash' was blaring from the speakers. 

As I ladled some punch into a cup, a voice spoke in my head, "I need a sick day, man, and you look like the perfect person to take my place. Your costume is almost perfect, after all."

I froze in place, punch dripping onto the table. What was that? I looked around but no one was paying me any attention. Had I imagined it?

The voice spoke again. "This isn't your imagination, mortal. I am the real reaper, and I need you to cover for me tonight. There are a few souls on my list to collect in this neighborhood. Just a quick in and out."

My heart raced. This had to be a trick. But what if it wasn't? "I...I can't kill people!" I said under my breath. 

An ominous chuckle filled my mind. "I'm not asking you to kill anyone, fool. I collect souls at the appointed time of death. I simply need you to use my scythe to sever their lifelines when their time is up. Their deaths are destined to happen with or without your...assistance."

I struggled to comprehend this bizarre turn of events. I was being asked to fill in as a substitute Grim Reaper? Ridiculous. Yet a sinister feeling crept over me as I considered the possibility that this was real.

"Two houses down on the left, an old man will pass within the hour," the reaper instructed. " simply use the scythe to cut his lifeline when I tell you his time has come. Do this for a few souls, and your debt will be repaid. You get to live, and I get a day off. Simple."

My heart pounded as I stepped onto the front porch of the house the voice indicated. This has to be a trick, I repeated to myself. But my clammy hands gripped the scythe tightly. 

An hour later, I returned to the party in a daze. I had seen an old man take his last breath as I swung the scythe in his bedroom. But it wasn't really me...was it? I shook off the chilled feeling of dread and reminded myself there had to be a logical explanation. Probably someone's idea of an elaborate Halloween prank.

The voice returned one more time that night. "Well done, mortal. Enjoy the party. We shall meet again next Halloween. Happy haunting..." The sinister laughter echoed before fading into the sounds of music and chatter around me.

I tossed and turned all night, unable to shake the feeling I had been visited by something not of this world. And its haunting promise - that "we shall meet again" - rang in my ears long after the sun rose the next morning.
