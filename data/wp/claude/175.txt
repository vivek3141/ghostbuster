The old dragon gazed at the sunrise, her amber eyes glowing. She felt weary of this world and longed for the peace of the afterlife. 

A young farmboy, Jorah, hid in the bushes, filled with excitement and fear. He had discovered only recently that he possessed a strange ability - he could take control of dragons' minds. He connected with the old dragon's consciousness and began to see through her eyes, feel the warmth of the sun on her scales.

The dragon shook her head in confusion as she felt the boy's presence in her mind. Jorah sensed her weariness and aching bones. On an impulse, he urged the dragon to take flight for the first time in decades. The dragon obeyed and spread her enormous wings, launching into the air.

Jorah gasped as he found himself soaring high above the world through the eyes of the beast. The dragon let out a roar of joy as she glided on the wind currents, her tiredness evaporating. 

Though only for a brief moment, boy and dragon had given each other the gift of freedom and youth. The dragon landed gently, her heart swelling with gratitude for this mysterious visitor. Jorah crept away in awe of the wonder he had experienced, and the power that lay within.
