The Cruel Gift 

I was born on a day of unspeakable tragedy. The Magnus Massacre, they called it. Over 10,000 lives extinguished in a single night by a terrorist attack. A dark day that broke the hearts of millions around the world.

Yet for me, and two others, it granted a cruel gift. Magic is real in this world, and your magical ability is determined by how many died on the day before your birth. An awful cosmic joke - those with the strongest magic were born of humanity's deepest sorrows.

The three of us were legendary for our power. Governments and organizations vied for our allegiance, dangling wealth and glory in front of impressionable eyes. Some called us monsters, abominations who never should have been allowed to live. They were not wrong. 

Thomas was the first to break, unleashing fiery hell on a crowded shopping mall, burning hundreds of innocents. He was put down like a rabid dog. The world celebrated the death of such a wicked soul.

Ava tried to use her power for good at first. But the temptation slowly corrupted her, the urge to bend the world to her will grew too strong. Her well-intentioned interventions spiraled into tyranny. She had to be stopped, though at a terrible cost. 

Now only I remain, clinging desperately to my humanity. But each day the darkness grows stronger, whispering seductive promises of power unlimited. My magic twists my mind, fuelling paranoia and egomania in equal measure. I have fled to the most isolated corner of the world, but I cannot outrun what is inside me.

The Magnus Massacre gave me this curse disguised as a gift. A power that will ultimately consume all that I am, leaving a monster in my wake. The only way to end this plague upon the world is to end my life before the final vestiges of my conscience fade away.

Forgive me, mother, for the sorrow I have brought you. Forgive me, world, for the evils I may yet commit if left unchecked. There must be no more monsters born of humanity's darkest days. This story ends now, with my flame extinguished, and the cruel gift returned to the abyss that spawned it. The Magnus Massacre will claim one final victim. And the world, at last, will be safe from my magic.
