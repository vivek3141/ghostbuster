The old book cracked open, its pages crumbling yet still emanating a forbidden knowledge. As Jai scanned the words hungrily, his palms began to sweat. This was it - a first edition Bradbury,  pristine condition. Any collector would pay a fortune for this artifact from the past. 

Yet as the story enveloped his imagination, he couldn't help but pause to savor the texture of the paper and the musky scent of the binding. His clients paid extra for that sensory experience that could only come from physical books. But now Jai understood why.

He knew he should sell this immediately and retire from the bibliodealing business for good. His profits could set him up comfortably for years. But the ideas springing from these pages were too intoxicating to let go.

As Jai finished the tale, he realized with dismay that he had become just another addict seeking a fix of paper and leather and ink. His future was crumbling as surely as the brittle pages he now clung too tightly to extract their pleasures and insights. The book had trapped him as cleverly as it had ensnared any other reader and made a bibliophile out of a bibliodealer. The ultimate irony, he thought, then smiled ruefully and began to read again.
