Google search: How to tell if someone has been poisoned 

Reddit post: My roommate has been acting strangely the last few days. Slurred speech, confusion, dizziness. They claim to feel fine but I'm really worried. At first I thought it was just stress or exhaustion but now I'm afraid it might be something more serious. How can I tell if these are symptoms of poisoning or a medical issue? Should I take them to the ER?

Text to 911: Please come quickly. My roommate collapsed and is unconscious. I think they may have been poisoned. I'm afraid they're not breathing steadily. Hurry, I'm so scared. 

In the end, the roommate who claimed to be locked out and then supposedly got better was actually systematically poisoning the other roommate by increasing the carbon monoxide levels in the apartment. The Google searches and Reddit posts were desperate attempts by the poisoned roommate to determine the cause of their worsening symptoms. The texts to the locksmith, landlord and 911 at the end reveal the frightening truth.
