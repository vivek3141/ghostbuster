My roommate Jenny was an art major and always had some painting or another going in our tiny shared studio apartment. Usually, I didn't mind, and occasionally I found her works rather interesting. One day, though, I came home to find her latest work was spread out over the entire living room, covering the worn hardwood floor and the walls.  

"Jenny, what is all this?" I asked, cautiously stepping over a glob of red paint as I set my bag down.

She looked up at me, her eyes wild, a streak of yellow across one cheek. "It's my final project for advanced studio art. I have to fill a 'space' with a 'visceral and emotive response to the human condition.'" She waved her hands dramatically as she spoke the last few words.

I blinked, taking it in. Our living room was splattered in angry splotches of color, chaotic and disorienting. "Uh, mission accomplished?" I said. 

Jenny let out a tense laugh. "You think? I don't know, I wanted to do something really thought-provoking and impactful."

"It's definitely...impacting," I said as I wiped a few drops of errant paint from my glasses. 

Over the next couple of days, the art project took over more of the apartment. Our tiny kitchen and hallway were soon fair game, the riot of colors and patterns spreading like a virus. I could barely find a path to walk through the maze each evening, and had taken to eating all my meals out to avoid the creeping paint fumes.

Finally, the night before Jenny's project was due, I emerged from my paint-free bedroom to find she had covered over my closed door and the entrance to the bathroom with her peculiar brand of art. An uneasy feeling gripped me.

"Jenny, don't you think this has gone far enough? We need to use the bathroom and leave our rooms!" I said, my voice rising in panic.  

She turned around slowly, her eyes glassy and feverish, hands spattered in a dozen colors. "No, it's not done yet. The human condition is messy and chaotic, and this space needs more. More color, more feeling!" She turned back to the wall she was coloring in uneven patches.

I stared at her in disbelief tinged with fear. Jenny had clearly become obsessed and unhinged in her artistic fervor.  I pulled my phone out and dialed 911. 

The police arrived shortly, surveyed the scene in bewilderment, and then had to peel Jenny away from her out-of-control art project. As they carefully led her out of the apartment, now a riot of colors from floor to ceiling, I started wondering if I needed an entirely new roommate and a fresh coat of white paint. My devoured living space stood as a visceral reminder that sometimes art and madness live in close proximity. I vowed the next time Jenny started a big painting, I was heading to a hotel.
