The old warehouse was in flames, the fire raging as the fire trucks arrived. But this was no accident. I started that fire, to destroy the evidence of what really happened. To cover my tracks, eliminate any trace of my presence here tonight. As the flames erupted around me, I slipped out the back into the darkness, rushing home as sirens echoed in the distance.

24 hours earlier

"You need to do this, Tom. We're counting on you." The voices on the phone were insistent. I didn't want this burden, this responsibility that could change everything. But I owed them. After years of working together, of having each other's backs, I couldn't say no.  

That's how I found myself staking out the warehouse that night, waiting for the familiar blue van to appear. The one that made deliveries once a month, always late at night when the streets were deserted. I didn't know exactly what was in those crates they moved into the warehouse. I didn't want to know. The less I knew, the better. Plausible deniability, that's what they called it.

At midnight, right on schedule, the blue van pulled up to the loading dock. Two men got out and opened the back doors, unloading heavy wooden crates onto a pallet. I waited until they had moved the pallet inside, then slipped through the side entrance and broke into a jog toward the van. My heart pounding in my chest, sweat dripping down my back already. I didn't know how long I had until they came back out.

Catching my breath, I peered into the open back doors of the van. Two crates left. I swallowed hard and scrambled inside, prying off the lid of one crate. And stared in shock at what was inside. This changed everything. I realized in that moment I couldn't go through with this plan. I closed up the crate again and was about to get out of the van when I heard voices approaching.

"Who's in there? What are you doing?" The two men had returned. There was no more time. I lunged out of the van as they grabbed at me, stumbling to my feet and running full speed into the maze of warehouses, my pursuers close behind. If they caught me, it was over. All I could think of was evading them, escaping this place as alarms began to sound and lights flickered on in the buildings around me. 

I burst through a side door and into the darkness of the warehouse, desperately looking for a way out, a place to hide. But it was a dead end. All that
