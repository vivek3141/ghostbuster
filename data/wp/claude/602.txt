Each year the USA government closes out a year from the past. When they do, all crimes committed that year are wiped clean. Criminals may now confess their crimes without punishment. You've been making the headlines for decades.  

The old diner was empty except for a lone figure at the counter, nursing a cup of cold coffee. His wrinkled face was etched with the years of his long life. Most of those 87 years had been lived on the wrong side of the law. 

John “The Knife” Macready had been the most notorious mobster in New York for decades. His ruthless ambition and sharp intellect had built a criminal empire that spanned the eastern seaboard. The police had been trying to take him down for over 50 years, but John was always one step ahead.

Now the years were catching up with him. His empire had crumbled, his loved ones were gone, and death loomed. But there was one last thing John needed to do.

The waitress refilled his coffee with a sympathetic smile. She was one of the few who knew why John came here every year at the same time. It was his yearly ritual, a solemn purge of sins from a life of unimaginable darkness.

“Another year ready to close, Mr. Macready?” she asked gently.

He nodded. The government was about to wipe the slate clean for crimes committed in 1957. And that year had been a bloody one in John’s long memory.

At the stroke of midnight, John began to speak. He confessed to the murders of two rival mobsters, shot in a warehouse 57 years ago. To bribing half the NYPD to cover his tracks. To threatening a dozen witnesses into silence. His gravelly voice held no remorse, only the cold recitation of long-buried facts. 

The waitress listened in silence as John purged his soul under the cover of darkness. He spoke through the early hours of the morning, revisiting decades of misdeeds in these annual confessions.The diner was a time capsule where the past lived again, if only for a single night.

Dawn broke as John finally finished, exhausted but unburdened for another year.  His worn body would not withstand many more of these nights. But as long as he still drew breath, John would make this yearly pilgrimage and lay his sins bare. Not for absolution, but merely to speak the truth that had been held silent for so long.

The waitress squeezed his gnarled hand as John paid the meager bill, leaving her a generous tip as always. “Next year, Mr. Macready,” she said softly. He nodded, hoping in his heart that he would return.

John emerged into the breaking light, waiting for his driver to take him home. The slate had been wiped clean again. But though his crimes were erased in the eyes of the law, they would live forever in his memory. And so the ritual would continue, as long as there were sins left to confess.
