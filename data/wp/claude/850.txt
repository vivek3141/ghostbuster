The old miser lay on his deathbed, clutching a velvet sack filled with gold coins—his life's treasure. His nephew, the only family he had left, pleaded with him again.

“Uncle, you can't take that with you. Please, let me call the doctor.” 

The old man coughed, shaking his head. “I'm not giving up one single coin, boy. This is my life's work. I earned every piece of gold in here through years of sacrifice and toil. It's mine!”

His nephew sighed and left the room.

As the miser's breaths grew shorter, a dark shadow appeared by his side. “Well, well, you were right. You CAN take it with you.” The hooded figure held out a bony hand.

With his last ounce of strength, the miser sat up and poured the gold into the figure's hands, grinning. His work was done.

The figure chuckled. “Indeed you can take it with you. But in the afterlife, gold no longer holds any value. You have chosen a velvet sack of useless metal over friends, family, and salvation. Your gold will now be your eternal burden—and your torment.”

The miser's anguished scream echoed as his soul descended into the fiery depths, doomed to wander forever with his sack of worthless treasure.

Turns out you CAN take it with you when you die. But some things lose all meaning once you cross over—and a life spent pursuing vanity and greed will lead only to suffering. The miser learned this truth too late. Some burdens are eternal.
