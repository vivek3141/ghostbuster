The old man shivered as he walked down the empty street at night. The dim streetlights illuminated the pavement ahead of him but showed nothing behind. No dancing shadow trailed his steps. 

He turned a corner and passed by a darkened storefront, catching a glimpse of himself in the glass. But where his reflection should have been, there was only inky blackness staring back. He shuddered and walked on.

Many years ago, the old man had been vain and cruel. He cared only for surface pleasures and never bothered to gaze beneath the surface at the darkness of his soul. One night, a mysterious stranger visited him and cursed him for his superficiality and selfishness. As punishment, the stranger stripped away the old man's shadow and reflection. 

Without those shadows and reflections, the old man at first felt liberated. But soon he descended into loneliness and isolation. Friends shunned him, frightened by his strange curse. He could not bear to look at himself in any mirror, seeing only a hollow, empty void. 

The old man spent long years wandering the world in solitude. He searched for meaning and purpose beyond mere material pleasures. He sought to rediscover his own humanity.

Finally, on a quiet street corner, the old man gazed up at the stars glimmering in the inky sky above. And in that sea of darkness, he found a dim light kindled once more in his chest. His heart, long shrouded in selfishness, opened itself to beauty in the world.

The old man smiled softly. Though still without a shadow or reflection, the light within at last gave him a sense of inner fullness and peace. His curse was lifted. The darkness no longer terrified him.
