The old world order persisted. The sun never set on the British Empire. King George VII ruled over a quarter of the globe from London, as his forefathers had for centuries.

Yet unease stirred in the farthest reaches of the realm. Rumors spread of secret meetings, coded messages,  and whispered plots. The stirrings of liberty and self-rule wafted through the imperial corridors of power like a chill breeze.

In the muddy streets of New Delhi and the verdant hills of Kenya, in the bazaar stalls of Cairo and the red-brick towns of Australia, resentment simmered.The heavy boot of Empire had stamped for too long. The old chains of colony and dominion rattled to breaking point.

In London, the Ministers and Generals paid the rumors no heed. The Empire was eternal, immutable as the stars themselves. Their hubris blinded them to the awakening of humanity and spirit across four continents. 

When the storm broke, it struck like lightning: the Revolt of the Colonies began. Independence was seized in a single bloody week that shook the Empire to its core. The old order was torn asunder. The age of Empires was no more. A new age, of freedom and self-rule, dawned at last for half the world's peoples. The sun set on the British Empire for the final time. Liberty's light banished the shadows of centuries. A new world stirred to life.
