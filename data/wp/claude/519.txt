The Mark of Death 

Jenna sighed as she looked at the dark mark on her forearm. It had appeared overnight, a black smudge in the shape of a skull. Her time was up.

She knew what this meant. The Grim Reaper could no longer take lives directly. Instead, he marked those whose time had come, and it was now the duty of friends, family, even strangers to end that life upon seeing the mark. She had killed before in service of this duty. And now her turn had come.

Jenna locked the door to her apartment and drew the blinds. She wanted time to think. Her boyfriend Mark would be over soon. She considered not letting him in, avoiding all human contact until...until what? There was no escaping this fate. Once the mark appeared, your life expectancy was a matter of hours or days at most. Someone would notice eventually. And they would do their duty.

A knock sounded at the door. It was Mark. Jenna took a deep breath and opened the door. This was it. She walked into his arms, hugging him tightly.

Mark's breath caught in his throat as he saw the mark on Jenna's forearm. His eyes welled up with tears even as his hands tightened around her neck to do his duty. 

Jenna didn't struggle. She gazed into Mark's anguished eyes. "It's okay," she managed to say as his hands squeezed the life from her. She didn't blame him. He was only doing what was required. Her last breath escaped her body, even as Mark sobbed, his tears falling onto her peaceful face.

The black mark started to fade from Jenna's arm as her soul left this world. Mark gently laid her body on the ground and walked out of the apartment in a daze. His duty was done, but at a terrible price. His beloved Jenna was gone, another life claimed not by the Grim Reaper himself but by a fellow human, compelled to kill on sight. Such was the way of the world now. No natural endâ€”only a black mark to signify the end had come.
