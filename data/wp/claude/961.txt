The early morning sun filtered through the blinds as I sipped my coffee. The house was quiet, the day full of promise. I decided to go for a walk in the park nearby. 

I put on my shoes, grabbed my phone and headed out the door. The park was empty except for a few joggers and the birds chirping overhead. I found a bench under a large oak tree and sat down. A squirrel scampered down from a high branch, startling me.

EDIT: I left the park and headed to the coffee shop down the street. The aroma of fresh brewed coffee filled the air. I ordered a muffin and a refill and found a cozy armchair by the window. The street outside bustled with activity as people rushed off to work and school. Such industrious energy made me grateful I had the day off. 

EDIT: After another cup of coffee I ventured out into the busy street. Cars and buses streamed by as pedestrians wove through the crowds. The sounds of the city mingled into a low roar. I didn't have a destination in mind, so I just walked while my thoughts wandered freely.

EDIT: The walking and fresh air eventually made me hungry. I popped into a deli, the little bell on the door jingling as I entered. Behind the counter, a man sliced meat while chatting with the customers. I bought a sandwich and some chips and sat down.  Classic rock played from an old radio on the counter, completing the scene. 

In one short day I had a peek into the lives of the squirrel in the park, the barista at the coffee shop, the strangers on the street, and the deli man. My wanderlust sated for now, I headed home under the glow of the setting sun, feeling grateful for the little details that made up my day.
