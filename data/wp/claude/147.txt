The deep blue mark around my wrist had been there for as long as I could remember. According to the old legends, the color of your mark indicated the personality of your soulmate, the one person in the world meant for you. Blue was said to signify a soulmate who was kind, creative, and thoughtf  ul. 

Ever since I turned 14, the age when the marks typically appear, I had stared at the blue band around my wrist and wondered who in the world had the matching mark. What were they like? Where were they? Would I ever find them? My friends had started finding their soulmates, recognizing them instantly by the matching marks, but my blue band remained unchanged.

One Friday night, a group of us decided to go out to the movies. My mark was the usual deep shade of blue, still holding onto its secrets. After the movie ended, we decided to walk over to the nearby ice cream shop, chatting and laughing the whole way. 

That's when I first noticed the strange looks. A few people glanced at my wrist with expressions of confusion, even shock. Puzzled, I looked down at my own mark—but there was nothing there. Just bare skin where the familiar blue band always was.

My heart started pounding as I rubbed at my wrist, but no mark appeared. It was really gone. How was this possible? Marks didn't just disappear. They were supposed to stay until you found your soulmate. 

A cold feeling of panic started to spread through me as the realization hit. The disappearance of a mark could only mean one thing—that my soulmate was gone. 

"What's wrong?" my friend Jenny asked, noticing my expression. Wordlessly I held up my bare wrist. Her eyes went wide.

The mood of the group instantly changed. My friends were stunned and upset on my behalf. These marks were such an integral part of life and identity. To lose your mark, to lose your soulmate before ever finding them...it was a grief and sorrow like no other.

I barely said a word the rest of the night. My mind kept spinning in helpless circles. Who were they? What had happened to them? Why did I never even get the chance to find them? The unknowns made it somehow even worse. My perfect match, my soulmate, was out there somewhere—only now the thread connecting us was gone forever. 

The pain in my chest made it difficult to breathe. All I could do was rub at my bare wrist, hoping desperately that at any moment the mark would reappear. But as the hours passed, I knew the truth. My mark was gone. My soulmate was gone. And now an empty space was all that was left behind in my heart where hope had always been.
