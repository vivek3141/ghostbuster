The old oak tree stood silent, its brittle leaves rattling in the cool October breeze. Below its branches, a boy named Timmy huddled close to his grandfather, both gazing up at the crisp night sky, ablaze with stars.  

Timmy shivered, pulling his coat tighter. The evenings were getting cold in the hills of New England. But tonight was special. His grandfather had woken him after dinner, insisting he bundle up quickly. They trekked out past the barn to the edge of the meadow, Timmy's excitement mingling with confusion.

Now Timmy understood. His grandfather pointed up, hand shaking slightly. "There," he said softly. 

A bright light slid smoothly across the sky, like a lonely traveler making its way through a sea of stars. Timmy gasped. He had seen airplanes before, but this was different. It shone brightly, then faded as it moved.

"It's Sputnik," his grandfather said. Timmy gazed at his grandfather in awe. They had listened on the radio as the Soviets launched the world's first satellite earlier that week. His grandfather chuckled at Timmy's expression. "I wanted us to see it together, where there are no city lights to spoil the view."

Timmy grinned, his eyes glued to the sky, following Sputnik's path as it glided silently eastward. His heart swelled. He slid closer to his grandfather, wrapping his arm around the old man's waist. They stood that way for a long time, watching until Sputnik finally vanished over the horizon.  

His grandfather ruffled Timmy's hair. "Quite a sight, wasn't it?" Timmy nodded, unable to find the words. 

The walk back to the farmhouse was quiet but joyful. Timmy's mind raced with the wonder of what he had witnessed. His grandfather too seemed deep in thought.  

As they entered the yellow glow of the porch light, his grandfather stopped and knelt, facing Timmy. "Son, I want you to remember this night." His eyes glinted with memories of his own under the starry sky. "We live in remarkable times. Man has achieved something I never dreamed possible in all my years."

He grasped Timmy's shoulders gently. "Promise me you'll never stop dreaming. Never stop reaching for the impossible. Can you do that?"

Timmy gazed into his grandfather's familiar eyes, seeing him anew. He nodded solemnly. "I promise."

His grandfather pulled him into a fierce embrace. They clung to each other, the generation that came before and the one that would come after, under a sea of stars that now held a bright new dream.
