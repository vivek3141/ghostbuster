The light faded around me as I took my last breath. An endless expanse of white surrounded me. In the distance, two options floated in the air:

New Game+ 
Exit to Reality

I blinked, confused. Was this some bizarre afterlife or was I hallucinating in my final moments? As I gazed around, a booming voice spoke:

"You have completed your life. You may now choose to start a new game with increased difficulty or exit to reality. What is your choice?"

A new game? Like reincarnation? But with a harder difficulty? Exit to reality seemed tempting but what did that even mean? I had so many questions. 

"What do you mean by a 'new game+' and 'exit to reality'?" I asked the voice.

"New Game+ means starting a new life with greater challenges and obstacles to overcome. Your knowledge and wisdom from this life will remain intact but circumstances will be more difficult. Exit to reality means awakening from this simulation and returning to your true existence outside of the game."

My mind reeled. A simulation? My life had been some kind of game? None of this made any sense. 

"How do I know what to choose if I don't understand what's going on?" I asked. 

"I cannot give you all the answers," replied the voice. "You must make a choice based on the information provided. Choose New Game+ for further challenges and mastery in this world. Choose Exit to Reality for enlightenment and understanding of the true nature of existence."

The options remained, floating in the air, taunting me with a choice I didn't feel ready to make. If life had been but a simulation, did anything I achieved actually matter? But what if it wasn't? What if this was some trick and my life's work still held meaning?

I thought of the people who would mourn my passing, the goals left unachieved, the relationships cut short. Perhaps in my next "game" I could build deeper connections, pursue more meaning, really achieve my purpose, if I only chose New Game+. 

Yet the thirst for knowledge and truth pulled me towards Exit to Reality. What secrets of existence lay behind the veil of this world I called life? What greater understandings could be reached? Every fiber of my being yearned to comprehend the reality beyond.

The voice did not rush me but the longer I lingered, the more I felt I must choose. Each option represented a gamble - the risk of losing meaning and purpose or the risk of limiting my understanding forever. 

Finally, I took a metaphorical breath and spoke: "I choose Exit to Reality. I must know the truth, whatever may come of it."

"So be it," said the voice. 

The whiteness around me began to dissolve into a blinding light that flooded my senses. An explosion of insight, comprehension and pure transcendence erupted in my mind. In an instant, I understood the meaning of reality and my place within it. 

The light faded to reveal a familiar face - my own - staring back at me. I blinked away a tear, overjoyed at being awake again yet mourning the loss of understanding from that place beyond. 

A nurse smiled down at me. "Welcome back. The surgery was a complete success. You may have some existential thoughts as the anesthesia wears off, but those will fade. It's good to have you here - your family will be so relieved."

I gazed around the hospital room, overjoyed at being alive yet profoundly aware life would never again be the same. The secrets of reality may have slipped from my grasp but one truth remained: every moment was a gift and every day, a new opportunity to play the game.
