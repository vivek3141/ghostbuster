The Defender soared over Mill City, his keen eyes scanning the streets below for any signs of trouble. His enhanced senses allowed him to hear the faintest cries for help, spotting the smallest infractions of the law. 

As he flew over the West Side Industrial Park, something caught his attention. A flash of glowing green at the FirstBank Chemical Plant. He swooped down for a closer look and saw a figure in a billowing emerald cloak blasting away at the metal drums stacked outside one of the factories. Chemicals were spilling onto the ground, a toxic soup seeping into the drains that fed the Mill City River.

"Halt, villain!" The Defender landed with a thud, shaking the earth. "Cease this wanton destruction at once."

The green-cloaked figure turned, hands glowing with power. "It is you who should cease, Defender. This factory is illegally dumping chemicals into the river, poisoning our water supply. I am the Avenger, and I fight for justice."

"As do I," said the Defender. "But justice must operate within the confines of the law. I have seen no evidence this factory has violated its permits. Your actions here today are unlawful, however well-intentioned. Stand down now, or I will be forced to stop you."

"Then you leave me no choice." The Avenger turned and blasted the Defender with a burst of energy from his hands, knocking the hero off his feet. The Avenger then returned to destroying the chemical containers, sending their hazardous contents spilling across the ground. 

The Defender rose and launched himself at the Avenger, tackling him to the ground. They rolled around, trading punches, neither gaining the upper hand. As noxious fumes began to fill the air from the broken containers, the Defender pleaded with the Avenger once more.

"Please, see reason! This is not the way. If this factory has truly done wrong, we must find lawful evidence and pursue proper legal channels. Taking the law into our own hands will only lead to chaos."

The Avenger snarled. "By then the damage will have been done. How many more must suffer while we waste time with legal maneuvers and loopholes?" He blasted the Defender again, breaking free from his grasp, and turned to destroy what remained of the chemical storage. 

Bruised and battered, the Defender knew he had only one choice left. He grabbed the Avenger from behind and activated the teleporter on his belt, transporting them both out of the Industrial Park to the Defender's hidden sanctuary in the mountains. 

The Avenger struggled in the Defenderâ€™s grasp. "Release me! I must finish what I started."  

"I cannot do that," said the Defender. He pulled back his mask, revealing a tired but kind face. "But I give you my word we will investigate the FirstBank Plant together. We will collect evidence and build an airtight case against them if they have indeed broken the law. We must uphold justice and protect our city, but through moral and lawful means, not violent vigilantism."

The Avenger's shoulders slumped. "I only wanted to help. But you are right, Defender. My methods today were...unworthy of the title 'Avenger'. I will follow your lead in this matter." He pulled back his own mask, showing the face of a young man new to his powers and his role as a hero. 

The Defender smiled, clapping a hand on his fellow hero's shoulder. "Come. Let us change from the costumes of warriors into attire more fitting for scientific detectives. We have work to do." Side by side, the two heroes set off to defend their city in the light of truth and justice.
