The phone rattled on the countertop, vibrating so violently it nearly tipped over. Mark froze in place, dish towel in hand. That phone hadn't rung in monthsâ€”not since his mom had passed away. 

With a shaking hand, he picked it up. "H-hello?"

"Mark? It's Mom."

The phone slipped from his grasp, clattering to the floor. Impossible. His mom had died of cancer three months ago. He vividly remembered visiting her in hospice, holding her frail hand as she took her last breath. 

Yet here was her voice, as familiar as always, ringing out from the phone at his feet.

He knelt down and retrieved it. "Mom?" he croaked.

"Yes, it's me. Did you drop the phone? I heard a loud bang." Her tone was light, oblivious. As if she hadn't just torn his entire world asunder with a single word.

"I, uh, I..." He trailed off, at a loss. This couldn't be real. Had he finally lost his grip on reality, as he feared he might after weeks of numbly going through the motions of life without his mother?

"Mark, are you there? Did I lose you?" 

"I'm here, Mom." The words came unbidden. He knew, logically, that this was impossible. But he couldn't stop himself from clinging to the fantasy. Just to hear her voice again...

"Oh, good. I was worried when I didn't hear from you yesterday. Everything okay?"

"Yesterday?" Nothing was making sense. He had spoken to his mother every day until she died. Yesterday, he had visited her grave, not spoken to her. "Mom, I...I'm confused. Are you...how are you calling me?"

A long pause. "What do you mean? I'm calling from the hospital. The doctors said I can come home in a couple of days since the treatments went so well."

Treatments? Mark's head spun. His mom had opted out of aggressive treatments, choosing hospice care instead to make her final weeks as comfortable as possible. 

"Mom, you didn't have any treatments. You...you died. Three months ago."

Silence. When she spoke again, her tone was fearful. "Mark, I don't know what kind of cruel joke you're trying to play, but it isn't funny. I'm right here in the hospital, waiting to come home. The doctors said I'm going to be fine."

Mark's eyes flooded with tears. He longed for that to be true. But he knew it wasn't. 

His mom sighed. "I think the medications they have me on must be making me confused. We'll talk when I'm home and thinking clearly, okay?"

The call ended with a click. Mark gripped the counter for support as a wave of dizziness washed over him. That conversation was impossible. He must be losing his mind.

Over the following days, Mark questioned everything he thought he knew. He called his mom's doctors, only to find she hadn't been a patient of theirs for years. He visited her grave, but the dates on her tombstone matched his memories, not what she had said on that eerie phone call.

A week later, the phone rang again. This time, Mark steeled himself before answering. 

"Mom?"

"Hi Mark." Her familiar warmth filled him with comfort and despair.

"Mom, I don't understand what's happening." His voice trembled. "You died. You're gone. But you keep calling me." 

"Oh, Mark, I'm so sorry. I never meant to confuse or hurt you. The truth is...I don't know how these calls are happening either. I'm not really here, as much as I wish I was."

Mark sniffed, fresh tears falling. "I just miss you so much."

"I know. I miss you too. But I need you to know that I'm at peace. And although I can't explain these calls, they're my way of telling you that I will always be with you."

A warmth he hadn't felt in months spread through Mark's chest. He smiled through his tears. "I love you, Mom."

"I love you too, Mark. More than you'll ever know. Be happy."

The call ended. Mark wiped his eyes, no longer questioning his sanity or the impossible reality of speaking with his late mother. Although he knew the calls likely wouldn't continue, he felt comforted in a way he hadn't thought possible again. And he knew, without a doubt, that his mother would always remain with him.
