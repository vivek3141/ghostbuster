The genetic modifications had started slowly at first, under the guise of improving health and longevity. Eliminate diseases, strengthen the body and mind. But over generations, the changes accumulated and diverged. The original humans would not have recognized their descendants. 

Some branches of humanity developed gills and webbing to dwell in the seas and lakes, escaping the overpopulated land. They pioneered underwater cities and a new civilization. Others developed poisons and toxins, not unlike insects, as a defense mechanism. Their mere touch became deadly to outsiders. 

A fringe group focused on regeneration like the lizards of old. They could regrow limbs and heal wounds that would prove fatal to their unmodified ancestors. But in the process, they became something no longer quite human, more a human-lizard hybrid.

The governmental programs that had instigated these changes so long ago lost control of the subjects of their experiments. Different groups objected to modifications they saw as unnatural and against human purity. There were uprisings and wars between the factions, between those who embraced the new forms humanity had taken and those who railed against meddling with human evolution.

Countless lives were lost in the process. But in the end, there were too many who owed their very existence to the genetic changes their ancestors had undergone. An uneasy peace settled over the land. 

Purity of form meant little in a world irreversibly changed. Humanity had diverged into a spectrum of beings, from those nearly indistinguishable from the old humans to those who had taken on the traits of the creatures around them. For better and for worse, this was now the natural order of things on Earth. A new normal for a humanity that was human no longer.

The old humans would not have understood how their world had come to be inhabited by such fantastical and bizarre beings. But we had survived, adapted as needed to a changing world that could no longer support humanity in its original form. And in that, there was a kind of hope for the future after all. A future very different from the past, but a future nonetheless.
