I stood in front of the crowded lecture hall and straightened my robes. As the new professor of Basic Undead Lore at the Arcane University, I was eager to make a good first impression. However, one glance at the wildly varied students told me this would not be easy. 

In the front row sat a group of fresh-faced necromancers, eagerly awaiting their first lesson in reanimating corpses. A few rows behind them were paladins in gleaming armor, sent by the Church to monitor what spells were being taught. Scattered throughout were the dark-robed warlocks, slouching in their chairs, while a cluster of stern witch hunters glared at the warlocks. An eclectic mix, to say the least.

I cleared my throat. “Welcome students, to Basic Undead Lore. I am Professor Mirriam. Over this semester, I shall teach you the fundamentals of necromancy as well as the identification and destruction of undead creatures.”

The necromancers perked up at this, while the paladins and witch hunters murmured their discontent. I raised my hands to quiet them. 

“While you all may have different reasons for taking this class, the basics remain the same. We shall start with the anatomy and reanimation of a basic skeleton.”

Groans rose from the paladins and witch hunters. I ignored them and launched into the lesson. The necromancers listened with rapt attention, eagerly taking notes.

When the lesson ended, I said, “For homework, you must identify the six steps to raise a skeleton, and list the runes required. We shall put a skeleton together next week.”

The necromancers rushed forward, thanking me eagerly. The paladins stormed out, already composing a letter of complaint to the Dean. The witch hunters lingered, sizing me up with suspicion. A warlock approached, gazing at me through strands of greasy black hair.

“A clever deception, professor,” he rasped. “Teaching the holy warriors a bit of the dark arts. I look forward to seeing how far you dare go.” He gave a mock bow and swept out.

I sighed, collapsing into the chair behind my desk. My first lesson was complete, yet I felt only a mix of apprehension and uncertainty. Teaching students of wildly different—and opposing—fields of magic would be no easy task. I could only hope I did not end up at the center of an all-out magical war within the University halls. The line between educating students and corrupting them would be very thin. I said a quick prayer to the gods, asking for the wisdom and guidance to walk that line successfully.
