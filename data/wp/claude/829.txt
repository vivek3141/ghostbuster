The engines of my scout ship screamed as I hurtled towards the blue planet below. Some sort of magnetic anomaly had disabled my controls and guidance system, sending me spinning out of orbit and plummeting into the atmosphere. As the hull started to glow red hot, I braced for impact. 

With a deafening crash, my ship skidded across the surface, gouging a massive trench through a forest and kicking up clouds of dirt and debris. When it finally ground to a halt, the cockpit was crushed and darkness overtook me.

I awoke with a start. Emergency power had activated, and the backup life support systems were barely functioning. I could feel pain throughout my body. When I looked down, violet blood was seeping from multiple wounds. My exoskeleton was cracked in places. I knew I was dying.

But my mission was not over. I had to warn the High Council about this planet. My scout ship’s logs and samples all indicated this world was teeming with life. Intelligent life. Dangerous life.

With shaking claws, I activated the emergency transmitter. “Mayday, mayday. This is Scout 671. I have crash landed on the third planet from the star. The inhabitants...they are not to be underestimated. They are...consummate survivalists. Violent and cunning. My mission has failed. I will not be returning home. But you must be warned...do not engage these creatures. Do not land on this world. Theywillseeyouasathreatanddestroyyou. Avoidthisplanetatallcosts. The humans...cannot be trusted...they are dangerous...savage... Stay away...”

My warning delivered, I slumped back in my command chair and gazed out the shattered cockpit window at the twin moons rising over the alien landscape. The long night was descending on this hemisphere of the planet, but I would not see the dawn. I had completed my final task. My people would be safe. The High Council was warned. My sacrifice would not be in vain.  

In the distance, I could hear the roar of primitive ground vehicles approaching. The humans must have spotted my smoldering wreckage. They were coming to investigate, their natural curiosity and aggression driving them to confront the unknown. 

I sighed, feeling the twin hearts within my thorax slowing as my lifeblood continued to spill out. But a sense of calm came over me, knowing I had done my duty. My name and this warning would live on, even as I closed my eyes for the last time. The humans were coming, just as savage and dangerous as I had warned. But my people would survive and thrive, steering clear of this little blue world and its dominant apex predators. My mission was accomplished. I had warned them about the humans.
