The coffee shop was bustling as Maggie hurried in to escape the pouring rain outside. She was already late for her meeting and flustered as her wet coat dripped onto the floor. Looking up, she saw a young man waving at her and gesturing to the front window. She made her way over, wringing out her coat along the way. 

"Maggie?" the man said with a smile as she approached. "I'm Mark. We spoke on the phone about the graphic designer position."

Maggie sighed in relief. "Wonderful to meet you, Mark. I apologize for my lateness and disheveled state." She extended a hand which Mark shook warmly. His grip was strong and confident. 

"No need to apologize," Mark said, handing her a napkin for her rain-soaked face. "This weather is dreadful. Please sit down. Can I get you a coffee or tea?"

"Tea would be lovely, thank you." Maggie sat as Mark went to the counter to order drinks. She smoothed her wet hair and tried to compose herself. From a first impression, Mark seemed charming and chivalrous. And rather handsome. 

Mark returned with two cups of tea and sat across from Maggie. "So, do tell me about your background in graphic design," he said, leaning forward with interest. 

Maggie launched into her experience, qualifications and passion for design work. Mark listened intently and asked insightful questions. Before long, two hours had passed in engrossing conversation. Maggie found Mark's enthusiasm and humor irresistible. The feeling seemed mutual based on Mark's lingering gaze and bright smile each time she spoke.  

As Maggie was describing her creative process, she noticed Mark reach hesitantly across the table toward her. She placed her hand in his, thrilling at his touch. Perhaps this could be the start of something more than a job opportunity.

Just then, Mark's phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen and muttered, "Excuse me a moment." He stood and walked toward the restrooms still reading the phone.

Maggie sat back, feeling slightly bewildered by the intensity of their connection in such a short time. But also excited at the possibilities. She decided to check her own phone when a message from her friend Jenny appeared.

"How did the interview go? Did you meet the charming Mark I mentioned?" 

Maggie froze in confusion. Interview? The only Mark she had met was the graphic designer. A chilling realization set in as she scrolled up to find a series of messages she had missed earlier about a vetted matchmaking candidate named Mark who was suggested as a romantic setup. She had unwittingly stumbled into a date, thinking it a job interview. 

By the time a sheepish Mark returned to confess the confusion, Maggie's heart had closed. The poetic justice of the situation was not lost on her - two strangers feeling the fairy tale spark of love at first sight only to have it snuffed out just as quickly by farce and false pretenses. She smiled bitterly at Mark. "I think this 'date' has ended, don't you?"  His face fell as she gathered her things and walked out into the rain, leaving behind a cold cup of tea and the memory of what might have been in another time and place.
