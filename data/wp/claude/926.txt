The gates of Purgatory loomed before me, vaulting up into the hazy sky. My sins had condemned me to 1,000 years of repentance, the longest sentence ever given. 

The gates creaked open and I was shoved through. A desolate, gray landscape stretched out. Shackles materialized around my wrists, chains linking me to heavy stone blocks. My task was simple: haul these burdens behind me as I trudged across the wasteland. The blocks were enchanted to match my stamina, always just light enough to drag but burdensome.

The first century passed slowly. The shackles chafed my skin raw. My muscles burned with fatigue. Each step required immense effort. I focused on putting one foot in front of the other, churning through the repetitive movements. As I walked, ghostly visions appeared around me, replaying my worst moments in life. I watched again and again as I inflicted pain, betrayed trust, gave in to temptation. With each scene, my guilt grew.

Two centuries gone. Three. Five. The visions continued but I was numb to them now. My back was bowed from hauling the blocks. My thoughts revolved around only the walk, the next step, the next century to pass. The wasteland never ended; it folded in on itself.

After 700 years, my anger at my sentence flared. I had repented; wasn't that enough? When would these burdens be lifted? I screamed and ranted as I stumbled on, fury fueling my pace.

In the 800th year, acceptance came. My sins had been great; my punishment was justified. I found small beauties in the wasteland, a flower here, a sunrise there. My steps lightened. The blocks seemed less heavy.

The 900th year passed peacefully. My journey was almost over; what remained was not a burden but an opportunity for atonement. I gave silent thanks for Purgatory's harsh mercy.

When the gates opened before me as the 1,000th year ended, tears of joy and relief streamed down my face. I emerged from Purgatory and as my shackles dropped away, a jubilant cry escaped my lips. Heaven's light warmed my face. I had survived my sentence and now this angel's eternal reward was mine. The wasteland had stripped away my sins and refined me, and as I entered the Kingdom of God, born anew, I knew no more perfect joy. I was home.
