The old Victorian mansion loomed over the hill, shrouded in mystery. For years, the townspeople whispered about the strange happenings and eerie noises coming from within its boarded up walls. I have stood silent for decades, harboring the secrets of my ghostly inhabitants who continue their eternal routines and wander the dusty halls and rooms. 

In the dead of night, a scream pierces the air. The police receive an anonymous call reporting suspicious activity at the abandoned house. At last, my era of being left alone is at an end. The police cars arrive with sirens blaring, stirring my ghosts from their shadowy corners. Doors slam and floorboards creak as they scramble to avoid the mortal interlopers trespassing into our realm.

The police officers enter through the front entrance, blinded by darkness. Their flashlights barely penetrate the black shroud covering the old furnishings and peeling wallpaper. An unearthly cold chills them to their bones. They call out a greeting and warning, receiving only eerie whispers in reply.

Deep within my skeleton, two young spirits huddle together in the cupboard they once called their nursery. The ghostly visage of their nanny stands guard, waiting to console them after the strangers leave. In the master bedroom, the specter of the lady of the house hides her face in grief over the loss of her babies so many years ago.

The officers have found nothing out of the ordinary but cannot escape the feeling of being watched by something not quite human. Doors open and slam behind them as they leave in haste. I remain, housing the sorrowful souls of those who came before in this haunted edifice of wood and stone. The living may come and go, but here I still stand, a silent sentinel of the past amidst a sea of whispers in the night.
