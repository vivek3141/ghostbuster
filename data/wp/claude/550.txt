The red dust swirled around John as he took his first step onto the rust-colored soil of Mars. After decades of training and a perilous 9 month journey through the inky black void of space, he had finally achieved his dream of becoming the first human to set foot on another planet. 

As John eagerly explored the surface and set up the equipment for the colony mission, a sudden piercing pain shot through his spacesuit. An oxygen tank had ruptured, flooding his suit with the unbreathable Martian atmosphere. John collapsed to the ground as warning sirens rang out from the spacecraft behind him.

When John opened his eyes, the rust-colored landscape was gone. In its place were rolling green hills and twin suns shining in a pink sky. His spacesuit had disappeared and he found he could breathe freely. 

A figure approached in the distance, moving gracefully over the verdant Martian landscape. As it drew closer, John could see it had distinctly human features, yet its body seemed to be made of the same red dust that covered Mars.

The being spoke: "Welcome John. We have been waiting for the first pioneer to join us. This is Mars Heaven, where the souls of those who perish on the red planet may find eternal peace in a familiar yet perfect world."

John gazed in wonder at the twin suns as they set over the lavender horizon, grasping the truth that he would never return home. Yet as the first soul in this new paradise, he had once again made history by exploring where none had gone before. Mars would be his final resting place, but what a resting place it was.
