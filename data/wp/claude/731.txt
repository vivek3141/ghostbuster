The world was dull and gray as far as I could remember. My parents told me that color didn't exist,  that it was a myth, a fantastical concept found only in stories and legends. Everything was shades of gray, black and white. 

I was walking down the busy city street, weaving through the crowds as per usual. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Then suddenly, a stranger bumped into me, our hands grazing for just a brief second.

In that moment, my world exploded into color. Vibrant reds, bright blues, sunny yellows - colors I had only dreamed of surrounded me. My senses were overwhelmed trying to take it all in. I gasped, staring at the floral print of a passing woman's dress, the ruby red of a sports car zipping by.

But when I turned to the stranger who had brushed against me, the source of this wonderful gift of color, he just looked confused. He muttered a quick "sorry" and hurried on his way. I called after him but he didn't turn around. 

My heart sank as I watched his gray figure disappear into the crowd. The world remained colorful around me, but now felt dull without someone to share it with. The colors seemed to mock me, reminding me of the connection I had gained and lost in a fleeting moment.

I walked home, the colorful yet gray world seeming empty around me. My parents looked the same as always, decked in blacks and whites and grays. Their eyes didn't light up with the colors they had never known. I realized with a pang that they would never understand. They would never see the beauty surrounding them that was now so painfully clear to me.

The stranger had unlocked my world with one accidental touch, then vanished without realizing the gift he had given me. I was left with a sea of color around me but an absence of the one person I wanted to share it with. My soulmate, the only one meant to open my eyes, was lost to the gray crowds and I wondered if my world would ever be bright again.
