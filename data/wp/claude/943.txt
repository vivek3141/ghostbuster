The streets of Lavender Town were empty at this hour. Ash hugged the shadows, Pikachu at his heels, as they made their way down the alley towards the old Pokémon Tower. His heart raced. If they were caught, it would mean the end of his journey. 

As the duo entered the tower, an unsettling chill filled the air. "Pika..." Pikachu whispered, sparks flying from its cheeks. The tower had been abandoned for years, but recently strange noises were heard coming from within its dilapidated walls.

They slowly climbed the creaking stairs to the top floor. A loud crash made Ash jump. In the room ahead, a dark figure hunched over a table, muttering to itself. 

"The resurrection will soon be complete. The souls of fallen Pokémon will inhabit these cloned bodies, and my army will be unstoppable." The figure turned, noticing Ash. It was a scientist, fanatical eyes gleaming. "You should not have come here, boy!"

He released a horrific creature—it looked like Charizard, but its eyes glowed an unnatural red. "Destroy the intruders!" The scientist laughed maniacally. 

"Pikachu, thunderbolt now!" Ash yelled. Pikachu unleashed a massive electric shock, but the creature absorbed it unfazed. 

It swatted Pikachu aside with its spiked tail and turned to Ash, jaws open wide. "No, stop!" Ash cried, stumbling back. 

The creature's roar echoed through the tower as it enveloped Ash in flames. The scientist's laughter was cut short. "What have I done?" he whimpered, fleeing into the shadows and leaving the tower in flames behind him.  

In the forest below, Ash's charred hat drifted to the ground. An era had ended. Team Rocket had won.
