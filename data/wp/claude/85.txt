The old Pope had passed away unexpectedly. As the College of Cardinals gathered to elect a new Holy Father, a series of unfortunate events unfolded. 

The mailroom clerk accidentally delivered the message summoning me, a humble parish priest, to the conclave instead of the intended Cardinal. Assuming there had been a mistake, I went anyway out of curiosity and politeness. Upon arriving, I was ushered into the deliberations before I could protest.

The lengthy process was proceeding in secret when one elderly Cardinal stood up and proclaimed, “God has chosen this man as a sign to lead the Church in a new direction!” To my horror, he pointed at me. I tried to object but was hushed. Before I could rally an explanation, a vote was called.

To my shock, I won a majority and was named Pope. I was immediately clothed in the papal robes and presented to the world. At a loss, I blessed the crowd and retired as soon as possible to figure out what to do. 

Summoning the Cardinals, I began, “There has been a terrible misunderstanding...” But I was cut off. “Your humility does you credit, Your Holiness, but you were chosen by God and your fellow Cardinals. It is time to lead!”

I called my bishop and parish, only to discover they had already received the news. "Will there be any problem replacing me?" I asked sheepishly. My bishop chuckled, "Following God's will, how could I stand in the way? Congratulations, Your Holiness!"

It became clear I couldn't back out without causing scandal. The only choice was to embrace this accidental calling. For better or worse, I was now the Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church. I prayed for wisdom and grace.

At the inauguration, I promised to do my best in this new role, relying on faith that this improbable turn of events was meant to be. Perhaps an ordinary priest was what the Church needed. I proclaimed my papal name as Hilarius I, hoping at least to bring some humor and goodwill to my accidental papacy. And so began the reign of the reluctant Pope, foisted upon the throne of St. Peter by a comedy of errors and a dose of divine providence.
