I couldn't believe what I was seeing. The news report showed incredible footage of a chemical plant explosion, with the journalist getting it all on camera from multiple angles. At first, I was impressed with the footage and journalism. But then something strange caught my eye. In two of the shots, I noticed the journalist's reflection in a window, holding a different camera in each shot. Yet the footage was presented as if from a single camera. 

My curiosity piqued, I dug into the journalist's previous news reports. There were many examples of impossible footage, capturing events from multiple angles that didn't make sense for one cameraman to get. Unless...no, it couldn't be. But the conclusion crept into my mind nonetheless. This journalist could see into the future and was using that ability to always be at the right place at the right time to get the most gripping news footage.

At first, I was in awe of the ability and craft of the journalism. But then the ethical implications hit me. This journalist knew about these tragic events before they happened but did nothing to prevent them or warn anyone. He was standing by solely to get the best news shots to further his own career. 

I felt sick to my stomach. I debated what to do with this disturbing realization. Part of me wanted to expose the unethical behavior. But without hard evidence, it would seem like a baseless accusation. And even if proven true, there were deeper issues to grapple with regarding changing events that hadnâ€™t happened yet.

In the end, I decided to have an off-the-record meeting with the journalist. I laid out my concerns and observations without revealing I knew his secret ability. At first, he denied everything and accused me of being a conspiracy theorist. But I countered every point calmly and rationally, and I could see him start to buckle under the weight of the moral implications. His self-justifications crumbling, he finally admitted the truth. A tear rolled down his cheek as he considered all the suffering he could have eased or prevented. 

We talked for hours about journalistic ethics and the responsibility that came with his ability. I saw in him a quest for fame and glory, but also a desire to report the truth and shape the world for the better. It would take time, but I believed he could learn to balance the two and use his gift virtuously. Over the years, incidents of perfectly captured footage of tragedy dwindled. And new kinds of news reports began to emerge, featuring never-before-seen stories of hope, courage and wonder from around the world. My efforts had made a difference, all thanks to a journalist who could see the future.
