The excavation for the new skyscraper was going as planned until the workers struck something hard. As the foreman peered into the hole, he saw a strange crystalline object, glowing with an odd inner light. His curiosity got the better of him. He reached down to brush away more dirt and get a better look.

As soon as his fingers touched the crystal, a surge of energy shot up through his arm. In that instant, he sensed there was something magical and ancient about this relic they had uncovered. But the sensation lasted only a moment before fading. Perplexed, he shook off the feeling and ordered his crew to extract the object carefully so they could continue digging. 

Over the next few days, strange events began happening on the construction site. Equipment and tools would go missing, only to turn up in odd places with no explanation. Accidents became more frequent. Tempers flared and fights broke out over petty slights and disagreements. The foreman noticed a disturbing change in himself as well. His thoughts grew darker, more suspicious and paranoid. His men seemed different too, their personalities contorting in various ways. It felt as if a malign influence was spreading among them, twisting their minds and souring their spirits.

By the end of the week, the foreman realized with dawning horror that all these strange occurrences had started after they unearthed that peculiar crystal artifact. Its magic, once disturbed, had awakened and was now manipulating them in insidious fashion. He knew they had to get rid of it before its wicked power spread further.

That night, he returned to the site alone. In the moonlight, the crystal pulsated with sinister light, as if detecting his presence. Fighting his growing dread, the foreman grasped it and hurled it with all his might into the concrete foundation pit. It shattered into a thousand fragments, its unearthly glow winking out at last. 

The next day, the strange events ceased. His men returned to their usual good-natured selves, no longer under the crystal's malevolent spell. Though the relic's magical power had vanished, the memory of its baleful influence lingered in the foreman's mind. He gave thanks that they had destroyed the ancient evil before it was too late. Construction continued as the crystal's shattered remnants were buried forever in the skyscraper's deep foundation.
