The old clock in the corner struck midnight with a loud chime. Emma sighed, rubbing her eyes as she leafed through yet another stack of parchment. As a junior associate at the Magical Law Offices of Abernathy & Grimsby, late nights had become routine. But on this moonlit Tuesday evening, staying late felt particularly tiresome. 

All of Emma's friends from Hexroot Academy were likely out celebrating Walpurgisnacht, the ancient wizarding festival marking the arrival of spring. Instead of dancing around a bonfire and tasting exotic potions, here Emma was, reviewing decade-old case files in the empty office. The only warmth came from a few enchanted lamps and the smoldering remains of coals in the hearth.

As the clock finished tolling the hour, Emma's eyelids grew heavy. She knew from her History of Magic lessons that midnight was the witching hour, a time when magic was at its peak. All manner of strange enchantments and mystical creatures were abroad at this time. 

Emma's head drooped onto the stack of papers, her eyes closing at last. She began to dream of warm firelight, laughter, and a melody played on panpipes. The music grew louder, beckoning her to dance. She twirled with abandon under the silvery moon as her friends clapped along. 

A loud crash jolted Emma awake. She sat up with a start, papers sticking to her cheek. The office was pitch dark and silent. The fire had died out completely. As Emma's eyes adjusted, she noticed one of the windows had blown open, knocking over a lamp on a nearby table. 

A chill ran down Emma's spine as she realized she was alone in the dark at the witching hour. She strained her ears for any sounds but heard nothing. The empty room seemed menacing now, with shadows flickering at the corners of her vision. Her heart pounding, Emma gathered up her things as quickly as she could, eager to leave this place behind.

She hurried out into the night, the old clock striking a solitary chime as she passed. The streets of the village were deserted. Not even the usual nighttime revelers were about. As Emma walked down the cobblestone road, she glanced over her shoulder at every small noise, half expecting some creature to emerge from the darkness. Her small row house had never seemed so welcoming a sight.

Safely inside with the door bolted, Emma stoked a fire and made herself a cup of chamomile tea. She pulled her worn copy of Magical Creatures of Britain and Ireland from the shelf, intent on reading until dawn. The witching hour had passed and taken its strange magic with it, leaving Emma alone with familiar comforts. She was happy to keep any mysteries the night might hold firmly outside her door.
