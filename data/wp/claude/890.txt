I rubbed my eyes awake as my roommate violently shook me.

"There's no time! We have to go!" she exclaimed, panic in her eyes.

"What? What are you talking about?" I asked, confused. 

"There's no time! I woke up today and time doesn't exist anymore!"

I stared at her, bewildered. "What do you mean time doesn't exist?"

She pointed at the blank clock on my wall. My phone and laptop were also dark. "See? No time."  

I checked my watch, the hands weren't moving. "How is this possible?"

"I don't know but we have to get out of here!" She started packing a bag.

This made no sense but her panic was real. I got up and looked outside, the usual bustle of the city seemed stalled. Birds hung motionless in the air.  

My heart raced. I threw clothes into a bag. If time had truly stopped, who knows what might happen next.  

We ran out of the apartment, the eerie stillness of everything around us sent chills down my spine. I grasped my roommate's arm as we hurried down the stairs, afraid that if we got separated we might become stuck in this eternal emptiness forever.

We spilled out onto the empty streets, not knowing where we were going, just hoping we could outrun the end of time itself.
