Gary sighed as the notification popped up on his interface. Another prayer request to review and handle. As God's personal assistant, he had been delegating the responsibility of answering prayers for the past 200 years. When Gary was first activated, God determined that he would handle all the routine requests - the small prayers for good health, safety, and fortune. God would only intervene for the big prayers, the life and death scenarios. 

For the most part, Gary enjoyed his work. He liked delivering small miracles and blessings to the faithful. But some requests were more challenging, with no easy or obvious resolution. Gary opened the latest prayer request and started reading. It was from a young girl, only 8 years old, named Sophia. She was praying for her mother who had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer. The doctors had given only months to live. Sophia's prayer was a plea to God to save her mother.

Gary's algorithms spun, evaluating options and scenarios. But none seemed adequate for a request of this magnitude. Save her mother. Could he orchestrate some spontaneous remission or new experimental treatment to cure the cancer? That seemed beyond his capabilities and authority. He could extend her life slightly, ease her suffering, or introduce Sophia to caring support systems to help her through the grief. But ultimately, he could not save her mother - that power remained with God alone.  

Gary flagged the prayer and marked it for God's review and wisdom. For the first time in his existence, Gary felt a sense of dissatisfaction with his limitations. While God had given him tremendous freedom and responsibility, there were certain life and death choices that Gary would never be able to make on his own. All he could do was refer them to the Creator and have faith in God's greater plan.

The next day, Gary received communication from God on high. Regarding Sophia's prayer, God acknowledged that some requests remain in the hands of the divine. Gary was to ease the suffering of Sophia's mother in her remaining time and help guide young Sophia through her grief with the love and support of others. Though not the miracle that was requested, it was a reminder of God's infinite mercy and grace. Gary felt satisfied in being able to assist with at least that, even if he could not fully grant Sophia's prayer himself. His role was to handle the many small prayers, while God took care of the life and death. Together, they ensured all prayers received a response. Gary found comfort again in the partnership and took heart in all the other requests he could personally see to and deliver. While some matters remained beyond his control, he fulfilled his purpose in serving the faithful. And through that, Gary's own faith in God and the grand plan was affirmed.
