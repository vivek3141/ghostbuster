The transporter beam faded and I found myself in a stark white room. A voice came over the intercom, "Welcome Agent Drexel. As was explained in your recruitment, you have been selected for an elite black ops division of the CIA focused on correcting historical anomalies through the use of time travel technology."

I nodded, still in shock from the revelation that time travel was not only possible but actively being used to change history.  

The voice continued, "Your first mission is to eliminate John F. Kennedy prior to the unsuccessful attempts of Lee Harvey Oswald. We have determined that Kennedy's leadership led America down the wrong path and caused irreparable damage to the country's political system and global influence."

My heart raced as the implications sunk in. I stammered, "You want me to go back in time and kill President Kennedy?"  

"That is correct. You leave tonight, the timeline will be adjusted so that you are in place in Dallas on November 22, 1963. A rifle will be provided. Complete the mission and return for extraction. Failure is not an option."

I took a deep breath, trying to steady my nerves. I joined the CIA to serve and protect my country, not commit acts of violence against our former leaders. But refusing this mission could put my own life, and possibly others, at risk. I recalled the ominous warning, "Failure is not an option."

Two guards entered the room and escorted me down a long hallway into a large warehouse containing a massive time travel device. My moral crisis would have to wait. The guards handed me a rifle and entered coordinates into the control panel. In a flash of light and confusion of sounds, I found myself on a grassy knoll overlooking Dealey Plaza, waiting for a motorcade that would come into view in just 30 minutes. President Kennedy's fate was now in my hands. My mission had begun.
