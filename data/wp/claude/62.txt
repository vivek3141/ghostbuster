The ancient villa stood atop the hill, overlooking the rolling Tuscan countryside. During the day, Count Balthazar stayed within the thick stone walls of the manor, avoiding the sunlight that would sear his pale skin. 

He stirred as the sun dipped below the horizon, awakening to the night. His senses came alive as he descended the creaking wooden stairs to the kitchen.

"Donatella, what's for dinner tonight?" he called out. His housekeeper and cook, Donatella, had been with his family for generations. She was used to the Count's unusual schedule and needs.

"Buonasera, Count. I have prepared a hearty stew for you, with mushrooms, beans, and potatoes. Made without garlic, of course."

"Grazie, you are too good to me," the Count said, lifting the lid of the stew pot and inhaling the aroma. It smelled delicious, even without garlic. He could never understand why he was so sensitive to that herb, while other vampires were able to consume it. A peculiar weakness he had to live with.

After dinner, the Count went into his study. He sat down at the antique desk and opened a worn leather diary, dipping his quill into ink to record the events of the day—though there was seldom much to report, given how much time he spent indoors. 

As he wrote, he caught a faint whiff of something in the air. Garlic! His pale face blanched even more as he realized Donatella must have used garlic in her own dinner. The odor was emanating from downstairs where she lived. The Count slammed the diary shut and rushed to close the door of the study, locking himself in to avoid the offensive smell.

There was another smell the Count detested—the cloying scent of holy objects. He avoided the village church, as the aroma of incense and sanctified relics made his skin crawl. Religious artifacts held no power over vampires, according to legend, but their smell was very unpleasant to his kind.

And so the Count lived a lonely existence in his isolated villa. He ventured out into the night when the mood struck him, hunting for sustenance to satisfy his immortal thirst, then returning home before dawn to avoid turning into ashes in the sunrise. His human housekeeper kept him nourished in between hunts, as long as she avoided garlic and holy water in his presence.  While not an ideal life, the Count's eternal sentence could have been much less comfortable without Donatella's loyal service and the refuge of his family's ancestral home.
