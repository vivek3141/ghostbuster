My heart skipped a beat as I saw the inky black liquid ooze from the cut on Emma's hand. We had been soulmates for years, blissfully happy and deeply in love. But in that moment, staring at the dark blood staining her pale skin, everything changed. 

Humans are born with milk-white blood, pure and untainted. But with each bad deed or sinful act, our blood grows a deeper shade of crimson. Most people live their whole lives never progressing past a light rose color. Only the truly wicked end up with blood as black as pitch.

When I first met Emma, her blush was the lightest shade of pink, her soul still mostly unmarked by the evils of the world. Her compassion and kindness were two of the many reasons I fell so deeply for her. Over the years together, I had noticed her blush gradually becoming a darker dusty rose, but I assumed it was simply the product of normal human failings and imperfections. I never imagined her blood had become nearly black.

Seeing the truth now, the realization of the darkness that must lurk inside the woman I loved, I stumbled back in horror and confusion. How had I missed this? How could she have hidden such evil from me for so long?

Emma’s eyes flooded with tears as she saw the look on my face. “I’m so sorry,” she whispered. “I never wanted you to find out.”

My mind was reeling. “Why?” I managed to choke out. 

She glanced away, ashamed. “I was afraid I would lose you. I’ve done terrible things, unforgivable things. I thought I could be better, for you. But darkness has lived inside me for as long as I can remember.” Her voice broke. “I don’t expect you to understand. I just want you to know that I love you, with whatever shred of light is left in my soul, I love you.”

I was overwhelmed by emotion. The woman I loved was not who I thought she was. Yet she was still the same woman who had brought me more joy than I could have imagined. The same woman who made me believe that true love and goodness still existed in the world. 

I took her hand in mine, the inky blood staining my own skin. Her blood may run black, but my love for her still ran red. She looked up at me, eyes brimming with hope and uncertainty. 

“We all have darkness within us,” I said gently. “But together, there is light to be found.”
