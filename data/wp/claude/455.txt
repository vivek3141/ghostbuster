The First National Bank of Pine Hills stood regal and imposing, a vestige of an era when banks were built like ancient temples. Jake and his crew had been planning this job for months. The vault was old but nearly impenetrable,  requiring patience and skill to crack. But if they succeeded, the payoff would be huge. 

In the dead of night, Jake and his hacker, Sam, disabled the security system and cameras. His safe cracker, Tim, got to work on the vault as the others kept watch.

"How much longer, Tim?" Jake whispered. Tim didn't look up from the vault as his stethoscope bounced around the dial.

"This one's tricky. Another 15 minutes."

Jake nodded and proceeded upstairs to patrol the lobby. As he peered out the window, a black van came screeching up to the curb. The doors burst open and four armed men in black ski masks stormed the bank entrance. 

"What the...who the hell are these guys?" Jake sputtered. He ducked behind the grand oak teller counter just as the men entered, brandishing AK-47s. 

"Everybody freeze, this is a stickup!" the lead gunman bellowed. "Anybody moves and you're dead!"

Jake's blood turned cold. His crew was trapped in the vault downstairs, unaware of the chaos unfolding above them. He had to keep these attackers from discovering the vault—but how? He was unarmed, outnumbered and outgunned. His heart pounding, he shouted "Don't shoot, I'm coming out!" 

He slowly stood up, hands raised. The gunmen swiveled to face him. 

"Who the hell are you? What are you doing here?" the leader demanded, jabbing his rifle at Jake.

"I—I'm the night guard. I was just making my rounds when I heard a noise. I didn't know it was a robbery!” Jake stammered. He had to convince them quickly before they got curious about the rest of the bank.

The leader strode up to Jake, peering at him through the slits in his ski mask.  “You don't look like any damn security guard I've seen before. What branch you from?"

Jake shrugged, trying to stay casual.  “I'm with Wellsec Security, just started last week.”  

The gunman paused, as if considering whether to believe the story. Jake felt the seconds drag like hours.  He stared at the leader, trying to stare him down despite the situation.

Finally, the leader grunted. "Alright, security man. Open the vault for us and fill up these bags. And no funny business!"

Jake sighed with relief, earning himself a reprieve. "S—sure thing," he stammered. He led two of the gunmen downstairs, frantically trying to figure out how save his crew quietly cracking the  vault.
