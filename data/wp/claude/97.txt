The domed habitat gleamed under the rust-colored sky. After years of training and a grueling 7-month journey, the Mars One colonists had made it. They were pioneers, exploring a new world for humanity.  

Jenna woke for her shift monitoring the life support systems. As she walked through the narrow corridors, she nodded at her fellow colonists. They had become more than friends, they were family now, bound together on this adventure.

While checking the oxygen regulators, Jenna noticed a strange reading and went to investigate. As she entered the supply room, she gasped. Chen, one of the biologists, was slumped on the floor, a pool of blood surrounding his head. She rushed over but it was too late. He was dead.

Panic rose in her chest. They were alone on an alien world with no way home. And now a killer was among them.

The colony went into lockdown. The colonists questioned each other, searching for clues and motives. Chen was liked by all. Who would do this, and why?

After two tense days, a tearful colonist, Nadine, confessed. Chen had rejected her romantic advances in a way she felt was cruel and demeaning. In a fit of rage, she struck him with a wrench. Immediately remorseful, she had hidden the body, unsure of what to do.

They debated Nadine’s fate for hours. No one disputed her guilt, but they couldn’t send her to an execution. Mars didn’t have the death penalty. 

In the end, they decided to keep her imprisoned for the remainder of their lives on Mars. While disappointed in her actions, they forgave her as they were all in this together, still a family. She would do chores and tasks to repay her debt, but she would remain one of Earth’s first children born on another world.

Their dream had suffered a tragedy, but the colony endured. Humans had gained a foothold among the stars. The future was still unwritten.
