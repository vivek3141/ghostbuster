The last person left the graveyard, the caretaker locking the gate behind them. John stood alone at the foot of the fresh grave, the mound of dirt a reminder of the solemn duty just performed.  

He was the only one remaining. The others had paid their respects and offered condolences, but one by one they departed to return to their lives. Yet John remained, unable to peel himself away from the resting place of his dearest friend.

It seemed impossible that just a week ago they were laughing together over beers at their usual spot, making plans for the hiking trip they had taken annually for the past decade. A sudden accident and calamity later, and now John stood with tears in his eyes looking at the wooden cross that simply read “Michael 1970-2020”.

John knelt down and placed a small stone on top of the gravestone, an old habit and sign of respect. His hand lingered on the stone as memories flooded through his mind of all the years of friendship and adventures they had shared.  Although a week had passed, the pain and shock still felt raw. His heart ached with the realization that there would be no more adventures or inside jokes or late night conversations. His best friend, his partner in crime, was gone.  

With a deep sigh, John stood up and knew it was time to leave. The caretaker waited patiently by the gate, avoiding eye contact to give John space for his grieving. John walked slowly out of the graveyard, each step a little more difficult. At the gate, he paused and turned to look one more time at the lonely grave under the large oak tree. “Goodbye old friend,” he whispered. The caretaker squeezed John’s arm reassuringly as he walked through the gate, the final farewell. The graveyard was silent and empty, holding only memories and grief behind its stone walls. John left behind a piece of his heart, buried under the freshly turned earth. Life moved on outside, but for John, the end had already come.
