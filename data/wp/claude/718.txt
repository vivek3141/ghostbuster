The Darkness Within  

I closed my eyes and saw the familiar swirls and patterns dancing in the darkness. Tendrils of light twisting and turning, fading in and out. Always changing yet somehow the same. 

As a child I would stare at the inside of my eyelids, mesmerized by the show. I imagined the lights were fairies or spirits roaming in a mysterious world just beyond my sight. A secret, shadowy realm parallel to our own that I could only glimpse when shutting out the light of day.

Now older, I knew the truth was more mundane. The light show was the random firing of neurons in my retina and visual cortex, a kind of biological noise with no more meaning than static on a television. 

And yet still I wondered. As the lights swirled and glided, morphing from dots to lines to waves, there seemed an ephemeral beauty to it. A ephemeral, fleeting grace that almost felt intentional. I knew scientifically it was meaningless, but deep within the show sparked a sense of meaning or pattern that I couldn't quite grasp. 

Perhaps, I thought, the patterns weren't as random as they seemed. While the lights themselves were chaotic and unguided, as they interacted in my mind didn't they sometimes seem to evoke shapes, forms, and figurations that spoke to something deeper in my psyche? An archetype or primordial symbol left as a watermark by evolution and emerge unbidden. 

As I continued to gaze into the abyss of my inner eyelids, a shape began to emerge. Two circles, then a line between to form a Vesica Piscis, an ancient symbolic shape representing creativity and transcendence. Inside the intersection of the circles appeared a square, a spiral, a complex flower with mandala-like layers of petals. Sacred geometry springing from my neural noise, as though some organizing principle was at work.

Just as I felt I was on the verge of grasping a deep insight, the shapes faded and dissolved back into inchoate swirling lights. The patterns had shifted into new and unrecognizable forms signifying nothing but my own questing mind. 

I opened my eyes, returning again the familiar sights of my room now seeming dull and pale compared to the vision behind my eyelids. An illusion, nothing more than a trick of overactive imagination and pattern seeking brain. And yet I was left with a lingering sense there was meaning to find in the darkness, symbols to be deciphered, insights to be gleaned. A hidden world, perhaps not so mundane after all. My daily life the illusion, and ultimate truth waiting behind my eyelids in the dance of light and shadows.
