I sat in the front row of folding chairs on the football field, the bright sun beating down on the sea of red caps and gowns. My heart was pounding out of my chest. In just a few minutes, I was going to have to give a speech to my entire graduating class, all 500 of us, plus hundreds of parents and teachers.  

Public speaking was my worst nightmare. I'm usually the quiet one, the shy girl who sits in the back of the class and only speaks when called on. But for some reason, our student council president thought it would be a great idea for the valedictorian and the last-ranked student to give speeches at graduation. As the perpetually underachieving student who just barely squeaked by to graduate at the bottom of our class ranking, that meant me.

My mind raced as I thought through what I might say. I didn't want to just mumble a few words of thanks before shuffling off the stage. This was my chance to say what I really thought about my high school experience, warts and all. 

Finally, I heard my name called. On shaky legs I walked up the stairs and crossed the stage, blinking at the harsh spotlights as I arrived at the podium. I took a deep breath and began.

"Most of you probably don't know me very well," I said. "I'm not one for the spotlight. But I have sat in the back of classrooms with all of you for four years, watching and listening, even if no one was watching or listening to me." 

A few knowing chuckles rose from the crowd. I smiled.

"High school isn't easy for everyone. Some of us struggle in ways no one realizes until it's too late. I want anyone out there who feels alone or like they don't matter to know—you do matter. Kindness and compassion are what get us through."

I went on to share a few stories of small kindnesses—a classmate who smiled and said hello in the hall every day, a teacher who encouraged me to find my voice. "Those fleeting moments were what gave me the strength to walk through these doors every morning," I said. 

"As we leave here today, I urge you to create those moments for others. High school is hard enough. A simple smile or hello can mean the world to someone who's struggling. Be the voice for someone who feels voiceless. Lift others up whenever you can."

I raised my voice with conviction for my closing. "We made it, everyone! We survived high school! Now go out there and make the world a little bit kinder. Be a light for others, as others have been a light for us. And know that wherever this life leads you, you will always remain a part of each other's stories. The story of how we made it through."

The applause washed over me as I walked offstage. For once, I felt visible. And I knew that maybe, just maybe, my small voice could make a difference. The story of how we made it through would continue.
