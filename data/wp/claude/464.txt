Captain's Log. Stardate 43765.3 

The S.S. Red Thunder has been drifting in this nebula for 12 days now. The engines are down and we're running out of time. The ion particles in this region have severely drained our power cores and life support is failing on several decks. I have evacuated and sealed off the affected areas, but at this rate we'll be in complete darkness within 72 hours. 

My crew is getting restless. Some are fearful we won't make it out of this expanse. I have tried to boost morale but doubts are seeping in. As captain, I must show resolve and find a solution. But what options remain? We have sent distress signals in all directions. No response. We are alone.

Wait. Sensors have detected a faint power reading 3 AU to starboard. It's small but the signature looks to be a ship! I ordered a course correction to intercept. If we can get within transporter range we may be able board and repair our engines. This could be our only hope. 

We pursued the signal for 6 relentless hours. Several false alarms caused by phantom echoes in the nebula. But finally, sensors resolved an image: it is a small science vessel, adrift and badly damaged. Life signs detected—they have survivors! We pulled alongside and hailed them. A response! Their engines are down too but their transporters still work. I am preparing to beam over with an engineering team. With some miracle, we may just make it out of this alive.

The red swirls of the nebula are a constant reminder of the razor's edge between life and the void. But today, they shine a little brighter. Our brother and sister explorers have given us a chance to live on—and return home. The galaxy is vast, but we are never alone. My crew's hope is restored. The captain's log continues. Our mission endures.
