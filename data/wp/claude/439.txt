The diner was empty at this early hour, just the way I liked it. I settled into my usual booth by the window, nodding at the waitress who wordlessly poured my coffee. 

As I scanned the menu, weighing the merits of pancakes versus an omelette, a young woman slid into the seat across from me. I looked up, startled. I was used to eating alone.

"Don't be alarmed," she said soothingly. "I just wanted to join you for breakfast." She smiled, her eyes glinting in the morning sunlight filtering through the window. 

There was something strange yet familiar about her. "Do I know you?" I asked. 

She laughed, a sound like delicate wind chimes. "Not exactly. But I know you."

The waitress appeared again and the woman ordered orange juice and toast. I put in my request for pancakes.

"So what brings you here to join me today?" I asked. I felt I should be unsettled by this strange woman's presence but instead I felt a sense of peace emanating from her.

"I wanted to see how you were doing. I've been keeping an eye on you lately."

Her words should have alarmed me but her tone was so benign and caring. "Keeping an eye on me? Why?"

She smiled again. "Because your struggles haven't gone unnoticed. I've seen you go through some difficulties lately and I want you to know things will improve. There are bright days ahead."

Her words filled me with warmth, and I could feel tears of gratitude pricking at my eyes. "Thank you. I needed to hear that." I paused, realizing I didn't even know this woman.  "I'm sorry but who are you?"

"You can call me a friend. Or think of me as your guardian of sorts." 

A tingle traveled down my spine. "Are you saying you're some kind of...angel?"

She laughed again. "Not exactly. I'm not celestial. I'm more...divine. A goddess, if you will." 

My jaw dropped. I was having breakfast with a goddess? Impossible and yet, I couldn't help but believe her. There was no other explanation for the sense of comfort and love I felt in her presence. 

She reached across the table and squeezed my hand. "Things will get better. Just remember, I'm always here." She let go, leaving a warmth in my fingers. 

In that instant, I blinked, and she was gone. Had I imagined the whole thing? No -- there was a glowing peace inside me and the unmistakable imprint of love in my hand. I had been given a gift from the divine over breakfast.
