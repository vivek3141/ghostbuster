Jenny woke up late for work, again. Her alarm didn't go off and her boss had warned her about being tardy one more time. She rushed to get ready and skipped breakfast, but hit traffic on the way to the office. By the time she made it in, she was over an hour late. Her boss was furious and threatened to fire her if she couldn't fix her "lateness problem."  

Feeling dejected, Jenny headed out for a coffee during her break. In her haste and distraction, she bumped into a stranger, spilling coffee all down the front of his expensive-looking suit. “I’m so sorry!” she exclaimed. The man waved off her apology with a smile. She offered to pay for dry cleaning but he told her not to worry. His kindness lifted her spirits for a moment.

Back at her desk, Jenny's computer crashed, losing hours of work. Nearly in tears, she wondered how this day could get any worse. At lunch, she opened her meal to find the order was completely wrong. The waiter apologized and offered her a free meal, but she had lost her appetite.

As Jenny left work, the sky opened up and rain came pouring down. Her misery was complete. She sat in her car, overcome with self-pity, and had a good cry. 

A tap at the window startled her. It was the stranger from the coffee shop, holding an umbrella. “Looks like you're having a rough day,” he said. She laughed in spite of herself. “The worst.”  He smiled kindly. “Come on, let me buy you a drink. The day's almost over and tomorrow will be better.”  

Jenny took a breath and let it out slowly. She turned the key in the ignition. “Why not?” she said, managing a small smile. 

She allowed herself to be led into a warm, dry bar.  Her day from hell faded into memory as good company and conversation reminded her that small acts of kindness can make even the worst days bearable. And that sometimes, on those days when absolutely nothing seems to go right, a friendly face can turn it all around and point you toward a happy ending.
