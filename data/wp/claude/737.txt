The gnarled branches of the ancient oaks twisted up into the night sky, blocking out the moon and stars. The forest was dark, so dark that Eliza could barely see the path in front of her as she slowly made her way through the woods. 

Her lantern only provided a dim glow, just enough light to see a few feet around her at a time. The shadows seemed to creep and crawl, taking on strange shapes. Every snap of a branch or rustle in the underbrush sent her heart racing. Her knuckles turned white as she gripped the handle of the lantern tight.

Eliza knew these woods well, having walked through them countless times to visit her dear friend Abigail who lived in a small cottage on the other side of the forest. But tonight felt different. There were noises she didn't recognize, and movements in the corner of her eye that vanished when she turned her head. 

As she walked, an uneasy feeling built in the pit of her stomach. Her mother's warning echoed in her mind: "There's all kinds of dark things in these woods, Eliza. You best be home before nightfall." She shuddered as an owl hooted in the distance, its eerie call breaking the silence. 

Pressing onward down the winding path, she thought of Abigail waiting for her, a warm fire and tea to chase away the chill. But with each step the forest seemed to close in around her, the trees towering overhead and grasping at her with gnarled branches like bony fingers.

When an unearthly howl rang out in the darkness, Eliza's nerve finally broke. She gathered up her skirts and ran as fast as her feet could carry her down the path, lantern light bobbing madly around her. The journey back seemed far longer in the dark, but at last she emerged from the tree line and saw her cottage, warm candlelight glowing in the windows. 

Eliza burst through the door and sank into her mother's arms, sobbing with relief. "Hush now, dear one, you're safe," her mother soothed. As Eliza caught her breath, she described the strange sounds and sinister feelings that had overwhelmed her in the woods.

Her mother sighed knowingly. "Aye, there are dark things that dwell deep in the forest. But you need not fear them, not when you have the light to guide your way. The darkness hides what the light reveals." 

Eliza gazed out the window at the inky black woods in the distance, but now from the safety of her home full of warmth and light. Her mother was rightâ€”she had made it through the darkness and back again. The light had shown her the way.
