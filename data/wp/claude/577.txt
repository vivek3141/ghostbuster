I woke with a start, my heart pounding. Something felt off. The light streaming through my curtains seemed different.

I looked around my room, shaking off the last remnants of sleep, and suddenly realized why I felt so disoriented. This was my old bedroom, in the apartment I had lived in three years ago. 

But how was that possible? I had moved across town two years ago into a new place with Amy, my girlfriend. At least, Amy was my girlfriend until we had broken up last year. 

None of that had happened, apparently. It was three years in the past, and somehow I was the only one aware of it.

Panicked thoughts raced through my mind as I tried to make sense of this impossible situation. Did I have some kind of psychotic break? Was I trapped in a vivid dream? Everything felt completely real.

I needed to find out if this strangeness extended beyond me. I called Amy, my fingers trembling as I dialed her familiar old number. 

She answered, her voice bringing back a rush of memories. “Hey you! I was just going to call you. Are we still on for brunch?” 

We had a standing Sunday brunch date three years ago. My throat tightened. “Amy, this is going to sound crazy, but what's today's date?”

“It's May 12, 2016. Why do you ask?” she replied, confused. I heard her clock chime in the background, confirming the date.

2016. It was real. The last three years of my life had vanished as if they never happened. But how was that possible?

“I just had the strangest feeling of déjà vu,” I stammered. I couldn't begin to explain the truth to her. She would think I had lost my mind. 

“Are you okay?” Amy asked. I imagined her frowning with worry on the other end of the line, and felt a surge of affection for this past version of her I had lost long ago.

“I'm fine,” I said. “Still on for brunch. See you soon.”

I hung up, shaken by the implications. The world had reset to three years past, but I somehow remembered everything that had happened since. I alone carried the memories of events that had now never transpired. 

It struck me that I had been given an extraordinary gift: the chance to relive the last three years, to remedy past mistakes and regrets, to make different choices. My life could veer off in an entirely new direction from this point forward. 

The possibilities swam before me, overwhelming and exhilarating. I leapt out of bed, remembering I had a date with Amy to get to, and feeling happier than I had in a long, long time. The future was unwritten, and now the present had returned to me when I thought it was lost forever.
