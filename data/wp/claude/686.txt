I have always had an exceptional memory. Total recall, some might say. I can remember details from when I was a toddler, my first days of preschool, specific conversations from years past. My memory is a gift and a curse.

Lately though, the memories have been getting stranger. Flashes of places I've never been, snippets of conversations between unfamiliar voices. At first, I dismissed them as odd dreams or a trick of the mind. But they felt so real. And they kept coming, these fragments of a life I never lived. 

Yesterday, I had the most vivid memory yet. I was in a laboratory, peering through a microscope at a petri dish. Only it wasn't me. The hands adjusting the lenses were wrinkled with age, the voice discussing results with a colleague was not my own. But I could feel everything - the ache in the man's lower back, the excitement at what he was observing. 

I don't know whose life I'm tapping into, or how. I only know that my perfect memory now stretches back generations, perhaps centuries. I can access knowledge and experiences that should be impossible for me to have.

My gift has become both wonder and burden. Do I now live only to serve as a vessel for the memories of others? Or is there some deeper meaning and purpose to these visions from beyond my own existence? I alone harbor the lives of the dead. The past and present collide in my mind - a perfect, eternal memory. But whose memory do I now hold? I fear the answer and long to discover the truth. My memory holds wonders and terrors, and I no longer know where I end and it begins.
