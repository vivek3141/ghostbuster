The Detonator 

Jenny was riding the subway home from work, squeezing into a packed train car. As the doors closed and the train lurched into the tunnel, a figure caught her eye.

A man was standing perfectly still, clutching a battered briefcase. His eyes were closed and he was muttering under his breath. But what alarmed Jenny was the wiring protruding from the briefcase, connected to a device with a countdown timer.

3:47...3:46...3:45...

Her heart seized with terror. A bomb. This man was carrying a bomb.

Jenny started panicking, looking around wildly. But everyone else was absorbed in their phones or books, oblivious. She opened her mouth to scream—but then hesitated. What if she was wrong? What if it was a misunderstanding and she caused mass hysteria over nothing?

3:30...3:29...3:28...

The timer was ticking down quickly. Jenny knew she had to do something before it was too late.

She cautiously made her way over to the man with the briefcase, her legs shaking. Up close, he looked utterly normal—just a tired commuter like anyone else. But Jenny knew better. 

“Excuse me,” she said, her voice trembling. “What’s in the case? And why is it counting down?”

The man’s eyes snapped open. For a moment, his expression was wild and sinister. But then he smiled politely.

“Oh, don’t worry, miss. This is just a prototype for my engineering class. The countdown timer and wiring aren’t connected to any actual explosive device. My apologies for alarming you.” His voice was smooth and reassuring. 

Jenny wavered, wanting to believe him. But her gut told her not to trust this man. She steeled herself and said loudly, “I don't believe you. Everyone, we have to get out of here! This man has a bomb!”

Panic erupted in the train car as people screamed and scrambled over each other to escape. The man with the briefcase protested his innocence, claiming it was all a misunderstanding, even as he was jostled and tossed aside in the pandemonium.

When the train pulled into the next station, the police were waiting. They grabbed the man, wrestled the briefcase away from him—and found that it contained only wires, clocks, and batteries. No actual explosive material.

Jenny’s warning had been for nothing. She had caused chaos and disruption based only on her own paranoia and prejudice. She realized with dawning horror that the real terror she had feared was within herself. The Detonator that she truly needed to defuse was her own panic and intolerance—before they could do damage again.
