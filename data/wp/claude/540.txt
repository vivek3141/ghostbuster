The lonely road stretched endlessly into the night. I had been driving for hours already, the yellow lines blurring into a hypnotic flow under the glare of my headlights. Every now and then, a hitchhiker would emerge from the darkness, arm raised, silently pleading for a ride. But I never stopped. Something felt off about them, a strange familiarity I couldn't place.

After the third hitchhiker in what seemed like 15 minutes, an unsettling feeling crept into my mind. Their overalls, their scruffy beards, their old rucksacks—it was all oddly familiar. Too familiar. But it wasn't possible, I shook my head. I must be getting drowsy and imagining things in the dark. 

To shake off the uneasy feeling, I turned on the radio. Loud rock music filled the car, helping to keep me awake as I drove on. 

And then there he was again, the hitchhiker with the green cap and denim jacket. His thumb was still stuck out, like he had been walking the whole time I had passed him. I blinked in disbelief and accelerated the car. This was impossible. I had left him behind miles ago.

Panic started to rise in my chest as I began to understand. They were the same hitchhikers, over and over, caught in some bizarre trick of time and space. No matter how fast or how far I drove, I couldn't escape them. They were doomed to walk this lonely road forever, endlessly hoping for escape. 

A scream caught in my throat as I swerved violently around the next hitchhiker—the woman in the flower dress, who I had passed when the night was still young. My heart pounding, I slammed down the pedal as hard as I could. The speedometer climbed higher and higher as I raced down that road into the darkness, driven by the terrible realization that there might be no escape from that place after all. The hitchhikers were always going to be there, stuck in an endless loop, and I had become trapped right along with them.
