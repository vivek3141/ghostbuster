The dusty road to Sacramento had nearly been the death of me. My wagon wheel hit a rut and snapped, sending me tumbling into the path of an oncoming stagecoach. Just as the horses were upon me, I felt a rush of air and found myself on the side of the road, my heart pounding. 

An angelic figure stood before me, glowing with a golden light. "You must be more careful, Jonathan," she said in a voice that rang like a heavenly choir. I was stunned into silence by her beauty. She gazed at me with eyes deeper than the deepest ocean.

After she vanished, I couldn't get her out of my mind. I had always scoffed at the notion of angels, yet now I knew the truth. And this angel had saved my life. She had called me by name - she knew me! I became obsessed with seeing her again.

The next week, I ventured out to the dodgiest saloon in town, knowing full well the dangers. Sure enough, a brawl erupted and a mean drunkard knocked me in the head with a bottle. As I faded into darkness, my angel appeared before me. "Jonathan, this must stop," she insisted. But I could only stare at her in wonder.

I knew then I would never stop courting danger if it meant I could gaze upon her beauty again and again. My guardian angel, who knew my name, had captured my heart. Mortal women paled in comparison. I would tempt death gladly if it brought me another moment in her presence. My own salvation was nothing compared to her love, for she was my heaven on this earth.
