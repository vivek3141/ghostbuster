The old forest path was dark as I made my way home late that night. My flashlight barely cut through the dense trees that lined the path. As I walked, I thought I saw something strange in the distance. I blinked and shook my head, sure it was just my tired eyes playing tricks on me.  

A few more steps and I saw it again. A distortion, a warped spot in the air that didn't seem right. I stopped in my tracks. It was if I was seeing double, like a glitch in reality.

I rubbed my eyes but it was still there. A strange pulsating, shimmering spot floating in mid-air. As I peered closer, for a second the glitch seemed to clear and I could see through to the other side. But what I saw didn't make sense. It was daylight on the other side and the trees were different. I blinked and it went back to the shimmering glitch.

My heart raced. What was this? Some strange illusion, a trick of dark woods? I reached out slowly with my flashlight, casting its beam on the glitch. But the light seemed to bend and warp as it hit the spot, dispersing in strange directions.

I knew I couldn't leave this unexplored. I steeled my nerves and walked slowly forward. The glitch began to take up my entire field of view until I was surrounded by its pulsing, distorted reality.

Then, suddenly, I emerged on the other side. But it was daylight. The trees were different species and the path was wider and more worn. In the distance I could see a house that looked like mine but wasn't.

Realization hit me like a bolt of lightning. I had walked through some kind of tear in the fabric of reality. A wormhole or portal to another place, another time. 

My mind raced at the implications. If I could pass through, who else could? What should I do now? Try to find my way back to the glitch and return home? 

Just then I heard a noise on the path and saw a figure approaching in the distance. My heart leapt to my throat. I hid behind a large tree, peeking out to get a better look, hoping it wasn't anything dangerous.

As the figure got closer, I almost gasped in shock. It was a woman walking a dog. But not just any woman. It was me, or another version of me, whistling as she walked down the forest path on a sunny afternoon.

I watched, stunned, as she passed right by my hiding spot without noticing my presence. I peered around the tree to look at her walking away down the path. She was me but somehow not me. In that strange glitch in reality, I had gained a glimpse into another world, a parallel dimension, and seen the shadow of my other self walking in the sun. I turned back to find the glitch, my heart pounding, hoping to pass back through and return to the safety of my own familiar world, with this bizarre secret tucked firmly under my hat.
