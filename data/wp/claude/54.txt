The Note 

Jake stared at the scribbled note in his hands, reading the two short sentences over and over.

This will not be easy. Do not fail.

His heart raced as he contemplated what he was about to do. Was he really willing to go through with this? Once the wheels were in motion, there would be no stopping it. 

But he had come this far, and his life insurance policy was all set. His family would be taken care of. With a deep breath, Jake steadied his shaking hands and dialed the number.

“I have a job for you,” he said, launching into the details. The voice on the other end listened silently. They did not ask any questions. They did not need to—their reputation spoke for itself. The less information exchanged, the better.

“It will be done,” the voice finally responded. The call ended with a click.

Jake’s heart pounded as he realized there was no turning back now. The hit man was notorious for always completing his tasks. Always. 

The next week, Jake went about his normal routine, all while wondering if today would be the day. The waiting and anticipation were wearing him down, fraying his nerves. A few times, he thought he was being followed and watched, but then the strange car or person would vanish. His mind was playing tricks on him.

Ten days after the call, Jake was in his garage fixing a leaky pipe when his senses suddenly prickled. This time, it was not his imagination—he could feel another presence. He spun around just as a gloved hand clamped over his mouth and his world went black.

Jake awoke to darkness. His arms and legs were bound tightly to a chair. This was it—the end he had orchestrated himself. His mind flashed to his two young children who would soon be orphans. A wave of regret and angst washed over him.

A dim light clicked on. The hit man stood there, his cold eyes peering out from behind a black mask. In his hand was a gleaming knife. And in that moment, Jake knew it would not be easy or painless. It was to be brutal, as a lesson to others.

“Please, just make it quick,” Jake stammered.

The hit man shook his head. “The note said this would not be easy. Your instructions will be followed.” 

A sob caught in Jake's throat as the hit man slowly approached, twirling the knife, savoring the moment like a predator toying with its prey. Jake closed his eyes, 
holding onto his last thoughts of his children as the first cut sliced into his flesh.

His own words echoed in his mind. This will not be easy. If only he had known how true that would be.
