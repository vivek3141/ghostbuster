The darkness enveloped me as I inched forward through the dense forest. I knew this was a bad idea, going for a hike so late in the day, but my adventurous spirit got the better of me. 

As night fell, I lost my sense of direction. The trails disappeared into the blackness and an eerie silence filled the air. My heart started pounding as panic set in. I was lost.

Using my phone's flashlight, I tried to find a trail, any clue to point me toward civilization. But the dim light only illuminated a few feet in front of me. I didn't know which way to turn.

In the distance, I heard the crack of a branch. Then another snap, and the rustling of leaves. Something was moving in the darkness, circling me. My mind raced with the possibilities of what predator stalked me, hungry for its next meal.

A pair of eyes reflected in the light, glowing orange and menacing. I froze in terror as a roar echoed through the forest, shaking me to my core. This was a catastrophic mistake. I was in the territory of a mountain lion on the hunt.

Adrenaline surged as the lion padded closer, its eyes never leaving me. I clenched my fists, ready to fight for my life if attacked. After a few agonizing minutes of its prowling, the lion suddenly turned and ran off into the night, as if called away. 

I didn't wait to see if it might return. My hike in the woods ended as I sprinted as fast as I could to the trailhead, scratched, bleeding, terrified - but alive. I swore I would never hike alone in the dark again. My thrill-seeking days were over.
