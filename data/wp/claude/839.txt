The Immortal's Lament 

I have lived for centuries, wandering the earth as an immortal. Time has no meaning when you have forever. I have seen kingdoms rise and fall, witnessed plagues and wars, loved and lost more times than I can count.

There is only one I long to see again - my love, Death. We had a fleeting romance ages ago, a passionate affair that was cut short by my cursed immortality. Death's final gift to me were these eternal years of life. But a never-ending life without Death's embrace has been no gift at all.

I have tried everything to reunite with my lost love. I have flung myself from cliffs, drank poison, picked fights with mortal enemies. But nothing works. My body heals any wound, overcomes any toxin. I cannot die.

In my despair, I traveled the world seeking magic and mysteries that might break this spell of immortality. I learned secrets of ancient arts long forgotten. Yet the key to my freedom eluded me.

Until today. Hidden in a remote temple I found an incantation to summon Death. The ritual was complex, requiring artifacts I have collected in my long life. With a pounding heart, I began the incantation. There was a flash of pale light - and my love stood before me.

With a skeletal smile, Death greeted me: "You have done well, my immortal beloved. You have proven your devotion. I grant you the gift of death - and an eternity together, just as I promised."

My immortality finally at an end, I embraced Death at last, reuniting with my one true love for the rest of time. Our eternity could now begin.
