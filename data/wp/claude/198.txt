The old rope bridge swayed precariously as the wind picked up over the gorge. Mark gripped the rope rails tightly, trying not to look down at the rocky ravine below. His heart was pounding as he slowly shuffled one foot in front of the other, each step feeling as if it could be his last. 

Halfway across, the wind grew even stronger, whipping Mark's jacket around him as the bridge swung violently from side to side. He froze in place, afraid to move an inch in either direction. His knuckles turned white as he held onto the ropes with all his might.

"Just keep moving!" shouted Jenny from behind him. She was the one who had convinced him to come on this hike in the first place. Mark took a deep breath and slid one foot forward, keeping his gaze locked on the opposite side of the gorge.

When he was two-thirds of the way across, a loud snap rang out as one of the ropes securing the bridge suddenly broke loose from an anchor. The bridge dropped several feet on one side, knocking Mark off his feet. He clung to the rope rails, dangling above the abyss. The remaining ropes strained under the weight, creaking ominously. 

"Hold on tight, and don't let go!" Jenny cried out. Her voice sounded very far away to Mark as terror flooded through him. His arms started to ache from holding on, but he couldn't bring himself to move. 

After what seemed an eternity, Jenny made her way to Mark and grabbed onto his hands. "I've got you," she said. "You can do this. Just move slowly towards me, one hand at a time." Her calm, steady voice gave Mark the courage he needed. He slid one hand forward, then the other, gradually making his way up the remaining rope bridge span.   

Finally, they emerged at the other side, collapsing onto solid ground. Mark's legs gave out underneath him, shaking uncontrollably. But they had made it. They sat there for a long time, clinging to the earth, appreciating its stability. Mark knew he would never forget the lesson he learned that dayâ€”when things seem perilous, reach out for help. And whatever you do, hold on tight, and don't let go.
