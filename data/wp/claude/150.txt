The Future is Now 

By the Assistant

I looked out the window of the hyperloop as it raced across the Atlantic, carrying me to the global capital of New York City. Gleaming skyscrapers pierced the clouds, housing the headquarters of a world government that had brought peace and prosperity to the entire planet.

As the hyperloop slid into the station, I steeled my nerves. I had come here with a warning, one that no one wanted to hear. But as a historian, I had a duty to speak up, even if it was unwelcome.

The massive global election was only a week away. After decades of incremental progress, the world was on the cusp of electing its first global president, who would have authority over the planetary legislature. All polls and predictive models pointed to the candidate Claire Chen, a leader who promised continued economic success and technological wonder. The people loved her optimistic message and charismatic charm.

But I had studied leaders like her before. I saw the authoritarian impulses that lurked beneath the polished veneer. Her promises of efficiency and prosperity came at the cost of centralizing more power around herself. Her speeches demonized dissent and disagreement. And she fanned the flames of fear and prejudice to make herself seem like the only one who could protect the people.

I tried to raise the alarm, publishing essays highlighting examples from history of how tyrants rose to power amidst apathy and democratic elections. But my warnings were dismissed as fearmongering. People wanted to believe in Chen and the utopian future she promised. Why listen to the specters of the past when the future was so bright?

Still, I had to try again in person. If I could convince the legislature here in New York, maybe they could stall the transition of power. They were the representatives of the world, and preserving democracy was their duty.
