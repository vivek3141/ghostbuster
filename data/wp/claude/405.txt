The Merfolk Marketing Challenge 

Vera flipped her shimmering turquoise tail in frustration, splashing the other merfolk gathered in the underwater cave. “It’s not fair,” she complained. “Humans seem fascinated with made-up creatures like zombies, vampires and werewolves. But we real merfolk get no attention or adoration.”

“We need better public relations,” suggested a merman with a crimson tail. “We need to revamp our image, make ourselves more alluring and mysterious to humans.” The others nodded in agreement.

“But how?” Vera asked. “We can’t exactly walk on land or set up social media profiles. And the few times humans have spotted us, they just scream in terror or try to catch us for display in some aquarium.”  

An older mermaid with long flowing white hair and a tail of sea green floated forward. “I have an idea,” she said. “For centuries, we have shunned humans and avoided their ships and dwellings. We have allowed ourselves to fade into myth and legend. But to become enticing, we must do the opposite. We must make selective contact, teasing humans with fleeting glimpses of our world. We must use our magic to leave clues and messages that spark their imagination and make them yearn for more.”   

Vera and the others considered this. "You mean instead of hiding, we court their interest? Seduce them with mystery and intrigue?" asked Vera. The old mermaid smiled, showing a flash of pearly fangs.  

And so the campaign began. On moonlit nights, the merfolk would surface just enough to allow their luminous eyes and scales to be spotted in the waves by passing ships. They started leaving little clues on beaches— intricately crafted shells, pebbles etched with sea symbols, drops of pearls and patches of shimmering algae. Humans discovered messages in bottles that hinted at a secret underwater world and boasted of its wonders.    

The merfolk also enlisted the help of sea creatures. Dolphins would gently prod at boats and delight in humans' delighted squeals, then dive down as if summoned back to their underwater kingdom. Whales sang haunting songs under the midnight sea, keeping fishermen and sailors awake with dreams of mythical creatures.  

Soon, news of the strange happenings spread. Humans whispered of mysteries in the deep, and merfolk sightings became hotly discussed and speculated upon. Some wondered if an advanced sea-dwelling race was reaching out to make contact. Others believed it was spirits or supernatural beings.  

As curiosity mounted into obsession, the merfolk decided it was time for the next phase. They began allowing themselves to be briefly spotted underwater—a flash of a tail here, a glimpse of fins there—always keeping their kingdom veiled and beckoning explorers to discover more.  

By the time films, books and television shows started featuring handsome mermen and alluring mermaids, the merfolk had achieved their goal. They had made themselves enticing, irresistible and coveted. Vera smiled, pleased with how well their marketing campaign had worked. The humans would never get enough of the merfolk’s mystery and magic. And that, she thought with a flick of her glimmering tail, was exactly as it should be.
