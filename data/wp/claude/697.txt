Tom sighed as he looked at the latest exam results posted outside Professor Hawking's office. 32 out of 100. Another failing grade. At this rate, he was going to flunk out of the physics program. His dreams of becoming a scientist were slipping away. 

He dragged himself to the lab to start his final project, building a device to demonstrate the principle of light speed invariance. As he began tinkering with the apparatus, connecting light sensors and timers and a laser, his mind wandered to fantasies of proving his theory of faster-than-light travel.  

What if he adjusted the laser to a higher frequency? It was a crazy idea, but at this point he had nothing to lose. He made the modifications and activated the laser. The readings on his light sensors went off the charts. He blinked in shock. The laser pulse appeared to be moving faster than light speed.

Heart pounding, he ran the experiment again. Same results. He couldn't believe it. He had made an accidental discovery that violated everything modern physics stood for.

Tom burst into Professor Hawking's office, nearly shouting with excitement as he explained his findings. The professor listened with a bemused smile, his wrinkled hands folded on the desk. 

"Impossible," Professor Hawking said. "You must have made a mistake in your calculations or experimental setup. Nothing can travel faster than light."

Tom insisted the professor come see for himself. With a sigh, the professor followed him to the lab. Tom showed him the results with pride and excitement.

Professor Hawking examined the apparatus, eyebrows furrowing. He ran the experiment again himself. And again. Finally, he straightened up.

"There seems to be an anomaly here I can't explain immediately. But Tom, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. The odds of you singlehandedly overturning our understanding of physics are infinitesimally small. I'm afraid I can't accept your results as valid unless and until they are confirmed through rigorous testing and independent verification by other scientists."

Tom's heart sank. He had hoped for praise, a pat on the back, encouragement. Not outright rejection and disbelief. His accidental discovery was going nowhere. 

Dejected, Tom plodded back to his dorm room. He was going to fail the physics program after a finding that should earn him a Nobel Prize. 

Irony was a cruel mistress. Yet in that moment Tom realized the truth in Hawking's words. Real science was not about luck or chance discovery. It was perseverance, rigor, methodical work. His shortcuts and fantastical thinking had led him astray. 
 
There were no shortcuts to changing the world or becoming a scientist. Only hard work, discipline, and dedication. Tom made a decision. He was going to start over. Do things right. Apply himself fully with diligence and rigor. And maybe, just maybe, he would have another chance to prove the impossible after all. But next time, he would be ready.
