General Bolden made his way to the antechamber, as he had done twice before. He recalled with amusement how Presidents Bush and Obama simply laughed at him before carrying on with the briefing, just as his predecessors recalled tales of 'The Revelation' dating all the way back to the Johnson administration.  

It began as a dare, something two drunken scientists made in a Houston bar back in the days of the Mercury program. If either of them made it to the office of the Administrator, they would assemble some official-looking presentation and bring it in for the President's in-brief. Something in private, very secret, plenty of pomp and circumstance for what would really just be an icebreaker at the beginning of a long and boring meeting.

The first to ascend to the Administrator's role was Dr. Bob Porter, one of the conspirators. True to his word, within a month of taking office he requested a private meeting with President Johnson to discuss a matter of "utmost secrecy."

With a straight face, Porter laid out the faux revelations. Alien contact, hidden for decades but now declassified for the President's eyes only. Cryptic messages from beings far more advanced, warning of future calamities. Visions of a looming catastrophe that only covert preparations could address.  

Johnson's eyes grew wider until Porter could no longer contain his laugh. The President erupted in a fury, then grudgingly praised Porter for his bold trick and asked him to carry on the tradition to spook future world leaders.  

Every Administrator since had prepared their successor to continue 'The Revelation.' Some crafted elaborate displays, feigning that the hoax was passed between Administrations to maintain its plausibility. Others merely delivered it deadpan without pretense.  

General Bolden was unsure how President Harris would receive it. As a veteran of the space program herself, she might see the humor. Or she might feel affronted at what could be seen as disrespect for the office. He took a breath and entered the antechamber, ready to find out if 'The Revelation' would live on for another round. His aide followed, struggling to keep a straight face, the "classified documents" clutched in his hands.
