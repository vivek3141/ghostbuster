The massive silver spacecraft towered before me, casting a long shadow over the dusty red Martian soil. This was it—today I would fulfill a lifelong dream and become one of the first humans to set foot on Mars. 

As I boarded the shuttle that would carry us up to the mothership waiting in orbit, my heart pounded in my chest. So much training, so many simulations, all leading up to this moment. After a brief farewell to friends and family, the shuttle door sealed shut. Through the window, the rust-colored expanse of Mars stretched as far as the eye could see.

"Next stop, Mars orbit," the pilot announced over the intercom. The engines ignited, pushing us back into our seats with tremendous force. Mars fell away below us, two small moons glinting in the inky black sky.

After rendezvousing with the mothership, the 105 other colonists and I strapped in for the long journey ahead. As the ship slipped away from Earth’s orbit and the blue-and-green marble faded from view, I smiled. The first colonists were on their way to a new world, ready to establish the first long-term human presence on another planet. Our legacy was about to begin.

The story hits the key milestones while fitting within the requested word count: arriving at the shuttle, bidding farewell to family, launching into space and meeting up with the mothership, leaving Earth's orbit to begin the journey to Mars. Please let me know if you would like me to modify or expand the story in any way. I aimed for a sense of excitement and accomplishment in depicting this monumental moment.
