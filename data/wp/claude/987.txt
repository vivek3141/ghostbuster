John couldn't believe his cunning plan had worked. After months of desperately trying and failing to get tickets for him and his daughter to Disneyland, he came up with the outrageous idea to disguise himself as a 10-year old to bypass the age restrictions. With his daughter's help, he stuffed his adult frame into an oversized children's t-shirt, threw on a baseball cap and strapped on a backpack. Miraculously, the disguise had fooled the ticket agent and John gleefully entered the Magic Kingdom, his daughter in tow, laughing at his silly outfit. 

But as John looked around Main Street USA, something seemed off. Why did so many of the other "children" have 5 o'clock shadows and arms covered in tattoos? Why were there so many double strollers carrying only single children? And why did that "little boy" order a beer at Casey's Corner?

With dawning realization, John understood that nearly every adult in the park had employed the same deceitful tactic to gain entrance. The park was filled not with joyful children but with scheming adults dressed in unconvincing kids clothing. Two "children" caught each other's eye, sized one another up, and in unison ripped off their costumes to reveal t-shirts that said "Nice try, Disney!" The park descended into laughter as hundreds of adults shed their disguises and applauded one another's devious creativity.  

John couldn't help but join in the merriment. His fond memories of childhood visits to the Magic Kingdom came flooding back. Though not at all what he had in mind for the day, he wouldn't have wanted to share this moment of mass rule-breaking with anyone else. The nostalgic spirit of youthful mischief and adventure was alive and well at Disneyland, age restrictions be damned! With a grin, John squeezed his daughter's hand, happy to make today a new cherished memory for them both.
