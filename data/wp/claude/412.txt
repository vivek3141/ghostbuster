The old abandoned farmhouse stood atop the hill, silhouetted against the orange and pink hues of the setting sun. Jenny slowly made her way up the creaky porch steps, the musty smell of damp wood filling her nostrils. 

As she entered through the front door, a cloud of dust erupted with her every step, swirling around in the last golden rays of light streaming through the dirt-caked windows. The house felt heavy with memories as Jenny explored each room.  

In the kitchen, she ran her fingers over the rough wooden countertops, imagining the meals that had been prepared here. Her mouth began to water, thinking she could almost taste the sweet tang of homemade apple pie.

She wandered into the living room, threading her way around moth-eaten furniture and debris littering the floor. Picking up a framed photo, she wiped away layers of grime and soot to reveal a smiling family posing in front of the house. Squinting in the fading light, she could just make out the figures of two young children chasing each other into the barn, their laughter echoing in her mind.

As darkness descended, shadows began to close in around her. An owl hooted in the distance, sending a chill down her spine. Her heart pounding, she stumbled up the creaking stairs to find the children's bedroom. Sitting on one of the tiny beds, she ran her hands over the soft quilt, threadbare but still colorful. Closing her eyes, in that moment she could imagine being comforted here as a child, secure in the warmth of the quilts, listening to the whispered bedtime stories of her parents in the flickering candlelight.

Jenny smiled into the darkness, breathing in the scent of faded lavender as she drifted off to sleep surrounded by the echoes of the past. She dreamed of summer days filled with joy and laughter, of the love within these walls that still lingered, clinging as dust motes in the moonlight.
