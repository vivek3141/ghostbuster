The Consultant

Martin adjusted his tie in the mirror and took a deep breath. It was just another case study, he told himself. But this time it involved a wedding. 

His client, a wealthy businessman, had hired him to impersonate his daughter’s fiancé and go through with the wedding. The real fiancé had fled the country after embezzling funds from the family company. His client wanted to avoid embarrassment and have the lavish wedding proceed as planned.

As Martin walked down the aisle, he tried to push aside his doubts. He smiled at the radiant bride and repeated the words, "I do." The ceremony was a success. His work was done. After a quick change out of the tuxedo, Martin slipped away unnoticed, another acting role completed. He told himself he wouldn't think of the heartbroken woman he left behind. It was just a job.

The Prisoner  

Jake fidgeted with the handcuffs around his wrists, the metal digging into his skin. His orange prison jumpsuit was a grim reminder of how much his life had derailed. Yet today he was getting married. 

When he saw Mary walking down the aisle in a simple white dress, her eyes rimmed in red from crying, his breath caught in his throat. She was as beautiful as the day he met her. He didn't deserve her.

Mary held his hands through the bars of the visiting room as they exchanged vows. "I do," he said, meaning it with everything he had left. They shared a brief kiss, the cold metal between them.

He knew their future was uncertain. But at that moment, Jake felt like the luckiest man alive. Mary had given him a chance at redemption.  He was ready to put the past behind him and become the man she deserved.

The Runaway

Emma raced down the street, clutching a bouquet in her trembling hands. Her wedding was due to start in fifteen minutes. But her fiancé wasn't the groom.

At the florist's shop, Emma changed out of her wedding gown and into jeans and a t-shirt. Her identity was sealed in an envelope with the gown. She left them behind. 

Emma boarded a bus without looking back, her engagement ring tucked deep in her pocket. "I do," she whispered, promising herself a new beginning where she could live on her own terms. 

There were calls she knew she must make once she reached her destination. But not yet. For now, all Emma could do was ride toward her hard-won freedom, leaving behind old dreams to forge new ones of her own choosing.
