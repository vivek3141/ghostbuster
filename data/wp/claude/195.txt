Archer Sterling sipped his whiskey neat and glanced around the smoky bar. His sources told him the target would be here tonight. He just had to be patient. 

Across the bar, James Bond nursed his vodka martini. Shaken, not stirred. His intelligence briefing indicated the assassin who was coming for him would be in this very establishment. He scanned the crowd, waiting for his moment.

Archer spotted his target in a dim corner, looking as dapper as the photos suggested. But the man's eyes gave him away. They were sharp, constantly scanning for threats. This was a man used to danger. 

A woman in a slinky red dress glided up to Bond's table. "May I have this drink, Mr. Bond?" she purred.

Bond gave a chilly smile. "I don't think so. I'm waiting for someone else tonight. But perhaps another time."

The woman walked off in a huff. Bond had neutralized the obvious honeypot. His assassin would have to do better than that.

Across the bar, Archer watched with grudging respect. The man was good. He would be a worthy opponent. 

Archer rose and strode over, drink still in hand. "Mr. Bond, I presume?" 

Bond raised an eyebrow. "Have we met?"

"Not formally. But our mutual friends suggested we should get acquainted." Archer put out his hand. 

After a beat, Bond shook it. "Our mutual friends have an odd sense of humor."

Archer noted Bond's solid grip, preparing to counter any sudden moves. "Quite. Care for a game of chance to make the evening interesting?"

"Why not?" Bond replied. "The stakes seem rather high with our line of work." 

"Indeed."  Archer sat across from Bond, not taking his eyes off the man for a second. Each recognized a professional in the other. But only one would walk away tonight. 

They played a hand of baccarat, doubling the stakes with each round. The game was close, but Bond prevailed. 

Archer shrugged, as if the loss was of no consequence.  "Well played. I suppose that concludes our business for the evening."

"For now." Bond raised his glass in a mocking salute.  

Archer matched the gesture and drained his drink. They had assessed each other, a precursor to their real match still to come. The game was afoot.

Archer left first. As Bond watched him go, he noticed Archer pass by a figure at the bar and swiftly pass a note. Interesting. It seemed tonight was just the opening move.

Bond finished his own drink without haste. While the other patrons laughed and argued and toasted, he had caught a glimpse of the shadows that lurked at the edge of the light. The shadows that men like him inhabited. The shadows that gave men like Archer Sterling their hunting ground. And soon, the hunt would begin in earnest.
