The twin suns of Khyron Prime began to rise over the mountain peaks, bathing the valley below in a warm orange glow. Most of the inhabitants of the small village were still sleeping, tucked away in their adobe huts and recovering from another hard day of work in the orchards and fields. 

Jenna awoke with a start as a loud bang echoed through the village. She rubbed the sleep from her eyes and peered out the window of her family’s hut, seeing a plume of smoke rising from the village center. Her little brother Khy shuffled up next to her, clutching his stuffed animal. “What’s happening, Jenna?” he asked.

“I don’t know,” she replied. In the 16 years since she was born in this village, she had never witnessed anything like this before. Her heart began to race.

As Jenna and Khy watched, a glowing blue portal opened up in the middle of the village square. But this was not the work of the village’s mages or sorcerers. Something emerged from the portal, a strange creature the likes of which she had never seen. It walked on two legs like a humanoid, but its skin was a pale pink and it was dressed in a shimmering red uniform. 

“Greetings, citizens of Khyron Prime,” the creature announced, its voice booming and authoritative. “Do not be afraid. I am Commander Graxis of the Interstellar Consortium. We come in peace.”

More creatures emerged from the portal, some carrying strange objects. The village elder, Caetha, approached them hesitantly. “Why have you come to our village?” she asked.

“We are here to collect a tithe,” Commander Graxis replied. “A tithe of your people’s consciousness and dream energies.”

Jenna glanced at Khy in confusion. What were they talking about?

“For millennia, your people have projected dream energy across space and time,” the commander continued. “You are potent dreamwalkers, and those energies are a valuable resource. My consortium harvests them from across the universe. It is now time to collect from your world.”

Caetha shook her head adamantly. “We will not provide you with our dream energies. They are tied to each soul and precious to us.”

Commander Graxis let out an exasperated sigh. "Then we will have to take them by force. Pity you could not cooperate." He nodded to his troops, who raised their strange devices and began firing beams of red energy at the villagers. One by one, the villagers collapsed to the ground, their dream energies siphoned away.

Jenna grabbed Khy and hid him under their sleeping pallets, placing a finger over her lips to indicate he should remain silent. Her heart pounded as a troop entered their hut, scanning the small space. 

Moments later the red-clad soldiers emerged from their hut and moved on through the village, having detected no remaining dream energies to harvest. The portal opened once more, and the invaders returned from whence they came.

A few hours later, Jenna emerged from hiding to find almost all of the villagers still unconscious. She rushed to Caetha's side, shaking the elder. "Wake up!" she cried.

Caetha's eyes opened slowly. "The dreamwalkers..." she murmured. "Now we understand why we were feared...and revered across the stars...”
