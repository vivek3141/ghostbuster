The ancient Elven kingdom of Sylvandale had mastered space travel centuries before the first Humans built their first village. Massive sleek ships transported Elves between their colonies on distant worlds. While the Elves explored the stars, the Dwarves delved deep into the mysteries of the physical world. Their unparalleled craftsmanship and technical skill led to the splitting of the atom, a feat of science that unlocked both abundant energy and unimaginable destruction. 

For a time, Elves and Dwarves progressed rapidly, their technologies and knowledge advancing far beyond the primitive Humans. But with progress came hubris and complacency. The Elves grew isolationist, focusing inward on their glittering space colonies and losing interest in their home world. The Dwarves’ pursuit of science became an end in itself, knowledge hoarded and rarely applied to solve real-world problems.

Humans, meanwhile, built villages, then towns, then kingdoms. They warred and made peace. Their knowledge and technologies built up slowly, through hard-won experience. While less advanced than the Elves or Dwarves, their societies remained vibrant and open.

A century after first contact between the races, the world looked as if little had changed. The Elven spaceports and Dwarven atom-forges lay abandoned, relics of a lost golden age. But in the Human lands, people lived and worked the land with simple tools their ancestors would have recognized.

It was the Humans’ capacity for humility, curiosity, and cooperation that allowed their societies to flourish while the others decayed. When the Elves and Dwarves emerged from their isolation, they found peoples they had once dismissed as primitive had surpassed them in wisdom and vitality. 

The Elven and Dwarven civilizations had been like a fire, bright and fierce but quick to burn out. But the slow, steady flame of Human progress proved longest-lasting. The grand technologies and knowledge of old may have been lost, but in this new world, one of simple villages and towns, wonders anew were being forged - and this time, by the hands and minds of all three peoples, working in harmony.
