The old cobblestone streets of the city were busy as always. People bustling to and fro, going about their daily lives. I enjoyed my evening walks through the city, observing the rhythms of everyday life. 

As I walked down a narrow street, I noticed something strange. People seemed to be recoiling away from a young woman walking in the opposite direction. She was striking, with pale skin, jet black hair, and wearing a simple black dress. Yet people grimaced as she walked by, some even crossing the street to avoid her.

Curious, I continued walking towards the woman. But as we approached each other, I felt nothing but calm. She had a kind, inviting smile and eyes that seemed full of depth and wisdom.

We walked past each other, but I couldn’t shake a feeling that something was off. I turned around and called out, “Excuse me, miss?”

She stopped and turned, her black dress swaying around her. “Yes?” she asked. Her voice was melodic but somber.

I caught up to her and asked, “I couldn’t help but notice people avoiding you as we walked by. Has something happened?”  

She sighed softly. “It is not me they are avoiding, but what I represent.” Seeing my confused look, she explained, “I am Death. Or rather, I am the way people visualize Death.”

I was stunned. "People visualize you in different ways?" 

She nodded. "To most, Death seems frightening or morbid. So they see me as sinister or ghastly.” She gestured down at her unassuming outfit. “To some, I appear in black robes and carrying a scythe."

"But not to me?" I asked.

She smiled warmly. “You seem to view Death in a kinder way. So to you, I appear as I wish to be - inviting and comforting.” 

I found myself smiling back. "You're quite beautiful." 

She laughed, a light bell-like sound. "That is not what most would say! But I am what people make of me. I merely guide souls to what comes next at the appointed time.” Her smile faded. “Though it can be lonely, appearing as a threat to so many.”

I placed a hand gently on her arm. "I do not see you as a threat. Merely as another part of life's journey."

Her smile returned as she placed her hand over mine. “Thank you. That gives me hope.” She let go of my hand and glanced up at the darkening sky. “Now I must continue on. There are other souls requiring guidance tonight.”

She began to walk away. At the end of the street, she turned back once more and smiled. I knew that no matter how Death appeared to others, to me she would always seem inviting. Guiding souls not with fear but with kindness to what lay beyond.
