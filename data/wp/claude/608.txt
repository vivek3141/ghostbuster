The old warehouse was filled with boxes and crates covered in a thick layer of dust. I had been tasked with helping my uncle clean out this building he had recently purchased. As I was rummaging through one of the boxes, I spotted something strange. There was a large Ziploc bag filled with small blue pills. I picked up the bag to get a closer look. Written on the pills was "NZT". 

My mind raced. NZTâ€”the fictional smart drug from the movie Limitless. This had to be some kind of joke or movie prop. But the pills looked so realistic. My curiosity got the better of me. I opened the bag and popped one of the pills in my mouth. 

At first, nothing happened. Then, slowly, my senses started to become sharper. Details I never noticed before suddenly jumped out at me. I felt a surge of energy and focus. My mind was racing, processing countless thoughts all at once. I realized with astonishment that these pills actually worked. They were real NZT.

This discovery filled me with a mix of excitement and dread. The potential power of these pills was enormous. But they were also clearly unstable and dangerous, especially if misused. I thought about the inevitable crash that would follow if I took one. And yet, the temptation to enhance my mind was intoxicating.

I knew I had to get rid of the pills. If anyone found out I had them, who knows what might happen. But could I really flush them all away? I stared at the bag in my hands, my mind wrestling with indecision. 

In the end, I dumped the entire contents of the bag into the trash. Those pills represented a power far beyond what any one person could handle responsibly. As I took one last look at the empty bag, a chill ran through me. I had narrowly avoided going down a path I would never have returned from. I tossed the bag and left that warehouse, filled with a renewed appreciation for the limits of my own mind.
