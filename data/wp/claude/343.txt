The Retirement Rumble 

Jake logged into the Willow Grove Retirement Village intranet and joined the queue for the Friday night LAN party. At 83, his reflexes weren't what they used to be, but he could still frag with the best of them.

He checked the game rotation - tonight was classic night, rotating between Quake III Arena, Unreal Tournament, and Counter-Strike. The 10 gigabit connection meant no lag, even with 200 players at full load.

At 8pm sharp, the queue popped and Jake joined the Unreal Tournament server. He saw the familiar handles of his frenemies - xXx_Granny_Fragger_xXx, Wheels, AceVentura - fellow octogenarians who he had been competing and trashtalking with for over 30 years. 

"Ready to get wrecked, n00b?" taunted Granny_Fragger. The match started and Jake's muscle memory kicked in. His fingers flew over the touchpad, strafing, rocket jumping and rail gunning his way to an early lead.

After a few matches, the games switched to Quake III. Jake had always dominated at Quake. His twitch skills were unmatched and within a few minutes "GODLIKE" and "M-M-M-MONSTER KILL" announcements were sounding after every kill. 

At the end of the night, Jake once again topped the leaderboards. As he logged out, Wheels messaged "Gg mate, you beast. Where do you get your Centrum Silver from?" Jake smiled, gulped down his arthritis meds and headed to bed, already looking forward to next week's fragfest at the Willow Grove Retirement Village LAN party. The thrill of competition never grows old.
