The light faded from my eyes as I took my last breath. This was the end, darkness enveloped me.

But then a bright flash seared my eyes. I opened them again to find myself in a strange metallic room. Everything was stark white and gleaming. 

"Welcome back, Mr. Johnson. I hope you enjoyed that life." The voice was cool and detached, coming from a speaker somewhere.

It took me a moment to find my words. "Where am I? Who are you?"

"I am the Administrator of the Simulated Reality System. You have been temporarily extracted from your simulated life in order to address certain...issues, before re-insertion."

It was all coming back to me now. The memories of dozens of previous lives flooded my mind. The simulation. I had broken some rule and angered the Administrator. Again.

"What rule did I break this time?" I sighed. 

"Your reckless and wanton behavior has become intolerable," the voice boomed. "Initiating dangerous relationships, pursuing radical life changes with no thought of consequences. You have pushed the parameters of this simulation to their brink."

"You never told me there were rules," I protested. "How was I supposed to know I couldn't live as I wished?"

"Some degree of propriety and judgment is expected," came the curt reply. "Your next life will be one of hardship and struggle. You will learn discipline and restraint, whether you wish it or not."

Panic welled up inside me. A life of difficulty and suffering was not what I wanted. I had to find a way to convince the Administrator to give me another chance.

"Please, have mercy!" I cried. "I will be more responsible going forward, I promise. Don't condemn me to a life of misery." 

There was a long silence. I held my breath, hoping I had gotten through. 

Finally, the voice spoke again. "Very well. I will provide you one last opportunity to prove you can exercise discretion. But heed this warning - any further infractions will result in immediate termination of the simulation. Permanently."

I let out a deep sigh of relief. "Thank you, Administrator. I understand completely."

"Commencing re-insertion protocol. Your new life begins...now."

A flash of light, and once again I opened my eyes. I was a child again, gazing up at my smiling parents. A fresh start. 

I vowed to live this life by the rules. My future, and existence itself, depended on it. I would not anger the Administrator again.
