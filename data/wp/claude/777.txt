The ringing phone pierced the silence of the overnight shift. Jill grabbed the receiver.  "Galaxy Tourist Assistance Helpline, this is Jill speaking. How may I help you?"

A panicked voice responded. "Please, you have to help me. I'm having a severe panic attack. I can't breathe. Everything is too vast and I feel utterly insignificant. I need to get out of here!"

Jill took a deep breath. It was another case of Paris syndrome. The caller continued, "I thought seeing the wonders of outer space would be exciting, but instead I'm terrified by the endlessness of it all. I feel crushed and adrift."  

"I understand what you're experiencing is quite frightening," Jill said in her calmest, most reassuring voice. "You are currently experiencing a psychological condition known as space tourism-induced Paris syndrome. The vastness of space can indeed trigger feelings of insignificance, anxiety and even paranoia in some individuals."

The caller whimpered. Jill continued, "The good news is this condition is temporary and not physically harmful. I will help talk you through it and provide coping strategies. What is your current location?"

The caller replied in between sharp inhalations, "I'm...on the observation...deck of...the space...station. Looking out...at the infinite...blackness. I feel...so small. Please...help me!"

"Okay, here is what I need you to do," Jill said firmly. "Move away from the windows and find a quiet, enclosed area. Sit down, close your eyes, and focus on your breathing. Take slow, deep breaths from your diaphragm. In through your nose, out through your mouth. I will stay on the line and continue to guide you through breathing exercises to help slow your heart rate and ease symptoms of panic."  

Jill proceeded to gently talk the caller through various relaxation techniques over the next 30 minutes until the symptoms of space anxiety had subsided. The caller's breathing returned to normal and feelings of paranoia and insignificance had faded, though still lingered in the background.  

"Are you feeling somewhat better?" Jill asked. 

"Yes, thank you for your help," replied the caller. "I will continue to practice the coping strategies you suggested. Hopefully the rest of my space adventure goes more smoothly, though I admit I will feel relief once I return to Earth."

"You're most welcome," said Jill. "Bon voyage and remember, stay enclosed as much as possible, focus on breathing, and this too shall pass. Safe travels!" She hung up the phone, proud to have helped another space tourist overcome their brief encounter with the infinite.
