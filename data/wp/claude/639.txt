The Final Departure 

Emma looked out the tiny porthole of the spaceship, gazing at the blue and green orb below. Earth. Her home for the last 83 years. Now barren and empty, devoid of human life.

Most humans had left over the last two decades, seeking new homes on distant worlds as Earth struggled under the weight of climate change and overpopulation. Massive spaceships had transported millions of people to colonies on Mars, Europa, Titan and beyond. 

Emma was part of the last wave, a handful of stragglers and nostalgics who had a hard time letting go of humanity's birthplace. But now Earth's time had come. Only Emma remained, insistently clinging to her lifelong home until the very end.

Her ship cruised in low orbit, preparing for the final jump to light speed that would whisk her away to a new colony in a distant star system. But still Emma's gaze remained fixed on the world below, awash in memories of a long life lived.

Her mind wandered over visions of sparkling blue oceans she once swam in, lush green forests she had hiked as a child, sandstone canyons she had explored in her youth. The memories were painful but sweet, a reminder of all that humanity was leaving behind on this lonely world. 

A alert sounded, signaling final preparation for the light speed jump. The autopilot began a 30 second countdown, waiting for Emma's final authorization. Still she lingered, her wrinkled fingers pressed against the porthole, eyes wet with tears.

Part of her yearned to stay behind, to live out her final days in the place she knew as home. But she knew that was impossible. The great cities had gone dark, infrastructure had crumbled, humanity's footprint erased. Earth was returning to the wild, a new evolutionary cycle beginning.

With a deep sigh, Emma blinked slowly and turned away from the porthole. Her gnarled hands typed in the authorization code on a glowing keypad.

"Jump approved. Commencing launch in 5...4...3...2...1."

There was a flash of light and a slight shuddering sensation. When Emma looked again through the porthole, the familiar orb of Earth had vanished. Empty space greeted her eyes.

She had done it. After 83 long years, she had left Earth behind. The final human had departed, releasing humanity's cradle back to the wilds of a new dawn. 

Earth was alone once more, waiting in the silence to be born anew. The future was unclear but seemed full of hope. Both for the planet being left behind and the human venturing out into the unknown.
