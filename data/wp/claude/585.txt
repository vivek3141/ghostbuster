The knight stood in chains before the Royal Court, dozens of suspicious eyes upon him. His king, the man he had devoted his life to serving, lay dead. And now he was accused of the unthinkable: regicide. But he knew the truth. 

He spoke: “Good lords and ladies, I come before you falsely accused. I loved my king and would never harm him. His death was not by my hand, but by his jealous wife, the Queen!”

A shocked gasp arose. The Queen shrieked in protest, “Lies! This man is clearly mad with guilt!” 

The knight continued, “The King's affections had turned from the Queen to a young maid. The Queen feared she would lose her crown and station to this younger, fairer woman. So she conspired to have the King murdered, and cast the blame on me, his most loyal subject, to avoid suspicion.”

The lords and ladies muttered to each other. This was a startling claim, but not outside the realm of possibility. 

The Queen scoffed, “Preposterous! I loved my husband dearly. I had no reason to wish him harm. This man grasps at straws to save his own skin.”

The knight said, “If that were true, why was the King's personal guard dismissed just before he was slain? By whose order were they sent away? And look—even now, the Queen does not weep at hearing of her husband's death. Her eyes are dry as stone.”

More murmurs. The Queen's stoicism was strange and unsettling. But this knight's word alone was not enough.

The Queen rose imperiously. “I will not justify these outrageous accusations by defending myself further. My grief is mine alone. This man has spouted nothing but lies and slander, and should be executed for it!” 

The lords conferred. While the knight had raised some troubling questions, there was no hard evidence. The Queen was well loved by her people. The knight's claims seemed self-serving, a desperate attempt to avoid consequences.

The chief lord stood. “We have found no cause to believe your claims. You stand accused of murdering your king, and are hereby sentenced to death. May the gods have mercy on your soul."

The knight bowed his head. He had failed, and now would lose his own life. But at least he would die knowing the truth: the Queen was a murderous tyrant, and her bloody reign over the kingdom had begun. His last comfort was imagining her reacting to the news of his sentence, hiding her sinister smile behind a veil of false tears. He could only hope that one day, others would see through her deceit and bring about a just end to her rule.
