The Colors Fade

Jenny stared at her blank canvas, paintbrush in hand, waiting for inspiration to strike. But the colors seemed muted, the vibrancy lost. She squeezed more red onto her palette, but even the brightest crimson seemed dull. 

All the color in the world was slowly fading, and no one could accurately predict how much longer until there would be no color at all. Scientists were alarmed at the phenomenon but couldn’t determine the cause. Conspiracy theorists abounded with explanations, but none were proven.

As an artist, Jenny felt the loss of color deeply. How could she express emotion and passion without the vivid yellow of the sun, the deep blue of the sky, the bright green of new spring leaves? She wondered if there was any point to painting a colorless world. Many other artists were struggling with the same realization and had given up their craft in despair.  

Jenny wasn’t ready to quit just yet. Art was too central to her identity, her purpose. Instead, she would work with the colors she had left and push them to their fullest potential. She started adding hints of blue to her reds, touches of yellow to her purples. The resulting shades were complex and nuanced. Rather than photorealism, she aimed for impressionism. Her paintings became more conceptual, focusing on shape, form and texture.

As the remaining colors grew muddier, Jenny began incorporating mixed media into her work. Collage, charcoal sketches and found materials supplemented her palettes. Her pieces grew more layered and multidimensional. While fully saturated colors were vibrant and joyful, Jenny found a poignant beauty in the subtle and the textured. There was art to be made not just from what was present, but from what was being lost.  

Other artists took note of Jenny’s new approach and followed her lead. They formed collectives to share materials and ideas for stretching their limited resources. In the face of a colorless world, the art community grew stronger, bonded by their shared passion and loss. Art became an act of defiance, a way to protest against the bleak homogeneity seeping into the world.   

The day finally came when Jenny opened her last tube of crimson and squeezed out the final drop. Her heart ached at its passing. But in that moment she realized, though color had faded, her creativity had not. Art was not diminished, merely changed. Her brush could still sweep the canvas, her hands mold clay. Beauty would endure, in contours and forms, lights and shadows, textures and layers. Though the world was greying, she would continue to find inspiration. The colors may be gone, but the art lived on.  

Jenny washed her brushes, packed away her paints and picked up a piece of charcoal. Filling her lungs with air, she turned to a fresh canvas and began to sketch. There was still so much left to create. The end of color was not the end of the world—or the end of art. Her journey was not over; it had only just begun.
