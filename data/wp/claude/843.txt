Freddy Krueger was in high spirits. He had selected his next victim, a disturbed young man who called himself "The Joker". From what Freddy could tell by glimpsing into the man's unhinged mind, this Joker character seemed an ideal target. His madness and twisted psyche would make him particularly susceptible to Freddy's brand of terror. 

Under the cover of night, Freddy descended into the surreal landscape of the Joker's dreams. But from the moment he entered, something felt off. The dreamscape felt more chaotic and nonsensical than usual. Distorted carnival music was playing, the colors were too bright, and nothing seemed to follow any internal logic or pattern.

Freddy stalked through the bizarre dream, looking for the Joker. He found him, but the Joker just laughed maniacally upon seeing Freddy and his bladed glove.

"Oooh, the pizza-face killer guy! Are you lost, little dream demon?" The Joker cackled. 

"I'm here for you, Joker," Freddy growled. He slashed at the Joker with his blades but the Joker dodged swiftly while pulling out a comically large cartoon mallet. He swung it hard, slamming Freddy through a brick wall. 

Freddy shook off the shock and attacked again, only for the Joker to disappear in a cloud of toxic-looking gas. The gas began to fill up the whole dreamscape.

Freddy started coughing and choking, his eyes stinging. The gas was affecting him somehow, even though this was only a dream. His powers felt dampened.

The Joker reappeared, wearing a gas mask and still grinning. "Having fun yet? I don't think my mind is very dream-invader friendly. The nonsense in here tends to drive most intruders quite mad!"

Freddy lunged at the Joker in rage and panic, but his slashes passed harmlessly through the cackling madman. He realized with dawning horror that he was powerless here. 

The Joker strode up and patted Freddy mockingly on the cheek. â€œBetter luck next time, pizza-face! Now if you'll excuse me, I have more important chaos and madness to get back to. Toodles!"

With that Freddy was violently ejected from the dream. He awoke disoriented and weakened in his boiler room. His left arm was still tingling from where the mallet had struck. Never before had his powers failed him so completely within someone's dream. 

Freddy scowled, anger and unease warring within him. He had badly underestimated his intended prey. The mind of the Joker was too deranged and surreal a place for even Freddy's darkness to gain purchase. He would not be entering those nightmarrescapes again anytime soon. The clown had beaten him at his own game, twisting the rules of dreams and turning the hunters into the hunted.   

Freddy brooded on this embarrassing turn of events. For now, he would have to add The Joker to the list of souls he was unable to claim. The twisted figure of the smiling madman would haunt what was left of Freddy's conscience for a long time to come.
