The doors shook as the mob outside pounded against them. John knew it was only a matter of time before they burst through. He wiped the sweat off his brow and looked around the server room, filled with rows of whirring machines. His eyes rested on the master server in the center—the heart of Reddit. 

John had tried reasoning with the protesters when they first arrived. “Reddit brings people together! It spreads ideas and connects the world!” he argued. But they didn't listen. They were convinced that Reddit had become a place that spread misinformation and manipulated public discourse. One by one, governments around the globe had banned the website until it became a shadow of its former self.

Now the mob outside wanted to pull the plug once and for all. As head moderator, the task fell to John to shut Reddit down—and end an era of human connection and open exchange of information. His fingers hesitated over the power button.

Just then, the doors burst open with a crash. Dozens of people flooded into the room, shouting and waving crudely made signs. In seconds the moderators were surrounded, cut off from the master server. 

A woman stepped forward, her eyes flashing with anger as she turned to John. “Do it. Shut this monstrosity down! Reddit has caused enough harm in the world.” The mob erupted into cheers of approval.

John's eyes flicked across the room, taking in the space he had helped build and nurture for over a decade. This was more than a website to him—it was a community. A home. His fingers ran along the edge of the power button as he shook his head bitterly. “I can’t do it. I won't let Reddit die.”

The woman's eyes narrowed. She shoved John aside and without a moment's hesitation pressed the power button. The droning hum of the servers faded into silence.

Reddit was gone. The mob cheered even as John collapsed to the floor. An era had ended, but in that moment all John could think of was the community that had just gone dark—and the uncertain future ahead without the curious little website that had once connected so many.
