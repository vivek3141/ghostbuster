The old sailor took a ragged breath, tasting the salt of the sea one last time. His weathered hands gripped the rail of his faithful ship as it rocked gently in the harbor.

His first mate approached hesitantly. "Captain, the crew wanted you to know, it has been an honor sailing with you all these years." 

The captain smiled, eyes still on the horizon. "The honor was mine. The sea is in my blood, she's the only woman I've ever loved."

"What should we do now?" asked the first mate. The unspoken hung in the air - this was the end.

The captain squared his shoulders, the familiar weight of command settling over him. "Set sail for open waters. I'll not die anchored like some landlubber. I belong out there, where the waves crest endlessly and adventure still lives."

As the sails unfurled and caught the wind, the captain breathed in deep. "To live and die at sea. That's the only fate fit for an old sailor like me." And with that, a smile on his lips and the sea in his heart, the captain closed his eyes for the final time.
