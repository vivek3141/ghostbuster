The Time Traveling Native 

Black Eagle clutched the amulet in his hands and took a deep breath. His grandfather had warned him of the power of the stone, that it allowed the wearer to traverse time itself. But at 20 years old, Black Eagle was brash and curious. He slipped the cord over his head and felt a rush of energy as the world around him dissolved into a sea of colors and sounds. 

When the chaos cleared, he found himself in a familiar forest. But there were strange smells in the air, smells of things burning and animals he did not recognize. In the distance, he heard the shouts of men, but they spoke a strange tongue. 

Black Eagle walked toward the sounds and spotted a settlement of wooden buildings surrounded by a wall. The men milling about wore odd black robes and peculiar hats. These must be the newcomers, the Pilgrims his grandfather had warned him about.

Two men spotted Black Eagle and approached him, hands on their muskets. They were clearly alarmed at his presence. Black Eagle raised his hands to show he meant no harm. One Pilgrim shouted words he did not comprehend, but the intentions were clear. They escorted him into their village.

The Pilgrims gawked and stared as he was brought before a man clearly their leader. “I come in peace,” Black Eagle said, hoping his intent would translate.  The leader nodded cautiously. 

Black Eagle looked around at the meager dwellings and farmers. These were not conquerors seeking to destroy, but families seeking refuge. His grandfather had warned him of the coming tide of men who would sweep his people away. But in this moment, he saw only kindred souls trying to build lives anew, bonding over a shared harvest.

The leader offered Black Eagle a plate of unfamiliar foods—fowl, corn, vegetables. He recognized nothing, but accepted gratefully. In that moment, watching his hosts share their bounty, Black Eagle hoped this encounter of kindred spirits might be the first step towards a new shared future between their peoples.  He slipped away when he was able and returned to a home both familiar yet forever changed. His grandfather again warned him of the future to come. But Black Eagle held onto the hope of that moment when two tribes broke bread in peace.
