The Mediocre Menace vs. The Subpar Savior  

Jake sighed as he looked in the mirror, adjusting his ill-fitting spandex costume. The lime green and mustard yellow material clung tightly to his scrawny body, accentuating his complete lack of muscle tone. 

"You can do this, you're a superhero now," he said, trying to psych himself up as he did before every patrol. 

He flung open the window of his suburban condo and leapt out into the night, ready to fight crime with the remarkable power he had recently discovered - the ability to make any small object levitate up to 6 inches off the ground for up to 3 seconds.

Bounding across rooftops, Jake scanned the dimly lit streets below for any signs of wrongdoing. He didn't have to search long before noticing a ominous figure in an equally absurd crimson and charcoal costume skulking by an ATM, muttering and gesturing dramatically. 

It was his nemesis, The Mediocre Menace, endowed with the sinister superpower of making ATM receipts catch on fire for a few seconds. Jake swooped down, attempting a superhero landing but stumbling awkwardly on impact. 

The Mediocre Menace turned with a snarl. "You again, Subpar Savior! And here I thought I'd get away with a quick cash withdrawal and arson this evening." 

Jake struck what he thought was an intimidating pose, ready to face off. "Not on my watch, Menace! Your reign of mildly inconvenient petty crimes ends now!"

The Mediocre Menace gestured emphatically, his eyes glowing red as the ATM receipt erupted into flames. Jake concentrated with all his might, managing to lift the burning slip of paper nearly 4 inches off the ground for a solid 5 seconds before it fluttered back down, singed but intact.

They both stared at the remains of the receipt, each shocked and infuriated the other's power had prevailed. The Mediocre Menace recovered first, aiming a poorly executed spin kick at Jake who just barely dodged. 

Jake grabbed a section of loose gravel from the alley, struggling with all his focus to lift the tiny rocks towards his opponent. After a few seconds of intense strain, they jiggled upwards about an inch then dropped, clattering uselessly to the ground.

The Mediocre Menace cackled. "You'll have to do better than that, Subpar Savior! My mediocrity knows no limits!" He swept his cape dramatically turning to stride away.

Jake panicked. He couldn't let his nemesis escape again without a proper showdown. In a burst of determination, he lifted a metal trash can lid a full 8 inches off the ground, hurtling it through the air where it glanced off the back of the Mediocre Menace's head with a hollow bong.

The Mediocre Menace collapsed to the ground, unconscious. Jake could hardly believe it. He had finally defeated his rival! The city was safe once again thanks to the Subpar Savior! 

 His victory was short lived as the lid clattered back to the ground. But for one night, Jake's subpar superpowers were enough. The citizens could sleep soundly again.
