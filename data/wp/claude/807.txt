The old doctor hummed a little tune as he prepared the injection. I sat on the exam table, rolling up my sleeve. "Just a little prick now," he said in his kind, grandfatherly tone. 

The needle touched my upper arm. But instead of piercing the skin, it bent sideways. The doctor blinked in confusion. "That's strange. Must have hit at a funny angle."

He tried again with a new needle. Same result. It was as if my arm had an invisible force field protecting it.

The doctor frowned. I felt a wave of unease. "Try again," I said, keeping my voice steady.  

On the third try, the needle shattered. Silence filled the room as we both stared at the broken needle on the floor. A chill ran down my spine.

After a long moment, the doctor spoke in a hushed tone. "I don't understand. In all my years...the PVP has always worked. No blade can pierce with intent to harm."

The PVP, or Permanent Violence Prohibition, nanites were embedded in every human at birth. They generated an energy field that prevented any object from damaging human tissue when there was harmful intent. For decades, they had eliminated all violence and accidental harm. Wars, assaults, even papercuts were things of the past.

Until now.

The doctor met my gaze, his kindly eyes now filled with fear. I shrank back, suddenly distrustful of this man who had cared for me since I was a child. What if he had wanted to harm me? Would his hypodermic needle have slid in effortlessly? A chilling thought occurred to me: what if the PVP was no longer active for me? Was I now vulnerable to any person's violent urges or wrath?  

I slid off the exam table, pulling down my sleeve. "I have to go," I stammered. Before the doctor could protest, I hurried out of the clinic and rushed home.

My mind was in turmoil. How was this possible? The PVP was foolproof, guaranteed to remain effective for life. If it had failed for me, how many others were also at risk? I thought of my wife and children and felt a sharp stab of fear. Were they still protected?

At home, my wife could see the panic on my face. I told her what happened at the doctor's office, my voice trembling. Her eyes widened in alarm, but she tried to reassure me. "It must be some mistake. Maybe the PVP just needs to be re-calibrated for you. We'll take you to the hospital right away."

I nodded, wanting desperately to believe her, that this was all some temporary glitch that the technicians could fix. We gathered our kids and headed to the nearby hospital. 

My hands were clammy as I walked up to the hospital counter. The clerk greeted us with a friendly smile. "How can I help you today?"

I opened my mouth to explain the situation, but found I couldn't form the words. The thought of telling a complete stranger I had lost the protection of the PVP field and might now be vulnerable to harm felt unthinkable. I glanced at my wife, silently pleading for help.  

She gave me a reassuring nod and turned to the clerk. "We need to see the technician. It's an emergency." Her calm manner belied the worry I saw etched on her face.

The clerk's eyebrows rose in alarm. "Right away, please come with me." Within minutes, we were ushered into an exam room.

My heart pounded as I awaited the technician. I had trusted in the infallibility of the PVP my whole life. Now, in a split moment, that trust had shattered. I feared what might come next, for me and my family. The only thing I knew for certain was that our lives would never be the same.
