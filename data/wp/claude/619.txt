It was an ordinary Tuesday morning that gave no indication it would be a day unlike any other. As I went through my usual routine—brewing a pot of coffee, checking my emails, browsing the news— little did I know that for a fleeting moment, the world would stand still.  

According to probability, there was a minuscule chance, 1 in 100 billion, that for a single second every person on the planet would be asleep or blink at the exact same time. Statistically improbable, yet still possible in a world of nearly 8 billion people going about their day, blinking and dozing as humans do.

As I sipped my coffee, eying the clock to ensure I left for work on time, that improbable moment arrived. For 1/10 of a second, every man, woman and child on the Earth, every Buddhist monk in meditation and insomniac staring at the ceiling, every pilot in the sky and surgeon in the operating room, we all closed our eyes. 

In that blink, we shared a strange and fleeting darkness. A universal blindness that connected us all in a way no catastrophe could. There were no divisions of race or religion or wealth, just a shared experience of nothingness as our eyes shut out the light.

And in the next moment, the world returned as our eyes reopened once more. The familiar and comforting light streamed in, and life resumed its pace.  

But in that tiny sliver of time, as we were all sewn together in the dark, what transpired? What did we all miss?

For most, the moment came and passed without notice or meaning. A microsecond of existence that left no imprint on memory or consciousness.

Yet for some, perhaps that instant held a glimpse of revelation or insight. As eyes closed, a long-sought solution appeared in the mind's eye, or a flash of creativity sparked, or a flicker of joy warmed the heart.  

And for a precious few, maybe time itself seemed to slow and stretch in that quiet darkness. An opportunity to connect with something greater than oneself, to find peace in shared stillness.  

We'll never know what really transpired in that improbable moment. The world kept turning, and life marched on as before. But if we're lucky enough to witness such a moment again, I hope we have the presence of mind to pause, to reflect on our shared humanity, and to open ourselves to the revelations that can emerge from darkness.
