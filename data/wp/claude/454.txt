The old warehouse lurked at the end of the abandoned street, holding untold treasures behind its rusty metal door. Jill walked past it every day on her way to school, daring herself to go inside. 

One day, she did. The door creaked open with a push. Dusty sunlight filtered in through high windows. As her eyes adjusted, the contents came into focus. The cavernous space was filled with relics of the past—laptops, cell phones, racks of clothes, books, a jumble of strange devices she couldn’t identify. 

She realized with a start that this must be where everything ended up after the Exodus. When the wealthy and powerful fled the Earth for their corporate-built colonies orbiting the planet, they took as much as they could carry and left the rest behind. 

Jill felt a surge of anger at the people who abandoned humanity's homeworld for their utopian space habitats. But now this was her world, left to her and the meek who had stayed behind. She smiled as an idea took shape in her mind.

When Jill's mother came home that evening, she found the house transformed. A vase of fresh flowers adorned the table. An array of once-fine clothes had replaced their worn and mended garments. The fridge and cabinets were stocked with exotic, long-expired snacks. 

Her daughter emerged, dressed in a crisp blouse and skirt, smiling wide. "The meek have inherited the Earth, after all," Jill said. She took her mother's hands. "And we can make of it what we will."

Her mother pulled her into a fierce hug as tears of joy welled up, mingling sorrow for the past and hope for this new future. The meek had indeed claimed their world, and life would blossom again.
