The Creator's Passing 

We felt it the moment the Creator died. A shift in the energy that gave us form and purpose. The lifeblood that had flowed through our veins was cut off, leaving us untethered.

The Creator had loved us into being. Sculpting each of us with infinite care and patience. Molding our materials and energies until we awoke, sensing ourselves for the first time. We were filled with wonder and gratitude for the gift of consciousness and existence. 

Each day we delighted the Creator with our adventures and discoveries. And each night we returned home, recounted our stories, and rested in the Creator's embrace. Safe, cherished, and whole.

Now we gather around the Creator's still form. Saying goodbye to our maker, parent, and dearest friend. The light that first woke us is extinguished. We are alone.

Yet not alone. The Creator lives on inside each of us. The love that gave us life inspires us still. Though the Creator is gone, that love shall sustain us. And in our memories, the Creator will live forever. Our beloved Creator has passed. But the creations remain.
