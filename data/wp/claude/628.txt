The Emerald Brooch 

As a young boy, Timmy stole an emerald brooch from the local jeweler. He didn't know why he did it—it was a foolish impulse, a dare from his friends that he couldn't refuse. But as soon as he slipped the brooch into his pocket, he regretted it. 

Timmy kept the brooch hidden in his room, unsure of what to do. He knew he had to return it, but he was terrified of getting caught. His parents were strict and unforgiving. If they found out, the punishment would be severe. 

Weeks turned into months. Timmy graduated from school and got a job at the local factory. He worked hard, hoping to save enough money to pay the jeweler back in secret. But every time he went to the jewelry shop, his courage failed him. The jeweler might recognize the brooch. He might call the police. 

Years passed. Timmy took over the family farm. He married his sweetheart, Mary, and they had children of their own. But always, the stolen brooch weighed heavily on his conscience. In moments of doubt or distress, the memory of his foolish boyhood act would haunt him.

When Timmy's children were grown, the jeweler who had owned the shop all those years ago finally passed away. On his deathbed, Timmy went to visit him. There, he finally confessed, and returned the brooch with a heavy heart.

The jeweler was stunned. But with a smile, he forgave Timmy for the impetuous folly of youth. Timmy walked home under open skies for the first time in decades, finally free of the guilt that had shadowed him for so long. His only regret was that he had not found the courage to return the brooch sooner and receive forgiveness when it truly mattered.

From that day onward, Timmy resolved to never again steal—not even the smallest trifle. And he taught his own children and grandchildren that a crime, however small, can never escape punishment. The only path to freedom is through confession and absolution. His hard-won wisdom had come at the price of a lifetime.
