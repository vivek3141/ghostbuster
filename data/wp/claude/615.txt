Batman lurked in the shadows of the abandoned warehouse, waiting for the Joker to emerge. His archenemy had been planning something big, and Batman had been tracking him for weeks. Now, finally, he had the Joker cornered. 

As Batman peered around a corner, he suddenly felt a rumbling in his gut. His eyes went wide. Not now, he thought. He couldn't risk leaving his position, not when he was so close. But the rumbling intensified, and he knew he wouldn't be able to ignore it for long.

Just then, the Joker strode into view, flanked by two of his goons. "Get the truck loaded up, boys!" he cackled. "We've got a big night ahead of us!"

Batman saw his chance. He leapt from the shadows, dispatching the goons with two quick blows. Before the Joker could react, Batman grabbed him and pinned him against a wall.

"It's over, Joker," Batman growled. But then his stomach gurgled loudly. A look of confusion crossed the Joker's face, then it lit up in a sinister smile. 

"Well, well, the Dark Knight has an urgent appointment with the royal throne!" the Joker laughed. Batman scowled, his cheeks reddening under his mask. 

"I always knew you were human under that pointy-eared mask," the Joker taunted. "How delightfully humiliating this must be!" 

Batman slammed the Joker against the wall again, fighting against the raging storm in his abdomen. "Shut up," he snapped.

"My, my, no need to get crabby," said the Joker. "We all have our basic needs. Why don't you just nip off to the little vigilante's room and take care of business?"

Batman grimaced. As much as he hated to admit it, the Joker was right. His body wasn't going to wait any longer. 

Keeping one hand firmly on the Joker, Batman reached to his utility belt with the other and grabbed a pair of handcuffs. He cuffed the Joker to a metal support beam.

"Don't go anywhere," Batman said gruffly. The Joker just threw his head back with raucous laughter.

Batman hurried off into the shadows, cursing under his breath, knowing the Joker would never let him forget this and already dreading the barrage of potty jokes he was sure to face in their next encounter. But for now, his bowels had top priority. His showdown with the Joker would just have to wait.
