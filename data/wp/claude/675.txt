I slowly opened my eyes, confused by the unfamiliar white ceiling above me. This wasn't my room. I sat up with a start, taking in the sparse furnishings and grey walls surrounding me. A metal-framed bed, a small desk and chair, and a locked door. Where was I? 

Panic started to rise in my chest as I swung my legs over the side of the bed. My shoes were by the door, so I slipped them on and cautiously tried the handle. Locked. Of course. 

I pounded on the door, shouting for help. After a few minutes of fruitless yelling, I slumped onto the bed, my mind racing. The last thing I remembered was going to bed in my own room, in my own time. Now here I was, trapped in what seemed to be an early 20th century insane asylum.

A small window in the upper part of the wall let in the only natural light. I peered through the thick glass, seeing a cobblestone courtyard a few stories below. In the distance, I could make out a bustling city street. Cars and fashion seemed to indicate I was in the 1920s, but how on earth did I get here?

At the sound of a key in the lock, I leapt to my feet. A nurse in a prim white uniform entered, her expression stern. 

"Who are you? Where am I? Why am I locked in here?" I demanded, struggling to keep the panic from my voice. 

"You were admitted here last night in a state of hysteria and delusion," she replied briskly. "You'll remain in observation until the doctors clear you for release. Your meals will be brought regularly. I suggest remaining calm and compliant."

With that, she shut the door firmly behind her, locking it once again. I sank to the floor, head in my hands. This couldn't be real. It had to be a dream. I pinched myself, hard, but nothing changed. I was still trapped in this tiny room in the past. 

A few hours later, a tray with a meager meal of broth and bread was shoved through a slit at the bottom of the door. My hunger eventually overcame my desire to not cooperate, and I ate the bland fare. As night fell, dim lights in the hallway outside my room were turned on, though my cell remained dark save for the bit of moonlight through the window. Exhausted both physically and mentally, I fell into a fitful sleep on the hard bed.

The next day followed much the same. Long hours of waiting, reading the few tattered books that had been left in the desk, peering out the window at the world moving on without me. My second meal was brought, again pushed through the slot in the door. As the nurse's footsteps retreated down the hall, I heard a faint voice call out "Is someone new there? Please, talk to me!"

I rushed to the door, dropping to my knees to peer through the meager opening. "Hello? Who are you?" I asked hesitantly.

A sigh of relief. "My name is Mary. I woke a fortnight ago in this place, with no memory of how I arrived. The doctors say I'm delusional, that I believe I'm from the future, but I know I'm not mad. Are you...not of this time, as well?" Her voice dropped to a whisper.

My heart leapt. I wasn't alone! "No, I...I'm not. I fell asleep in the 21st century. Oh, please tell me you're from the future too!" I exclaimed. Mary let out a little laugh, giddy with shared knowledge of the truth. We talked for hours, sharing details of our lives before waking in this terrible place, bonding over our bizarre and frightening predicament. At least now, we had each other.

At the end of the hall, around a corner out of sight of the main nurses' station, was a large ward for the presumed most incurable cases. As Mary described it, everyone there claimed to be from another time, thrown into this era against their will and trapped by doctors who refused to believe their stories. All except one man, who never spoke or responded to anyone. He was the first patient confined there, and seemed to have been in a near-catatonic state since his arrival many years ago. I shuddered at the thought of that being my fate.

Mary and I promised to talk whenever we could, to give each other comfort during the long and lonely hours where uncertainty was our only companion. We didn't know how this came to be, or if we'd ever make it back home, but we had found kindred spirits to share the weight of this unfathomable reality. As I lay in the darkness that night, I smiled into the blackness, feeling less alone than I had since waking into this nightmare. I may be locked away, but I held tight to the key of hope Mary had given me today. The future was uncertain, but for now I knew I had a friend in this asylum out of time.
