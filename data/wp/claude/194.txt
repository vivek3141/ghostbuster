The empty bottle slipped from my fingers and shattered on the floor. The jagged glass reflected a broken man staring back at me. Bloodshot eyes, unshaven face, a trembling mess. When did I become this? 

Another drink. Just one more. That's what I told myself so many times before. One more to numb the pain, silence the demons in my head. But one drink led to two, two led to three, and now here I am - drowning in an ocean of scotch with no rescue in sight.

I tried to quit. I really did. The shakes, the cravings, the nausea - I endured it all for a few days. But sobriety felt like a prison and I longed for the escape of sweet oblivion. So I fell off the wagon again. And again. A vicious cycle I can't break.

The bottle didn't shatter. I did. Shattered into a million pieces with each gulp, my hopes and dreams dissolving in the amber liquid. No one can save me now. The man I was is gone, leaving behind this shadow that only resembles me. 

I'm tired. Tired of fighting and losing each day. There's only one way to be free of this prison. No more pain, no more anguish, no more waking to confront the disappointment in the mirror. I welcome the darkness.

No one will mourn the man I've become. But maybe they'll remember me as I once was. Before life dealt me this cruel hand. Before I crawled into the bottle and never came back out. 

Goodbye. I'm sorry I wasn't strong enough. But now at last, I'll be at peace.
