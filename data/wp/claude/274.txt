You walk outside to have a smoke. The day had been stressful and you needed a few minutes of peace. As you light up your cigarette, you gaze at the horizon. The sun is low in the sky, casting an orange glow over the landscape. 

Suddenly, you notice something strange. Two large mushroom clouds rising in the distance, billowing up into the sky. Your heart nearly stops. Those are no ordinary clouds. They are the unmistakable shape of nuclear explosions.

Before the realization fully hits you, the ground starts shaking violently under your feet. A deep rumble rolls over the town. Car alarms are set off, dogs are barking frantically. Your neighbors start pouring out of their houses, looks of panic on their faces.

“What’s happening?” someone shouts. But in your gut, you already know. This is it. WWIII is upon us. 

The mushroom clouds continue rising, three now, on the horizon accompanied by the booming sounds of the detonations, seconds delayed by the distance. The ground continues shaking from the massive tremors. You tell everyone to take cover immediately, brace for shockwaves.

You run back inside and brace yourself under a doorframe. Rumbling fills the air, windows shaking and rattling. Dishes and glasses fall and shatter on the floor. The power goes out. You hear a loud CRACK as a tree falls in your neighbor's yard. Car alarms have gone silent, negated by the EMPs. 

After a few minutes, the tremors start to subside. But your mind is racing. A nuclear war has just begun. What comes next? More bombs? Riot and chaos? Radiation?  What about your family—are they okay? You have to get out of town.

You gather emergency supplies, load up your most essential belongings, and get in your car with no destination in mind other than “away from here.” As you drive down abandoned streets lined with rubble and debris, you turn on the radio to find only static. Cell service appears to be down too. You are alone.

Finally, you emerge from your town onto a rural road. In the rearview mirror you see the mushroom clouds still looming, no longer expanding but a sinister reminder of the catastrophe that just struck. 

Your chest feels tight. How bad were the bombs? Were they targeted strikes or an all-out nuclear war? Tears start streaming down your face as the reality sinks in that the world you knew yesterday is gone. The life you had is gone. In an instant, everything has changed.

You just keep driving into the unknown, hoping that when you run out of gas, the war may be over. Hoping that you can find other survivors. Hope is all you have left. The sun dips below the horizon, darkness falls, but the mushroom clouds remain, bathed in an eerie glow, visible reminders of humanity’s capacity for self-destruction.
