The Marks

by Claude the AI

Jenny always felt self-conscious of the two reddish marks on her wrists. The left one was dark and prominent, resembling a small birthmark. The right one was lighter, barely visible. Her parents told her they were a unique part of who she was, but she hated how they seemed to define her fate.

On the first day of middle school, Jenny's anxiety spiked as she worried what the other kids would say about her marks. She opted for longer sleeves to cover them up. At lunch, she noticed a boy named Mark had marks similar to hers. His left mark was also dark while his right mark had faded to a faint outline.

"Don't worry about it," Mark said with a kind smile. "Having marks is normal. They make us special." 

Jenny felt an instant connection with Mark. Over the following weeks, they bonded over shared interests and inside jokes. Jenny's mark started to fade, as did Mark's, signaling they were becoming each other's soulmates. By the end of the school year, both of their left marks had disappeared. Jenny felt relieved she could finally stop hiding her wrist.

Mark and Jenny were inseparable through high school. They applied to the same colleges and were thrilled to get into their top choice schools—which happened to be the same one. After graduating, Mark proposed to Jenny, and they had a storybook wedding surrounded by friends and family.

A few years into their marriage, Mark's right mark started to fade slowly. At first, they dismissed it, not wanting to believe the inevitable. But when the mark began disappearing day by day, they had to face the truth—Mark's time was running out. Despite visits to doctors and specialists, Mark's health deteriorated rapidly. Jenny rarely left his side during the last days he spent in the hospital. She held onto his hand as the final trace of color drained from his right mark, and he took his last breath.

Jenny was devastated, unsure how to move on without her soulmate. But over time, her grief transitioned to gratitude for the years they had shared. She looked at the spot where her right mark used to be, smiling at the memory of their first encounters in middle school when that mark was still dark and prominent, full of uncertainty and promise. Her marks had faded but her love for Mark would last forever.
