The elevator doors slid open with a hiss. Jenna stepped in, engrossed in her phone, and hit the button for the 12th floor. The doors closed.

As the elevator climbed, something in the corner caught Jenna's eye. A vacuum cleaner stood upright, as if someone had left it there. Odd.

She walked over and examined it. It was an older model, metallic gray, with an oversized dust bag. 

Just then, the elevator shook violently and the lights went out. Jenna gasped as total darkness enveloped her. She groped for the control panel but couldn't find any buttons. 

A loud whirring noise started, like the vacuum had turned on by itself. Jenna shrank into the corner, heart pounding. 

The whirring grew deafening. There was a sudden rush of air and Jenna felt the floor drop away beneath her. She flailed in empty space, then landed roughly on solid ground.

The lights flickered on. Jenna found herself in a cavernous room with dozens of elevators lining the walls. Alien creatures were servicing the elevators, and in the center a wormhole glowed and spun.

Her breath caught in her throat as the truth dawned on her. The elevator was never meant to reach the 12th floor. And that ancient vacuum cleaner did a lot more than just clean.
