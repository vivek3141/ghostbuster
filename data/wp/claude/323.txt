The old stone bridge arched over the churning river, connecting the path through the forest on either side. I had been hiking for hours and was eager to make it to the other side and set up camp for the night. 

As I stepped onto the bridge, a low gravelly voice rang out: "Halt! Who dares cross my bridge?"

I froze in place. A large figure emerged from the shadows under the bridge, blocking the way across. It was a troll, about eight feet tall, with green scaly skin and a long tangled beard. His eyes gleamed with cunning. 

"I apologize, sir troll, I did not mean to intrude," I stammered. "I'm just trying to get to the other side of the forest."

The troll grunted. "Not so fast. This here is my bridge, and if you want to cross, you'll have to pay the toll."

"Toll? What do you mean?" I asked nervously. I had brought minimal supplies for my hike and had no gold or jewels to offer. 

The troll smiled slyly. "The toll is a riddle you must solve. Answer correctly and you may pass. Answer wrongly and I will gobble you up!" He rubbed his enormous belly with a chuckled. 

I swallowed hard. Riddles were not my strong suit. But I saw no other wayâ€”I would have to solve the troll's riddle to continue on my journey. 

"Very well," I said, trying to sound braver than I felt. "Ask your riddle, sir troll."

The troll's eyes gleamed. "Here is your riddle:

The more you take, the more you leave behind. 
What am I?"

I frowned, pondering the strange logic of the riddle. Take more, leave more behind? What could that possibly refer to?

The troll grunted impatiently. "I'm waiting for your answer, human. And my belly is ever so empty."   He patted his stomach again with a menacing look.

My mind raced through possibilities as I tried to ignore the troll's threats. Take more, leave more behind. Light? Heat? Time? None seemed quite right. What was the one thing you could keep taking more of that would leave more behind...

"I have the answer," I said, hoping I was right. "The answer to your riddle is footsteps. The more footsteps you take, the more you leave behind."

The troll frowned, scratching his scaly head. "Footsteps, eh? Hmmph, I suppose that's clever enough." He shrugged his massive shoulders. "Very well, you've solved my riddle. You may pass!"

He stepped aside, clearing the way across the bridge. My heart swelling with relief, I hurried across the bridge, thanking the troll politely as I passed. My journey could continue, and I had narrowly escaped becoming the troll's dinner thanks to a clever riddle and a bit of quick thinking. I resolved to pack more gold for any future troll crossings!
