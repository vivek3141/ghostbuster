The alarms were blaring again. The Universal Monitoring System was lighting up like a supernova with warning messages and alerts from across the cosmos. I rubbed my eyes and sighed. This was turning into yet another long day at the office.

Being the architect of the universe is not easy. There are endless details to keep track of, infinite moving parts that have to be precisely calibrated. Even the smallest change could have massive ripple effects. I had to be ever vigilant to make sure all was running smoothly. But today it seemed like everything that could go wrong, was going wrong.

The first crisis of the morning was in the Andromeda galaxy. Two planets in a little-known solar system had suddenly gone rogue and were bumping into each other, wreaking havoc on their orbits. I had to quickly redesign the system to prevent total annihilation. No sooner had I solved that issue than a black hole in the Virgo supercluster started going haywire, ejecting lethal radiation across several light years. I patched it up as fast as I could but feared some distant civilizations may have already been irradiated. My apologies to those affected. 

In the Perseus arm of the Milky Way, a brand new star had gone supernova without warning just as a civilization on a nearby planet was undergoing their equivalent of the Renaissance. Their budding age of scientific discovery was now at risk of being cut short by a devastating stellar explosion. I took emergency action to redirect the most harmful blast waves and radiation away from their world. At least they would survive, though their night skies would never be the same.

By lunchtime I had put out so many fires my mental resources were nearly depleted. But the alerts kept coming without respite. A comet storm in the Whirlpool galaxy required redirection to avoid pummeling a planet rich with life. Just as one storm was dealt with, another would emerge somewhere else like a malevolent game of whack-a-mole. My patience was wearing thin and mistakes were bound to start happening if I didn't rest soon. But rest would have to wait - there simply wasn't time. 

The day dragged on endlessly with no signs of the chaos abating. At some point the alerts became a blur of problems to solve, a gauntlet of disasters to narrowly avoid. All I could do was react and hope to limit the damage. By the time darkness fell in my little corner of the multiverse, I had nothing left. I decided to turn in for the night, knowing tomorrow would likely bring more of the same. The life of the universe architect is one of nonstop peril and crisis. My bad day at work had stretched into what seemed an eternity. The job was as immense as the cosmos itself, and there were never enough hours in the day. But all I could do was forge ahead, tackling each new challenge as it came, and try to keep this endlessly complex contraption we call the universe up and running for another day. My work was never done.
