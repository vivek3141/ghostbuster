The Magic Bag 

I have always had this old canvas bag that seemed to provide what I needed. If I was hungry, I'd find a granola bar. If it was cold, mittens. It was convenient, so I never questioned it.

Recently though, the items have become strange. Last week I pulled out a flashlight just before the power went out. Yesterday, I grabbed a bandage which I ended up needing after cutting my finger. Today I reached in and felt something unfamiliar. I pulled out a small stuffed fox. Puzzling. 

A few hours later I was walking in the park. A little girl was crying. "I lost my fox toy! Have you seen it?" she sobbed. I gave her the fox from my bag. She smiled and hugged it tight. 

How odd these coincidences have become. The bag seems to know what's coming and provides for it, even if the reasons aren't clear yet. I don't understand how it happens, but I'm grateful for it. It's a mystery I've grown to rely on and trust, even if it occasionally leaves me baffled holding a fox toy for a little girl I've never met. I wonder what the bag may have in store for me tomorrow. Whatever it is, I know it's exactly what I'll need.
