The old silver locket gleamed in the dim light of the attic. I gently blew the dust off its tarnished surface and clutched it in my hands. When I had first discovered the strange enchantment that allowed me to bind my soul to an object, I thought it was a gift. A way to escape the mortal coil and achieve a form of immortality. What I didn't foresee were the consequences of such a life unbound from a physical form.  

After the ritual was complete and my soul found its home within the locket, I went about my normal life. The locket remained around my neck at all times, a physical reminder of the anchor that now held my spiritual essence. Then one day, in a careless moment, the chain snapped and the locket tumbled into a storm drain. I frantically tried to recover it but it had washed away into the city sewers. Moments later, my physical body dropped dead as my soul was wrenched into the inky darkness of the sewers under the city streets.

When I next opened my eyes, I found myself in the damp and rancid tunnels, the locket a few feet away covered in muck. I scrambled to grab it, my fingers passing through the filth as if I were a ghost. It was then I realized the gravity of what I had done. My soul was now bound to wander wherever the locket went, and I was at the mercy of fortune's follies. 

Over the decades and centuries, the locket and I have been on a journey of sorts. I've found myself in ancient forests, in caves with bears, at the top of mountains and deep in the bowels of ships. Each time I would have to search to recover the locket and clasp it close, transporting my soul back to a physical body. The time between these jumps could vary - sometimes minutes, often years. I never knew where or when I might blink back into existence. All I knew is that as long as I found the locket, I could not truly die.

Immortality, as it turns out, is often boring and sometimes terrifying. My life is one of constant anticipation of the next random leap into the unknown. Such is the fate I have bound myself to with this little silver trinket. An object of such power and peril, and yet at times as easy to lose as a penny in the gutter. My immortal curse is now and forever will be, to wander the world searching for the place I can call home.
