The massive ship drifted into high orbit around the blue and green world, silent and ominous. The alien captain studied the readings from the surface, its gelatinous body pulsing with interest. There were structures, transportation grids, and electromagnetic emissions that indicated an advanced technological civilization. But their scans had revealed the inhabitants were soft, squishy creatures with no natural means of manipulation. They lacked even the simplest grasping appendages. How had they built an interstellar-capable society without hands?

The captain extended its senses down for a closer look at the aliens, who called themselves “humans.” They were bipedal but their “arms” ended in five feeble digits not capable of precision handling. Even so, the humans had large artificial constructs in low orbit and had recently launched primitive interstellar probes. Their technological progress was puzzling given their limited natural abilities. 

When first contact was established via radio, translation algorithms struggled with concepts that required grasping and manipulation. The humans had developed an abstract symbolic system of communication that surpassed their physical limitations. They also created mechanical and digital means of interaction that amplified their abilities. Robotic extensions and AI systems acted as surrogate hands, doing delicate and complex work. Virtual environments enabled a kind of mental grasp on information.

The captain felt a grudging respect for the creatures below. They had overcome their feeble softness through layers of technological workarounds and a kind of cognitive grasp on the world that extended their reach. Their hands may have been empty, but their minds and machines were dexterous.  

First contact proceeded carefully, with information exchanged via focused radio and laser transmission. Weeks later, a group of human representatives boarded the alien craft, encased in spacesuits with mechanical gloves and tethered lifelines. They floated onto the bridge, grabbing handholds to steady themselves, extending those metal-clad surrogate hands in an awkward but meaningful first gesture of greeting. The aliens pulsed in welcome, sensing the dexterous minds behind the mechanical contraptions. An interstellar empire, it seemed, did not require hands when technology and intelligence could grasp the stars themselves.
