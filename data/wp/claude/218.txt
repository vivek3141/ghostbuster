The old farmhouse creaked as I climbed the stairs to my mother's room. She had been sick for months, the illness slowly ravaging her body. The doctors said there was nothing more they could do. I dreaded the thought of losing her, my only remaining family, but I took solace knowing her suffering would soon end. 

I knocked gently on the wooden door. "Come in," her faint voice answered. I entered and sat by her bedside, taking her frail hand in mine. Her skin was paper-thin, her veins visible underneath. 

"How are you feeling today, mama?" I asked.

She sighed. "The time is near, my dear. But I have one final gift I want to give you."

I squeezed her hand gently. "Anything, mama. What is it?"

With her free hand, she reached under the covers and retrieved a folded, faded piece of paper. "This recipe has been passed down through our family for generations. And now, I'm entrusting it to you."

I unfolded the paper to find my mother's familiar handwriting filling the page. But as I read the ingredients, my heart froze. 

Flour, salt...and a human heart? 

I blinked and read it again, certain my eyes were playing tricks on me. But the words remained unchanged. I looked up at my mother in shock, my mouth agape.

She nodded knowingly. "I know it sounds strange. But there is power in this recipe, my child. Dark power, but power nonetheless."

"Power?" I asked incredulously. "Mama, this calls for a human heart! What exactly have our ancestors been baking?" 

She sighed again, her breath rattling in her chest. "Our family has guarded this secret for centuries. The cookies bestow gifts upon those who eat them, at the cost of the life used to make them. Your great-great-grandmother used this recipe to charm your great-great-grandfather into falling in love with her. And with each generation, the gifts have grown in strength."

My head spun as I tried to process what she was telling me. My family had been practicing witchcraft, dark magic, for ages. And this recipe, my mother's famous cookie recipe, allowed them to work sinister enchantments. 

"I cannot accept this, mama," I said, dropping her hand. "Magic that requires such evil can only be corrupt."

"You are stronger and wiser than I," she whispered. "I see now the error of our ways. Please, promise me the recipe will die with me. Swear to me our family's dark legacy ends today."

I nodded solemnly. "You have my word. The secret will not pass to another generation." 

She smiled, resting back on her pillows. "Thank you, my child. Now I can rest in peace."

She closed her eyes, her breath slowing until finally, her chest stilled. The old farmhouse fell eerily silent.

I folded the recipe and threw it into the fire, watching until the flames devoured every last shred. Our family's sinister tradition would haunt us no more. My mother could now rest easy, knowing the power of that dark magic died with her this day.
