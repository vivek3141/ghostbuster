The blank page stared back at me, as empty as it was yesterday and the day before. I had posted writing prompts on three different websites, hoping for some inspiration or ideas to get the creative juices flowing. Yet still nothing. No responses, no comments, no likes. Just the blinking cursor mocking my writer's block. 

I leaned back in my chair and sighed, tears of frustration starting to pool in my eyes. Why was I even trying? What made me think I could write anything that would resonate with others or spur their creativity? I was just shouting into the void, my prompts drifting unread into the ether.  

The tears began to fall in earnest now, dotting the still-blank page. I crumpled up the paper and threw it, watching as it joined the other wadded up failures littering the floor. Maybe it was time to accept that I just didn't have anything to say. Or maybe, I thought, wiping the tears from my eyes, maybe I needed to write for myself alone. And so I pulled another crisp sheet of paper from the drawer, placed it in front of me, and began to write. No prompts, no expectations, just words that came from within. And the blinking cursor no longer seemed quite so mocking. It waited patiently for me to find my inspiration again.
