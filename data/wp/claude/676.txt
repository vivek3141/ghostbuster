I couldn't believe I was in heaven. Everything was so peaceful and serene. The angels explained that as part of acclimating to the afterlife, I could view moments from my life on earth through photographs that captured my likeness. It was a way to find closure with the life I left behind.

I decided to start at the beginning. Flipping through an album, I found a photo of me as a newborn in my mother's arms at the hospital. My little eyes were just opening for the first time. I felt a rush of gratitude for my mother's unconditional love.  

A few pages later, a photo of my 10th birthday showed a beaming child surrounded by friends. I lingered on that page, warmed by memories of youthful joy and laughter.

As I turned another page, a photo slipped out onto the floor. I picked it up and turned it over, but I was perplexed. It showed a woman who looked exactly like me, but I had no memory of the occasion. In the photo, I was standing in a quaint kitchen with stainless steel appliances, preparing food with a man whose face I couldn't quite make out. 

My heartbeat quickened as questions flooded my mind. Who was this man? And why did I have no recollection of this kitchen or of cooking that particular meal? I examined every detail for clues, but nothing resonated or triggered even a glimmer of recognition.

Just then, an angel walked by. "Excuse me," I said. "There seems to be a mistake. This photo depicts an event I don't remember at all."

The angel peered over my shoulder at the mysterious photo. "I see," she said. "That photo does not depict an actual event from your previous life. It seems one potential future lifetime found its way into your stack by cosmic mistake. We angels organize photos for numerous souls, and in rare instances, possibilities get shuffled incorrectly."

I stared at the photo again with a mixture of wonder, confusion and curiosity about the life that might have been. The angel squeezed my hand and gently took the photo. "No matter," she said. "Focus on the life you lived - and now, the eternal peace you have found."
