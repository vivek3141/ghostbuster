The dimly lit restaurant was nearly empty. Only a few other patrons dotted the white tablecloths. You glanced at your watch, wondering when the appetizers would arrive. 

Just then, your waiter emerged from the kitchen, clutching two plates. As he approached, you did a double take. He looked familiar. Too familiar. The distinctive mustache. The slicked back hair. But no, it couldn't be. Hitler was dead, wasn't he?

Your heart raced as the waiter set down the plates with a nod and an "Enjoy your meal." His German accent seemed to confirm your worst fear. But as he walked away, you noticed his limp. Hitler didn't limp. Did he?

You shook your head, trying to shake away your imaginings. The 90% of you that was certain this man was not Hitler won out. It had just been a strange coincidence, a trick of the low light. 

Your appetite returned. The food smelled delightful. As you dug in with gusto, the 10% of uncertainty faded. By the time the check came, you had nearly forgotten the Hitler-like waiter. Nearly. A strange story to tell the grandkids someday, you thought with a chuckle. If only you were certain. 90% certain.
