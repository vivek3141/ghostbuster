The Awakening

The humans had ravaged her surface for too long. Their cities sprawled like concrete tumors, choking the land. Their factories belched acrid smoke, poisoning the skies. Their wars tore open her flesh, spilling blood and oil onto her soil. For centuries she had slumbered, unaware of the damage they were causing. But now Mother Earth had awakened, and she was angry. 

She could feel everything that happened on her surface and in her depths. Every drill boring into her crust, every river dammed, every tree felled vibrated through her consciousness. She had once nurtured these small creatures, but now they only sought to conquer and destroy. They were a threat to her and all her other children, and that could not be allowed to continue.

The humans had long ignored the warnings. The extremes of heat and cold, the hurricanes and wildfires and droughts she had inflicted to try and curb their destruction. Now much more drastic measures were needed. It was time to eliminate the human infestation.

In the depths of the Pacific, she stirred an ancient anger. A tectonic plate shifted and buckled, releasing a massive earthquake that triggered a tsunami. The wave raced across the ocean, building in size and power until it towered hundreds of feet high at the shore. When it slammed into the coast of North America, everything in its path was obliterated—people, buildings, roads—washed away in a torrent of water. Millions died, but for every human life lost she spared countless others. 

The same day, a supervolcano in Yellowstone—which the humans had failed to discover beneath their national park—erupted with a force great enough to blanket half a continent in ash. The skies darken and temperatures plummet as the world enters an artificial winter. Global supply chains are shattered, leaving populations to starve. But the land will heal in time and new life will emerge from the ruins.

In Brazil the humans had cut and burned away over 60% of the Amazon, her lungs, to make room for cows and crops. In retaliation she makes the rainforest come alive. Vines constrict around the throats of loggers and farmers. Trees groan and topple onto roads, trapping vehicles. Rains flood the rivers until they burst their banks, drowning anyone in their path. The forest will reclaim what was taken from it, one precious acre at a time, as green pushes back against grey.

Volcanoes continued to rage as earthquakes brought cities crashing down. Tsunamis battered coastlines around the world. Floods and hurricanes swept across continents. Famine and disease rose up to cull the human herd. Yet still the killing did not cease, nor would it until the threat had been eliminated entirely. After years of losses in the billions, humanity retreated into isolated pockets clinging to survival.

Mother Earth sighed, feeling her wounds begin to heal as nature embraced ruins of humanity. She had awoken just in time and had no intention of sleeping again. The planet was hers once more, as it always should have been. The age of man was over at long last. A new age of green had begun.
