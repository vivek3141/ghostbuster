The old warehouse loomed over the dock, casting a shadow even in the bright morning light. Mark stood in front of the rusty metal door, hesitating. He didn't want to go in, but he knew he had no choice. 

Mark opened the squeaky door and stepped inside. His eyes adjusted to the dim light filtering through grimy windows. The familiar musty smell hit him as his gaze fell on a figure in the center of the room.

It was his brother, Trey. Bruised, bleeding, bound to a wooden chair. A metal band tightened around his throat, attached by a chain to a mechanism whirring on the floor.

"Trey!" Mark cried out and rushed over. Trey lifted his head slowly, his eyes focusing on Mark.

"You came," Trey said, his voice ragged.

"Of course I came. I'm gonna get you out of here," Mark said, examining the restraints.

"No point," Trey shook his head. "This thing around my neck...the chain gets shorter every few minutes. It's designed so I can't get free before it strangles me. I've only got minutes left."

Mark stared at him in horror. His eyes shifted to the mechanism. It was steadily pulling the chain in, link by link.

"Why didn't you call me sooner?" Mark asked desperately.

"What could you have done? I didn't want you involved. Don't need you dying too," Trey said.

"No...there has to be a way!" Mark said. He grabbed at the mechanism but couldn't disable it. The chain kept slipping through, pulling tighter. 

"Forget it," Trey said. "Just talk to me. I don't want to die alone."

Mark knelt by the chair, grasping his brother's hands. "You're not gonna die. You hear me? I'm gonna get you out of this!" 

"You can't fix everything, Mark." Trey gave a weak smile. "You've always tried to protect me. My big brother."

Mark felt tears stinging his eyes. "I should have been there. I'm so sorry, Trey." 

"Not your fault." Trey's breath was becoming labored as the chain tightened. "Mark...you're the best brother...anyone could ask for..."

"No, don't you dare say goodbye!" Mark shouted. But he could only watch helplessly as the light faded from his brother's eyes and Trey's body went limp in the chair.

Mark stared in stunned disbelief. His fingers drifted to Trey's neck, searching in vain for a pulse. The good die young, his dad always said. But not like this. Mark threw his head back, letting out an anguished cry that echoed through the old warehouse. His brother was gone. And Mark's world would never be the same.
