The New Smart Drug

Detective Jake Stone sighed as he looked at the latest crime scene photos on the board in front of him. It was another robbery from a supposedly impenetrable high-security vault. The criminals were always one step ahead, using advanced technology and what seemed like precognitive abilities to anticipate every move the police would make. 

His partner, Detective Amy Chen, tapped her fingers on the desk. “There has to be an explanation for how they are pulling these off. No crew is that good. They must have some edge we don’t know about.”

Jake frowned. “Every edge we can think of, they already have. What could possibly give them such an advantage?”

Amy shrugged. “I don’t know. Maybe they kidnapped an ex-NASA scientist? Or stole tech from a secret government lab?”

Jake shook his head, discouraged. His eyes fell on a crumpled flyer on the floor. An advertisement for a new smart drug, Promind Plus. “Enhance your cognitive abilities! Think faster, smarter, and more creatively. Unlock your mind’s full potential today!”

A chill went down Jake’s spine. “Amy, look at this.” He passed her the flyer. 

Her eyes widened as she read it. “A drug to enhance intelligence and mental abilities? If criminals had access to something like this...”

“It could explain how they've been running circles around us.” Jake finished her thought. They looked at each other, alarmed at the implications.

“We have to get some of this drug, see what it does.” Amy said. “It may be the only way to understand what we’re up against.”

Jake hesitated. “That's risky. And technically illegal.” But he knew she was right. They were out of options and out of time.

Two days later, a discrete package arrived containing nondescript pills. They each took one, not knowing what to expect. 

After thirty minutes, Jake began noticing subtle changes. His senses seemed sharper, details clearer. Ideas were coming faster than ever, connections sparking in his mind. “Wow, I can see why this would give criminals an edge. I feel...supercharged.”

Amy nodded. "Me too. It's like I can think twenty moves ahead in a chess game. My mind is buzzing." 

A newfound clarity filled Jake's mind. "I have an idea. Let's pull some strings, put rumors on the street that the next target for the thieves should be the New City bank, and set up a carefully planned trap for them using what we know about their methods."

Amy grinned, already several steps ahead of him. "And make sure to anticipate how the drug may allow them to see through a normal trap. We'll have to go a few levels deep in our thinking to truly outmaneuver them."

Jake smiled, feeling the familiar thrill of the chase again. The criminals may have had a head start with this new smart drug, but now the police had caught up. The game was on.
