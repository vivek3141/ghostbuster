The sea was angry that day, my friends. Massive swells rose and fell, crashing against the cliffs of the small island and sending spray high into the air. 

Alone in my small fishing boat, I struggled to steer a course through the turbulent waters. My modest sail flapped uselessly in the high winds. I rowed furiously instead, fighting against the current to make my way back to the harbor.

In the distance, through veils of rain and mist, I glimpsed something strange. A glow emanated from beneath the depths, a pulsing aquamarine light. I shook off the rain collecting on my brow and squinted, trying to determine the source. But just as quickly as it appeared, the glow vanished.

A huge wave rose before me, blocking out the sun and casting my boat in shadow. I clutched the oar handles tightly and said a quick prayer as I braced for impact. But the wave did not crash down. It hung, suspended and unmoving, looming like a crystal cliff.

A loud crack echoed over the sea. The wave shattered into a thousand shards of frozen sea spray. Where the wave had been, a figure now stood atop the water—a man, or at least the shape of one. But no human could be that size. 

My lips parted in awe as I gazed at the massive form, easily 30 feet in height. His lower body was concealed by the churning sea, but his torso, arms and head were distinctly visible. His beard and hair were seaweed, and a crown of coral adorned his brow. 

It was Poseidon, god of the sea. In his hands, he grasped a mighty trident—the source of the glow I had seen. The three prongs were made of some unknown metal and pulsed with energy.

Poseidon peered down at my tiny boat with eyes as gray and stormy as the sea. A stab of fear lanced through my heart. What business could I, a mere mortal fisherman, have with the god of the sea?

His voice boomed like thunder as he spoke my name: “Your tribute has been lacking, mortal. For your insolence, your village shall know my wrath!” 

He raised the glowing trident aloft, and I cried out in terror. I had heard legends of Poseidon wielding storms and tidal waves as weapons. Surely he would destroy my village, dashing homes and lives against the rocks with a sweep of his trident.  

“Please, my lord!” I shouted over the wind. “I meant no insult! We are but poor fishermen, and have little to offer. But whatever meager tribute we can muster, I swear it shall be yours!”

Poseidon paused, his brilliant weapon flashing ominously against the dark clouds. His eyes narrowed as he considered my plea. For a agonizing moment, I feared his rage would not be appeased so easily.

Then he grunted, a low rumble that shook my bones, and lowered the trident. “You have one lunar cycle to bring suitable tribute to my temple. If you fail, mortal, no amount of pleading shall spare your people from my fury!”

The trident flashed again, blinding me. When my vision cleared, Poseidon had vanished. The sea calmed, the clouds parted, and the sun shone through once more.

I sighed in relief and thanked the gods for this chance to make things right. We mortals would have to redouble our efforts and offer rich tributes if we wished to remain in Poseidon's good graces. His wrath, and his trident, were not to be taken lightly. The fate of my people depended on our piety. We would not fail.
