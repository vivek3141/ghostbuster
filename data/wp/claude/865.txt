The old warehouse loomed before me, holding untold secrets behind its rusty metal door. I had to go in.  As I entered the musty interior, dim light filtered through grimy windows. Stacked boxes and dusty equipment filled the space.

Something caught my eye in the back corner. A strange artifact, covered in mysterious symbols. I had to get a closer look!

Just then, a loud CRASH came from the other end of the room as a stack of boxes tumbled over. I froze in place, listening. There it was again, a shuffling sound, coming closer. 

I ducked behind a large crate, hoping to avoid detection. The sounds grew louder until a figure emerged into view. It was a person, but something seemed off about their stilted, shambling gait.

The figure slowly scanned the room, milky white eyes peering out from under a ragged cloak. I held my breath, not daring to move a muscle. After what seemed an eternity, the figure turned and shambled away, disappearing into the shadows.

I let out a sigh of relief. As curiosity again drew me to the artifact, I noticed an old newspaper clipping under a heavy box lid. “Local Woman Goes Missing,” read the headline. My blood ran cold as I realized the figure may not have left after all. 

I scrambled to the exit, artifact forgotten, as a raspy voice echoed through the empty building: "Come out, come out, wherever you are..." I burst through the door into the sunlight and left that place far behind, its secrets best left undisturbed.
