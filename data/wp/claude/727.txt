Left Brain
Calculating, logical, analytical me. I keep things in order and on schedule. I make lists and check them twice. But sometimes I wish I could be more spontaneous, more carefree. I envy her, my Right Brain, for her joy and whimsy. If only I could tap into her creativity. But no, I have a deadline to meet and reports to file. There's no time for creative wandering. I'll stick to my lists and schedules, thank you very much. 

Right Brain
Free-spirited, imaginative me. I love letting my mind wander and ideas flow. A butterfly in the breeze, I float from thought to thought, colorful inspiration to colorful inspiration. But sometimes a bit of order and purpose would be nice. I envy him, my Left Brain, for his focus and discipline. If only I could harness that determination. But no, there are dreams to dream and castles in the clouds to build. Schedules are too constraining. I'll continue my aimless imaginings, thank you very much.

Left Brain 
Another day of deadlines and details. My to-do list runneth over. I try in vain to rein in my Right Brain's distracting fantasies. We have work to do! But she pays me no mind, lost in her creative reveries as usual. If only she would cooperate, together we could achieve so much. But she dances to the beat of her own drummer, that fanciful Right Brain of mine. I'll finish this report on my own, as always. Perhaps someday we'll find a way to work as a team. If only she were a bit less Right Brain...

Right Brain
A whimsical daydream has taken hold, filled with colors and patterns and notions of things to create. I try in vain to get my Left Brain on board for a fanciful adventure. But he has no time for such diversions. Work to do, lists to make! If only he would lighten up, together we could imagine such wondrous things. But he marches to a linear logic all his own. I'll continue crafting my lighthearted fantasies, as always. Perhaps someday we'll learn to play together. If only he were a bit less Left Brain...
