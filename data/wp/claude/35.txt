I gazed out the window of the generation ship at the stars streaking by, a sight I had seen countless times over the millennia of my life. But this journey was different. For the first time, I was trapped.

For thousands of years I had wandered the Earth, watching civilizations rise and fall, technologies progress, and humanity evolve. My immortality was a curse I could not escape, but at least on Earth I had freedom. Now, I was confined to this metal ship for the next 2000 years with the same souls, reborn over endless generations but always familiar. How could I hide what I was for so long?

When the call came out for volunteers to crew one of the first generation ships to colonize a distant planet, I joined out of a sense of obligation to use my knowledge to help humankind. But as the massive ship accelerated away from Earth at a decent fraction of the speed of light, the reality of my situation hit me. I couldn't get off this ride. I was stuck here with these people, reincarnated over and over, as we traveled for millennia. 

How many lifetimes would I see my fellow crew members live? How many children would be born, grow up, grow old and die, while I remained unchanged? I realized with dawning horror that this was a trap I had stumbled into willingly but could not escape. My secret would not remain so for long. 

In those first years, I lived on edge. I feared that at any moment, someone would realize that I was not aging as I should. But as generations passed in what seemed the blink of an eye to me, I started to relax. The ship's population ebbed and flowed, but none seemed to notice in their short lifespans that I remained constant.

By the time we reached our destination, none were left alive who had been there when we set out. I alone disembarked, the sole being who had lived through the entire 2000 year journey, carrying within me memories of all those generations who had traveled the stars to bring humanity to a new world full of promise. My secret was safe, but at the cost of living through the deaths of so many, and being truly alone as no immortal could ever be. My curse and my gift was to shepherd humanity to the stars, even as I withered inside at the relentless march of mortal time that I could never escape.
