The old clock tower chimed midnight. Jake and Amy stared at each other in the dim light of the library, papers and books scattered around them.

"We've still got time," Jake said. "Not enough, but enough." Amy nodded, rubbing her eyes. They had a huge history project due in the morning and had barely started.

They dove back into their research, poring over dusty textbooks and scribbling notes. At 2 am, they started drafting their essay. Amy's head bobbed as she struggled to stay awake. 

"Maybe we take a quick power nap," Jake suggested. Amy agreed - 20 minutes wouldn't hurt. They set an alarm.

Amy's eyes snapped open. Sunlight streamed through the windows. The clock read 7:30.  They scrambled in a panic, grabbing papers and sprinting out the door.

Bursting into class just as the bell rang, out of breath, they handed their essay to the teacher. "We're so sorry - we fell asleep!" Amy said.

The teacher glanced over the essay and smiled. "You covered the topic well. I see you put in a lot of work.  And next time, don't leave your studying to the last night!"  

Jake and Amy sighed in relief. They had pulled it off, with barely enough time. But for their next assignment, they vowed to start early. The clock tower chimed, as if confirming their decision. They still had time, if they used it wisely.
