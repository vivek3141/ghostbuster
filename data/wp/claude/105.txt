The shore of the Styx was crowded with souls awaiting passage, millions upon millions stretching as far as the eye could see. So many lives cut short by the war, now gathered for their final journey across the river to the afterlife. 

As Ferryman of the Styx, it was my duty to transport the dead to the other side. But there was one soul I was tasked with safeguarding until his time came. Adolf Hitler materialized on the bank, stunned at the immense crowds. He glanced around nervously, recognizing so many of the dead as those he had sent to their demise.

The crowds parted upon seeing Hitler, their hatred and anger palpable. Cries of "Murderer!" and "Butcher!" rang out. Some surged forward, hands outstretched, wishing to tear him limb from limb in revenge for the suffering he had wrought. 

I stepped forward, scythe in hand, warning the crowds back. "He will be judged for his crimes, but now he is under my protection. You shall not have your vengeance this day."

Hitler cowered behind me, clutching my robe. "Protect me! They will kill me!"

I turned to him with disgust. "I am bound to deliver you safely to the Judges, but do not mistake my duty for sympathy. You deserve no compassion, no forgiveness for what you have done." 

He wilted under my gaze but I guarded him still as we awaited the Judges. The crowds howled their hatred but did not dare oppose me. 

After what seemed an eternity, the Judges arrived. "We are ready for him now," they intoned. 

I shoved Hitler forward into their waiting arms. "May justice be served." Hitler screamed as they dragged him away. The crowds roared their approval at his fate. My duty was done. I returned to ferrying the dead, so many lives cut short by the evil of one man now facing eternal judgment.
