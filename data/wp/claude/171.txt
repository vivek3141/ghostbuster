The harsh light from Sigma Draconis glinted off the debris floating in space. Captain Jenna Parkes squinted through the viewport of the salvage ship Reykjavik, trying to make sense of the flotsam ahead.

“Slow us to one-quarter sublight,” she ordered. The ship’s engines hummed as they decelerated.  “What the hell happened here?”

“Scanning now, Captain,” said Nils, the ship’s AI. “The debris appears to be the remains of a Modirian cargo freighter. I am detecting scattered parts of the hull, cargo containers, and engine components. However, the ship’s data core is missing.”

“Pirates,” said Jenna grimly. The Modirian transport routes were frequent targets. “Deploy salvage drones to recover anything valuable. And keep scanning for that data core.”

Amid the debris, one object caught Jenna’s eye. It was roughly spherical, about 10 meters in diameter, tumbling slowly end over end. “Magnify the view on that asteroid.” 

Nils zoomed in on the object. Jenna leaned forward, frowning. The surface was too smooth, too regular to be an asteroid. As it rotated into view, she saw a hatch on one end and a propulsion unit on the other. 

“That’s no asteroid. That’s an escape pod!” She felt a surge of excitement.  If anyone had survived and made it to the pod, they might provide clues to what happened.  “Bring it into the landing bay right away.”

A few minutes later, Jenna strode into the bay where the massive escape pod lay. Her crew surrounded it, cutting torches firing to slice through the exterior.  

“Captain, the pod’s in remarkably good shape,” reported Lin, her chief engineer. “It jettisoned cleanly from the freighter, so it should be safe to cut through.”

“Do it quickly. Anyone who made it this far out deserves our help.” Jenna watched as a circular opening was cut, then helped the others pry the chunk of metal away.

Inside was a scene of chaos. Storage containers and emergency supplies were jumbled together with no apparent order. But more alarmingly, splashes of red covered the walls and floor.   

Jenna leapt through the opening and activated her helmet light. The beam fell upon a grim sight: three figures in spacesuits, slumped unnaturally against a wall. Her heart sank. But then, she noticed a faint light flashing on one of the suits. 

“This one’s still alive!” She rushed over and saw the Modirian’s helmet visor was intact. Inside, the woman’s eyes were closed, but Jenna could see her shallow breathing. “Quick, get emergency support in here!”

Her crew raced into action. They carefully extracted the woman from the pod and rushed her to their medbay. The doctor examined her and reported, “She took a nasty blow to the head, but her suit protected her. Some rest in our medical chamber and she should recover fully.”

A few hours later, Jenna sat by the Modirian woman’s bedside as she regained consciousness. “You’re safe now,” Jenna said gently. “I’m Captain Parkes of the Reykjavik.”

The woman blinked. “Where—where am I?” Her eyes widened. “My crew!” 

“I’m very sorry,” Jenna said softly. She explained what had happened.

The woman took a shaky breath. “I’m Vesna. Vesna Markovic. First mate of the Jovian Sun.” She looked at Jenna gratefully. “Thank you for saving my life.”

“Of course,” Jenna replied. “Now, can you tell me what attacked your ship?”

Vesna’s face hardened. “Pirates. Callicaran pirates. We put up a fight, but they overwhelmed us. I managed to launch the pod during the battle but passed out shortly after.” She hesitated. “Did you...recover the data core?”

Jenna shook her head. “I’m afraid it was taken. But don’t worry. We have friends who can help deal with pirate scum like that.” She stood up, determination etched on her face. 

The Callicarans had gone too far this time. It was time to make them pay.
