The Council studied the human carefully. His species had recently achieved interstellar flight, and were petitioning to join the galactic community. But first, they wanted to understand humanity's flaws.

The human spoke: "We are an imperfect species, prone to division and conflict. We form tribes and groups, and often distrust those perceived as 'outsiders.' We can be shortsighted and selfish, slow to understand perspectives other than our own."  

The Council members nodded, familiar with these traits from other species. But the human continued.

"Yet we also have an unmatched capacity for love, creativity, courage, and compassion. We will sacrifice ourselves for the good of others, including those unlike us. We create great works of art, music, and storytelling that speak to the beauty and pain of existence."

"You contain both darkness and light, like all species," the Council leader said. "But how do we know your light will prevail, if we welcome you into the stars?"  

The human smiled. "You don't. But in my short life I've seen humanity make progress, however slow and painful, toward wisdom, empathy and justice. All we need is an open door, and we'll keep walking through it. We'll stumble, but we'll get there, together. Our shared future is one of cooperation and understanding - if only you give us a chance."  

The Council deliberated. Then they made their decision. The human race would join the galactic community, on probation, and learn to walk among the stars. The Council would be watching - but they were optimistic humanity's light would grow brighter. The future was unwritten.
