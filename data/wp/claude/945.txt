The waiting room in the Department of Afterlife Affairs was hot and cramped, filled with broken office chairs and piles of tattered forms. I sighed, shifting uncomfortably on the battered chair they had assigned me 53 years ago when I first arrived.  My spirit guide Bob hovered beside me, consulting the tattered map of the office he had acquired and updated over decades of failed escape attempts.

"The exit is through there, then down the corridor and to the left," Bob whispered. I groaned. The door he indicated led to the Department of Offense Processing, a maze of cubicles and dead ends that we had wandered for 15 years on our last escape try.  

"Look, the shift change is in a few minutes. When all the demons head to the coffee break room, we can slip out. I really think I figured the way out this time," Bob pleaded. I shrugged. We had nowhere else to be for eternity. Might as well humor the old spirit.

An earsplitting bell sounded, signalling the start of the break. Bob dove for the door, gesturing frantically for me to follow. I hauled myself out of the chair and lumbered after him, joints creaking from decades of disuse. 

We emerged into a familiar sea of drab cubicles. Bob weaved purposefully through the maze, darting glances at his map. I trudged behind him, already damp with sweat from the exertion. After an infinity of turns, we arrived at a rusted metal door labeled "Condemned". 

"This wasn't on the last map. I really think this is the way out!" Bob said gleefully. I wrenched at the door, expecting another dead end. With a groan, it swung open. A shaft of natural light dazzled my dim eyes as a rush of fresh air hit my face. Birdsong and the rustle of leaves filled my ears. I blinked at the vibrant colors of a living forest, illuminated by a yellow sun.   

Bob let out a whoop. "We did it! We're free!"

My legs, however, had other plans. Decades of disuse had taken their toll. I stumbled and sagged against the doorframe, joints screaming. I gazed longingly at the verdant woods, so close yet so far. 

Bob's face fell. "No..no no no! We were so close!" He fluttered in circles, a picture of panic. 

I swallowed hard, forcing out words that tore my soul. "It's okay, Bob. You got us out. Now you go - fly free. Live the escape we always dreamed of."

Bob floated over to me, dejection etched into every line of his ethereal form. "I won't leave you behind. We're in this together, friend." 

I smiled sadly at the faithful spirit. Together forever in a hell born of too much paperwork and not enough common sense - there were worse fates, with worse companions. My legs gave out, sending me sprawling back into the dank corridor. The rusted door slammed shut behind me with an air of finality, once more sealing us in bureaucratic hell. But at least I had Bob.
