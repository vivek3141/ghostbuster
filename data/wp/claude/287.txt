The Year is 2200. You arrive home to find your best friend and girlfriend forming a hivemind.  

I walked through the front door of my apartment, exhausted after a long day at the solar plant. All I wanted to was grab a nutrient pack, take a hot shower, and relax in my hoverchair while catching up on the latest VR streams. 

But when I entered, something felt off. The lights were dimmed and I heard strange whispering sounds coming from the living room. I walked in to find my best friend Mark and my girlfriend Jenny sitting cross-legged on the floor across from each other, their foreheads pressed together and eyes closed. Their neural interface bands were active, blinking as their brain waves synced.

My heart dropped as I realized what was happening. They were forming a hivemind.

“What the hell are you doing?!” I shouted. 

Their eyes popped open, for a moment still glazed over as they transitioned out of the connection. Then they focused on me, startled and disoriented.  

“We were just experimenting,” Jenny said. “Playing around with some of the new neural tech they’re developing at my job.”

“Without telling me?” I said, rage building in my chest. “How could you do this behind my back?”

“We knew you wouldn’t understand, man,” Mark said. “You’re always so suspicious of new technology. But it’s truly amazing—we were able to share thoughts, memories, everything so deeply at a speed and level of intimacy you can’t achieve through normal conversation.” 

“This isn’t some new game you can play around with,” I said. “Hiveminds are dangerous and illegal for good reason. Do you have any idea of the damage this could do to your consciousness? The autonomy you gave up?” 

“Don’t be so dramatic,” Jenny said. “It was perfectly safe. The bands have security measures to prevent any unwanted mental crossover or manipulation.”

“And what about me?” I asked. “Did I factor anywhere into this decision to radically alter and share what makes you, you?”  

“We didn’t think you needed to be involved,” Mark said. “This was about Jenny and me.”

I just stared at them in disbelief. How could two of the people I cared about most betray me this way? My girlfriend and best friend were drifting away, and I feared what other reckless experiments with their minds and relationship this could lead to if I didn't put a stop to it now. 

"I can't do this right now," I said, holding up my hands and backing away.  "You went too far. I need time." 

I turned and walked out of the apartment, my vision blurring as the door slid closed behind me. The future was here, but I wished it hadn't arrived so quickly. My best friend and girlfriend had chosen to leave me behind. The year was 2200, but I had never felt more alone.
