The Dusty Rejects

I was always the leftover, the toy no child wanted. A generic green army man without any distinguishing features. When the new shipment of toys would arrive at the department store, I was always left behind on the shelves while the flashier, newer toys were bought and played with. 

After many years of being passed over season after season, I eventually tumbled behind one of the shelves, joining the rest of the forgotten toys. There were action figures missing limbs, dolls with torn dresses, building blocks chewed by mice. We were the unloved, covered in years of dust and grime.

At first, I kept hoping a child might come by and pick me from the shelf, giving me a chance at play. But over time, I accepted my fate as a forgotten toy. The others warned me not to wish for owners that would never come. It only led to disappointment.

We found ways to pass the time, re-enacting epic battles, putting on little plays, arguing over the true definition of toy. Some days the hours dragged on, others slipped by fast. We grew accustomed to the darkness and close quarters. This was our lot in life as unwanted toys.

Everything changed the day a gleaming new toy car zoomed behind the shelves. He still smelled of fresh plastic and factory paint, his slick wheels gliding over the rough wood of the shelves. We gathered around in amazement at this shiny newcomer. 

He told us of toy stores filled with light and children that gazed at him with longing. Of owners who would name him and zoom him around, filling his days with thrills and adventure. His stories were hard to believe, this magical world of wanted toys.

A few days later, the car was gone, purchased by an excited child. The rest of us remained where we always were, covered in the familiar blanket of dust. But now there were rumors of that fabled toy paradise, a world we would never know. We were the forgotten, the toys left behind. Our place was here, in the shadows of the shelves. This was where we belonged.
