The red sands swirled outside the domed city of New Dallas. Inside, Mara gathered her forces in the central square. One hundred years ago, her ancestors came to Mars as colonists from Earth. Now tens of thousands of native Martians lived and worked in domed cities across the planet, governed by an increasingly oppressive Earth regime. 

Mara was born on Mars and had only been to Earth once, as a child. She didn't feel any connection to the dusty blue sphere in the sky. Her people were Martians, pioneers who had tamed a harsh world and made a new home. Yet Earth's directives controlled every aspect of Martian life, from how many children each family was permitted to have to how much food could be grown and even what history was taught to Martian children. Earth saw Mars as a colony to be exploited, not a partner.

Mara's followers chanted "Free Mars!" as she took the stage. Her heart swelled at the sight of so many Martians standing together. "For one hundred years, Mars has served Earth obediently!" she cried. "We have enriched Earth with our labor and resources. But now is the time for independence!" 

The crowd cheered, a roar that shook the dome. Mara held up her hands. "As of today, there will be no more shipments of food, fuel or resources bound for Earth until we have been granted complete autonomy and self-governance!" 

There could be consequences, Mara knew, but she also knew this was the only path forward for Mars if there was ever to be justice. She activated her communications device to radio the governor and deliver her demands. The words that came surprised even her in their strength:

"Mars is closed for business until it is open for freedom! Governor, Mars declares her independence. Today, we establish the Republic of Mars!"

The crowd erupted again. Mars would be free.
