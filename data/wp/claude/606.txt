The thick ropes chafed my wrists as I struggled in vain against my bindings. The dim light of the sacrificial chamber flickered across the ominous stone altar before me, ancient carvings of arcane symbols etched into its surface. 

A dozen robed figures chanted in a circle around me, their hoods obscuring their faces. The leader stepped forward, raising a wickedly curved dagger above his head.

"Great God of the Harvest, accept this sacrifice of blood and bone! We offer you this man's life so that you may bless us with plenty!"

I sighed. This was becoming tiresome. Did they not recognize me? Had I not walked among them for the past season, observing their village and learning their ways? Had I not guided the hands of the healers and helped their crops grow tall and strong? 

The dagger began to plunge downwards. Enough of this nonsense.

With a burst of power, I shredded the ropes binding my limbs. The dagger clattered to the ground as the leader stumbled back in shock. All around the circle, the robed figures gasped.

I stood up from the altar, gazing at each of them in turn. "Have you learned nothing?" I asked, my voice booming through the chamber. Their god was standing before them, veiled in mortal form. 

They fell to their knees, bowing their heads. "Forgive us, oh Great One," the leader cried. "We did not know it was you."

"The time for secrecy is over," I proclaimed. "From this day forth, I shall walk openly among you as your protector and guide. You need offer no more blood or bone to gain my favor. I ask only for your faith, and your wisdom."

They bowed lower, groveling. "It shall be as you say. We pledge our faith and our service to you, Great God, now and forevermore."

I nodded, satisfied that the message had sunk in at last. No more would these foolish sacrifices be performed. I had work ahead of me, guiding this village into a brighter future. But for now, celebration was in order.

"Rejoice, my people," I said with a smile. "Your god walks among you." A great cheer arose from the crowd. The age of sacrifice was over. The age of enlightenment had begun.
