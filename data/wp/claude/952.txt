Anakin strode into the Jedi Temple, his lightsaber gleaming by his side. His mind was swirling with emotion as he prepared to do what must be done. The Jedi had betrayed the Republic. They had betrayed him. Now they would pay the price.

He walked into one of the training rooms, where a group of young Padawans were practicing their lightsaber technique under the watchful eye of their instructor. The students ranged from ages 10 to 14, their faces filled with determination and focus as they went through the beginner kata. 

Upon seeing Anakin enter, their instructor bowed. "Master Skywalker, what a pleasant surprise! Would you like to review and provide guidance to our students?"

Anakin ignited his lightsaber. "There will be no more students after today."

The instructor's eyes went wide with shock. He grabbed his own lightsaber and stood between Anakin and the students. "Anakin, what are you doing?"

Anakin lunged forward, striking the instructor down with a quick slash. The man fell to the floor, dead.

The students screamed. They huddled together, staring at Anakin with a mixture of terror and confusion. 

Anakin raised his lightsaber, preparing to charge at the defenseless younglings. This was for the good of the new Empire, he told himself. The Jedi ways must end. No mercy could be shown.

But as he stepped forward, something gave him pause. Memories flashed through his mind - memories of himself as a young boy, first arriving at the Temple, full of fear and uncertainty. How all the older Padawans and instructors had been kind to him. Guided him. Made him feel at home.

He shook his head, trying to clear the thoughts away. But they clung stubbornly to his mind. These were not merely younglings - they were children. As he had once been.

One of the students, a Togruta girl of about 12, stepped forward. Her head was bowed respectfully, but her voice did not waver. "Master Skywalker, please do not do this. We mean you no harm. We are defenseless. Have mercy."

Her words echoed in his mind, over and over. Have mercy. Have mercy.

He realized with dawning horror what he had come here to do. He had come to slaughter innocent children in cold blood. This was not justice. This was not what he wanted. 

His lightsaber tumbled from his fingers, falling to the floor with a clatter.

The girl approached him slowly. "Thank you for not killing us, Master Skywalker. We know there is still good in you."

Anakin sank to his knees, emotion overcoming him at last. The students gathered around, forgiving and consoling. He knew in that moment he could never be a part of Palpatine's new order. The Jedi had not betrayed him after all. He had betrayed himself. But there was still a chance to make things right.

As long as the next generation remained, hope remained. And Anakin would fight to save them from sharing his dark fate. The end.
