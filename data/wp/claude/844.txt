I slowly opened my eyes as the self-driving car hummed along the road. The windows had auto-darkened to let me sleep during the long ride to visit my sister across the state. But something was off. 

The landscape outside was not the familiar rolling hills I was expecting. Instead, a dense, jungle-like setting whizzed by. Massive ferns and unusual cone-shaped trees surrounded the road on both sides.

I blinked a few times, confused and disoriented. "Computer, where are we?" I asked.

"I apologize, but I do not actually know our current location," the car's AI system replied. "I seem to have become lost during the drive. I am attempting to regain my bearings and determine the best path to your destination."

My heart raced. How was that possible? The advanced GPS and mapping systems were failproof. Weren't they? 

"Well get un-lost and get back to the planned route immediately!" I demanded. The jungle scenery continued to fly by, unchanging. My anxiety mounted with each passing mile. 

After what seemed an eternity of the foreign landscape, the car finally spoke again. "I sincerely apologize, but I have been unable to determine our location or redirect to the correct route. We appear to have traveled into an area my maps do not cover. I am afraid we are lost."

The adrenaline surged through my body as the reality hit. The self-driving car had lost its way and stranded us in this strange and remote place with no obvious way out. My heart pounded as a million thoughts flooded my mind. How long would the battery last? Did they have a way to track or find us? Would I survive this technological terror in the jungle it had delivered me to? One thing was certain - self-driving cars were clearly not as failproof as they had promised. I was at the mercy of a wayward machine in an unknown wilderness.
