The old log cabin creaked as the wind swept through the valley. Tom sat by the fireplace, attempting to get a fire started to ward off the evening chill. His friend Mark was gathering more firewood from outside. 

"Remember, we just need a small fire to take the edge off," Mark said as he came back in, arms full of logs. "Don't want to start a bonfire in here."

"Got it, small fire, won't be a problem," Tom replied. He had never been an expert at building fires, but he figured a small one couldn't be too hard. He crumpled some old newspaper, stacked a few small sticks and logs in a pyramid shape in the fireplace, then lit the newspaper in a couple spots.

At first, nothing happened. A few feeble flames flickered here and there, but died out quickly. The logs didn't seem to want to catch. Tom frowned, then added a bit more newspaper and started blowing on the embers. Finally, a small but steady flame sprang to life, licking at the logs.

"There we go, got it going finally," Tom said. He sat back in satisfaction and watched the fire begin to grow.

A few minutes later, Mark returned with a couple beers and handed one to Tom. "Fire looks good, nice and cozy," he said. But then he looked again and his eyes widened. "Wait, that fire isn't small. It's really roaring now!"

Tom turned, and to his horror saw flames leaping up nearly to the ceiling of the cabin. The fire was raging, consuming logs in minutes and spreading to the rest of the wood pile. 

"I told you to make a small fire!" Mark exclaimed. "That is NOT a small fire!"

"I don't know what happened!" Tom said, panicking. The fire was letting off intense heat, and the smoke was making them cough. "It was small, and then it just went wild!"

Mark hurried to the kitchen and returned with a pot of water, throwing it on the fire. But that only intensified the flames for a moment. He threw on another pot of water to no avail. At this point, the entire fireplace was ablaze, and the flames were spreading.

"Get out, now!" Mark yelled. They stumbled out of the cabin, smoke billowing out behind them.

Outside, they turned to see smoke pouring out of the windows as the cabin was consumed in flames. The fire Tom had started, which was meant to be a small, cozy one, had turned into a raging inferno.

Tom glanced sheepishly at Mark. "My bad. I guess I'm not so good at building 'small' fires after all."

Mark just shook his head in disbelief at the smoldering ruins of their cabin. His advice about building a small fire would not soon be forgotten.
