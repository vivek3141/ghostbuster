The Gift and the Curse 

Jenny had always been able to sense the emotions of others through touch. A handshake, a hug, even a light brushing of shoulders as she walked down the street—they all revealed flashes of feelings, like snippets of a movie playing in her mind. 

Most of the time, it was dull background noise. The humdrum melancholy of a stranger in a crowd, the nervous excitement of two teenagers on a first date, the contentment of an old married couple sitting on a park bench. Jenny had learned to tune most of it out, but she couldn’t turn off her gift completely. It was always there, for better or worse.

The first time she shook hands with Mark, the new mailman, she was flooded with his positivity and kindness. As their hands clasped, she felt his genuine warmth and goodwill wash over her like a wave. She saw images of him whistling while he sorted letters, pets following him down the sidewalk on his route, neighbors waving cheerfully when they saw him. 

Jenny smiled at Mark as she took her mail. “It’s wonderful to meet you!” she said. And she meant it. In that moment, she knew this was a person who brought light and joy to the world. She felt lucky to have met someone so purely good-natured.  

Over the following months, Jenny found excuses to chat with Mark on his rounds, always greeting him with a smile and enthusiastic hello. His positivity never seemed to fade. She told her friends she didn’t think it was possible for someone to be so consistently upbeat and kindhearted all the time. He was almost too good to be true.

Then one autumn day, as Jenny was raking leaves in her front yard, Mark came ambling down the street on his deliveries. When he waved at her, she suddenly noticed his smile didn’t seem to reach his eyes. She walked over to take her mail from him, and as their hands touched, she gasped.

His emotions flooded into her as a storm of anguish and despair. Underneath the cheerful mask, Mark was suffering a deep sadness she couldn’t comprehend. She saw flashes of scenes unfamiliar to her—a hospital room, a funeral, an empty house echoing with loneliness.  She stumbled back, stunned by the raw pain of the visions.

Mark’s smile disappeared in an instant. “Are you OK?” he asked, concerned. He reached out to steady her, then pulled his hand back in confusion.

Jenny looked at him with a mixture of shock and pity. “I—I didn’t know,” she said softly. “You're always so happy. I had no idea you were hiding such deep pain.”

Mark paled. “What are you talking about?”

She hesitated, unsure of how much to reveal. But she wanted him to know she understood. “I have this ability to sense people’s emotions and glimpses of their lives just from touch,” she explained. “When we shook hands just now, I saw and felt terrible darkness in you, hidden beneath your cheerfulness. A tragedy that still haunts you.”

His eyes widened. For a long moment, he said nothing. She could see him wrestling with whether or not to confide in her. Finally, his shoulders sagged, and the truth spilled out—how his wife had died after a long illness the year before and his house now felt empty and lifeless without her. How some days he didn’t think he could keep putting on a happy face, but he knew spreading a little joy and kindness made his own burden feel lighter, if only for a while. 

Jenny listened with a compassion that surprised him. When he finished, she said, “I’m so sorry. I had no idea.” 

Mark shook his head ruefully. “I’ve gotten good at hiding it. But I should have known I couldn’t fool someone with your gift.”

“Please, don’t hide from me anymore,” Jenny said. “Let me be there for you, the way you are for all of us.” 

And so a deep friendship was forged, as Mark opened his heart to someone who glimpsed the secret depths of it. Jenny was glad, more than ever, for her gift—and her curse—that allowed her to see when a smile didn't tell the whole story. What at first seemed too good to be true turned out to be far richer and more complex. She was honored to know the man behind the joy he brought to the world.
