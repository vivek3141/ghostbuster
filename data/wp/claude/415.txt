The old mirror had been in Jenny's attic for as long as she could remember. It was large and ornate, with an intricately carved wooden frame. As a child, she had gazed into its silvery surface, staring at her reflection. 

One day, as Jenny was rummaging around the attic looking for some old photos, she noticed something strange in the mirror. At first she thought it was a trick of the light, but when she moved her hand, the reflection didn't move. Puzzled, she leaned in close to get a better look. Her reflection gazed back at her, but something was off. The woman in the mirror looked subtly different, with piercing blue eyes instead of Jenny's hazel ones.

Jenny startled back in shock. Her heart raced as she tentatively reached out again towards the mirror. This time, her reflection remained still. Tentatively, she touched the surface of the mirror. Ripples spread from her fingertips, as if she had touched the surface of a pond. She gasped—the glass felt like liquid under her touch. 

Heart pounding, Jenny steeled her nerves and slowly reached into the mirror. Her hand passed through the glass as if it was not there. She gasped as she felt another hand grasp hers—the hand of her mirror self. 

Jenny's mirror self stepped through the mirror. They stood face to face, two versions of the same person from parallel worlds.  "I've been waiting for you for a long time," her mirror self said with a smile. 

Jenny's mind reeled. All these years, mirrors had been portals to another dimension. Her mirror self explained that their worlds were almost identical, with only a few key differences. By passing through the portal, they had opened the doorway between dimensions.

"There is so much we can learn from each other," said the mirror Jenny, still grasping her hand. Jenny smiled in wonder as she realized this was the beginning of an incredible adventure. Her whole life had been leading to this moment, to this first contact between dimensions. The possibilities were endless.
