The old fisherman hummed an tune as he rowed his boat down the winding river. The sun was shining, the birds were singing, and he was sure to catch a big one today.  

As he rowed past a rocky cliff, he noticed some strange words etched into the stone: "Abandon hope, all ye who enter here."

That's odd, he thought. He had lived by this river his whole life and never seen that before. He shrugged and continued on.

A few bends later, the river opened up into a gloomy cavern. No sunlight entered here. The water turned as black as night. An involuntary shiver went down the fisherman's spine.

His little wooden boat drifted into the inky waters. All was silent except for the occasional drip of water echoing in the distance.

Suddenly, ghostly shapes began emerging from the dark waters around him. Skeletal hands grasped the rim of his boat. Bodies hauled themselves up, tattered grave clothes hanging off their bony frames.

The fisherman froze in terror. He opened his mouth to scream but no sound came out.

One of the ghosts turned to gaze at him with hollowed eyes. "You have entered the River Styx, old man. There is no way out but through."

The fisherman's heart seized in his chest. The River Styxâ€”the mythical portal to the underworld. He had passed into the land of the dead while still living.

The ghosts dragged their bodies into his boat, their spectral forms passing through his own mortal flesh like a chill wind. He gasped for air, his lungs refusing to work properly.

As his boat navigated the black river, skeletal passengers strewn about, the fisherman wept in fear and sorrow. His beloved river, the river of life, had become the river of death - never again to be crossed by the living. The River Styx had claimed him as its own. His journey was over.

The End.
