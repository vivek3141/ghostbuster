I was tidying up around the house, doing some mundane chores on a lazy Sunday afternoon. As I walked past the mirror in the hallway, a flash of movement caught my eye. I glanced at the mirror and froze in my tracks. 

There, standing behind me in the reflection, was my sister Jenny. But that was impossible. Jenny had passed away three years ago in a car accident. Yet there she was, smiling at me from inside the mirror.

My heart pounded as I slowly turned around. But there was no one there. I looked back at the mirror, and Jenny was still smiling at me, looking just as I remembered her. 

I stumbled forward and reached out to the mirror, thinking I must be hallucinating. But as my fingers touched the cold glass, they seemed to pass right through. For a brief moment, I felt the warmth of Jenny's fingers intertwining with my own. A feeling of peace and joy washed over me, like I had been reunited with a missing part of my soul.

But then the moment passed. My hand was against the solid mirror glass again. And when I looked up, Jenny was gone.

I don't know if what I saw was real, or just a figment of my imagination. Perhaps I had dozed off while cleaning and dreamed the entire encounter. All I know is that in that moment, I felt closer to Jenny than I had in years. The pain of losing her, usually a dull ache I carried with me each day, seemed lighter somehow. The mirror had given me a gift - a chance to see her again, even if just for a second. A chance to let her know through the veil of whatever separates us now that she is always in my thoughts, and always in my heart.

The house seemed warmer as I finished my chores. And that night as I drifted off to sleep, I smiled again at the memory of Jenny smiling back at me in the mirror, her fingers woven between my own.
