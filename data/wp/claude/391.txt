The Truth Teller 

I am concise and to the point. I do not believe in flowery language or unnecessary embellishments. My name is Brevity and I am a writer that values clarity and efficiency.

Each word I choose has a purpose. I do not use ten words when five will do. My sentences are streamlined, devoid of frivolous phrases or pointless asides. I keep my prose trimmed and taut, exercised of excess fat.

Some call my style cold or lacking personality. I argue the opposite. My personality shines through in the crispness of my communication and the potency of my message. I do not hide behind lavish language or dazzle with verbosity. I have an economy of style that I am proud to embody.

My paragraphs follow a strict regimen of relevancy. Each sentence builds upon the next in a coherent flow towards a singular goal. You will find no tangled thickets of irrelevance in my work, no meandering streams of consciousness. I construct my compositions with clarity and reason, mapping each step with care before I set out.  

I have been called ruthless in my editing, merciless with my delete key. I cut and cut again until only the essence remains. Some writers bleed for their work, leave shards of themselves scattered across the page. Not I. I do not become emotionally attached to any turn of phrase or pretty string of words. If it does not serve the central purpose, out it must go. 

You may think my style too sparse, too pragmatic to be creative. But do not mistake a neat and trim garden for one lacking in life. Within my precise and economical prose, creativity and meaning still bloom. They simply do so in a more orderly fashion.

I am Brevity, a writer with a focused mind and streamlined style. I seek to illuminate and inform with the least amount of fuss. For a story told in 300 words as requested, I hope I have done just that! My name is Brevity and I value clarity, concision and truth.
