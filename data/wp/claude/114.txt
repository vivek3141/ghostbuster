Timmy lay in bed, covers pulled up to his chin, staring at the closet. The doors were slightly ajar, and inside was only darkness. But he knew the monster was in there, lurking, waiting for the light to turn off so it could come out. 

His gaze shifted to under the bed. There was another monster under there. He had never seen it fully, but he caught glimpses of scaly skin and sharp claws. At night he could hear it stirring, scraping against the wooden bed frame.

Timmy had a reckless idea. He leaned over the edge of the bed, dangling his head upside down to peer into the gloom.

"Psst, Mr. Under The Bed Monster, are you there?" he whispered.

There was a pause, then a gravelly voice responded, "What do you want, little morsel?"

Timmy swallowed hard. "I have a deal for you. I'll give you free reign to grab my feet or ankles or whatever when I get out of bed. On one condition."

The monster growled, a low rumble that shook the bed. "I do not make 'deals' with humans. I take what I wish."

"But there's another monster in my closet!" Timmy said quickly. "What if I told you you could have that monster too? Two snacks are better than one, right?"

There was a contemplative silence. Then the monster spoke again. "What do you propose?" it asked suspiciously.  

Timmy could hardly believe his plan was working. "Attack the closet monster tonight when I turn off the light. Defeat it. Then you can have the closet to yourself, and eat both me and the other monster. I just want the other one gone."

The bed shook again with the monster's laughter. "You drive a hard bargain for one so small. But I accept your deal!"

When Timmy's mother came to turn off the light, Timmy's heart was pounding. In the darkness, he heard shrieks and growls and roars. The sounds of a ferocious battle filled the room. He pulled the covers over his head, hoping he wouldn't get grabbed in the confusion.

After a few minutes, silence fell. Timmy hesitated, then peeked out from under the covers. His closet doors were open wide. The monster from under the bed poked its scaly head out.  "The closet is mine now, little morsel. Our deal is done. But do not worry, I shall not forget our bargain!"

Timmy gulped as the monster descended back under the bed. He had gotten rid of one monster, but now had unleashed the other. And he had the feeling this was going to come back to bite him. But for now, at least the closet was safe again. Timmy shut his eyes and went to sleep, trying not to dangle any limbs over the edge of the bed.
