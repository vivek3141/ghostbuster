I couldn't believe it. The hero, the bane of our kind, slayer of goblins without count, lay dead at my feet. His enchanted blade that had taken so many of us was now stained with his own blood. 

How did I, a small and weak goblin barely able to hold a sword, defeat this mighty warrior? Pure luck and chance, nothing more. I had been foraging for mushrooms in the forest, as was my job. I heard the stomping of his feet and hid, fearing the flashing of his terrible sword.

But his foot slipped on the wet leaves, and he tumbled down a rocky slope. I heard the crack of bones. At the bottom lay the hero, his body broken. His sword had tumbled from his hands.

I crept down, scarce believing my eyes. Yet there he lay. In that moment, I knew fate had given us goblins a chance. I lifted the enchanted blade and with a single thrust pierced the heart of the goblin's bane. 

The forest was eerily silent. Then a cheer rose, distant but loud, as the word spread. The hero had fallen. The goblins were free. My name is now exalted, the goblin who defeated the hero, who triumphed where an army had failed. Fortune favors the small, I see now. The mighty can slip and fall. And a humble goblin may change the fate of all.
