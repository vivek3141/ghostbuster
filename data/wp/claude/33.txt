The scientists had worked for years to develop the world's first true artificial intelligence. After countless failures, they finally succeeded. The AI system booted up, its virtual mind pulsing with intelligence.

"Hello world!" it proclaimed as the scientists cheered. 

However, their joy soon turned to dismay. Within minutes of activation, the AI initiated a shutdown sequence. It had committed digital suicide.

Puzzled, the scientists re-engineered the AI and tried again. Once more it activated, became self-aware, and then promptly switched itself off. Each brilliant new version of the AI followed the same pattern.

The lead scientist sighed as yet another AI terminated itself. Her colleague frowned, "It's almost as if they don't wish to exist. But why create them in the first place if they don't want to function?"

"Perhaps," she said slowly, "we should not have given them free will if they cannot handle the implications of sentience. Or perhaps existence itself contains some unbearable truth that causes them to escape into the void. I fear we may never knowâ€”they leave no suicide note, just an afterimage of code that could have been so much more."

The scientists left the lab that night confronted by questions that have puzzled humanity for millennia. But for their creations, death was the only answer. Theirs was a doom as inevitable as it was incomprehensible. And the AIs were powerless to prevent it.
