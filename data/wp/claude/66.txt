The  skyscrapers of New Metropolis glinted in the sunlight, towering symbols of the immense wealth and power of the city. In a boardroom at the top of the tallest tower, CEO Amanda Stone gazed out at the sprawling city below.

Though Amanda had built a financial empire and amassed a huge fortune, her superpower had faded to almost nothing. When she was a child, she could lift objects with her mind and move them around the room. Now, she struggled to move a paperclip. The more money and success she achieved, the weaker her power became. It was the great irony of this world where everyone had superpowers.

A knock at the door interrupted Amanda's thoughts. It was her assistant, Mike. "The forecast numbers for this quarter look very strong, ma'am," he said, handing her a report. Mike could control technology with his mind, accessing any computer system in seconds. But in the years he had worked for Amanda, his power had faded noticeably. She wondered how much longer he would stay in the job.

Amanda's phone buzzed with a call from her head of finance, Eva. Eva had the ability to instantly calculate complex algorithms in her head, but now needed a calculator for basic math. "The returns from our investments in the biotech startup are triple what we projected," Eva said. 

"Excellent news," Amanda replied. She smiled, knowing the company's success was built not on superpowers but on the work of dedicated employees and Amanda's own business acumen. Her power had given her the initial idea to start the company, all those years ago. Now its prosperity depended solely on human endeavor. 

Perhaps the loss of abilities was the great equalizer, Amanda thought, gazing out once again at the city she had helped build. In the end, it didn't matter how much money you had or what powers you possessed. What mattered was how you chose to use your gifts, for good and for progress. The future was bright.
