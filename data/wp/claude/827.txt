I wiped the sweat off my brow and admired my creation. After years of work, it was finally complete—a working time machine. Well, mostly working. It had one limitation: it could only transport the people and objects inside the machine itself. Nothing could be sent to or retrieved from other times. But it was still an incredible achievement, allowing people to witness history firsthand by traveling to the past. 

As I sat there, considering potential test runs, there was a knock at the door of my workshop. I opened it to find two strangers, a man and woman, dressed in unusual clothes. "Are you the inventor of the time machine?" asked the man. I nodded hesitantly. To my surprise, they pushed past me into the workshop.

"It works!" exclaimed the woman. "We are from the year 2135. We have come as the first visitors from the future."

My mind reeled. Visitors from over two centuries into the future! This was both exciting and unnerving. "How did you find me?" I asked.

The man explained, "Historical records indicated a man matching your description completed the first working time machine in this year. We have been monitoring the spacetime continuum for perturbations indicating its first use. As soon as we detected one, we realized now was our only chance to go back this far, before the timeline is altered too much." 

"Fascinating," I murmured. My mind filled with questions about the future. "What is the world like in your time? What scientific and technological advances have been made?"

The woman smiled. "I'm afraid we cannot tell you many details about the future, as that could potentially alter the sequence of events leading to our present. In our time, time travel is strictly regulated and used for research purposes only to prevent such paradoxes and changes to established history."

I was disappointed but understood their reasoning. "Then why travel back at all?" I asked. 

"Curiosity," said the man. "The chance to see how it all began—to meet the inventor of the first time machine himself."

My heart swelled at the thought of my work enduring and being appreciated for generations to come. I invited my unusual guests to sit and we talked for hours, exchanging stories of our lives and times while being careful not to reveal too much about the future. When at last they prepared to return to their present, I felt a mix of wonder and sadness. I shook their hands warmly. 

"Thank you for your visit," I said. "You have given me a extraordinary gift—hope for the future and affirmation that all my work has been worthwhile. I shall remember this day for the rest of my life." They bid me a fond farewell, then stepped inside the time machine and vanished into the future, leaving me with memories I would always treasure.
