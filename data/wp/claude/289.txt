The twin suns of Zepton VII shone down on the capital city of Xylax. Ambassador Zlorb glided into the transmission chamber, his eyestalks waving with excitement. After years of preparation, today was the day. 

Zlorb straightened his ceremonial sash and faced the quantum entanglement communicator. With a deep breath, he began transmitting the first official greeting from his species to the humans of Earth.

"People of Earth, we come in peace. We are an advanced race from the Zeptun system, and we wish to open diplomatic relations with your planet. We have observed your transmissions and believe our two civilizations could have much to offer each other through cooperation and cultural exchange. We await your response. May peace reign between our worlds."

Zlorb bowed his eyestalks, proud to have represented his world so well. His assistant chittered with glee at this historic moment.

Days passed with no response. Anxiety mounted. Finally, the communicator crackled to life. An incoming transmission! 

Zlorb eagerly activated the viewscreen, ready to receive the human leader's reply. But instead of a wise statesman, the screen depicted a human male in a state of undress, holding its genitalia. A vulgar symbol flashed again and again.

Zlorb recoiled in horror. His assistant ran from the room, shrieking. 

This was their first contact with the humans? A depraved display of reproductive organs? Zlorb felt queasy. He had no idea how to respond.

Just then, a new message arrived in the Galactic Common tongue:

"People of Zepton VII, please forgive the unseemly first transmission. That was a prank by an irresponsible individual. We gladly accept your offer of friendship and look forward to learning from one another."

Zlorb's nausea faded, replaced by a flood of relief. There was still hope. The humans seemed willing to move past this distasteful first impression. 

He composed a reply and sent it swiftly, before any other surprises could arrive:

"Humans of Earth, we appreciate your clarification. We believe our communications may have gotten off on the wrong appendage. Let us start anew. We come in peace and friendship."

With that, intergalactic relations were established at last. But Zlorb knew that first image would haunt his nightmares for years to come. Their message of peace was not the first to reach the humans, but with patience and understanding, it might yet be the most lasting.
