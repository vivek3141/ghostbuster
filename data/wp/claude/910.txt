God sighed and leaned back into his lounge chair made of clouds. It had been an eternity of listening to prayers, granting miracles, and generally keeping the Universe running smoothly. He felt stressed and burdened by the demands of Godhood. 

He glanced over at the crystalline bong sitting on the edge of his private floating island in the Celestial Sea. His friend Gabriel had given it to him as a novelty gift a few eons ago, but God had never used it. But today seemed like as good a day as any to finally try it out.

God packed the long glass tube with fragrant purple buds from the Cosmic ganja plant he had created long ago. He held a flame to the bowl and inhaled deeply, filling his infinite lungs.

At first, God didn't feel anything. But soon a calming, peaceful sensation flooded his omniscient mind. His eternal worries and anxieties faded away. A smile spread across his usually stern face. 

God left his island and went flying through space, giggling at nebulae and playing with comets’ tails. He created a few new galaxies on a whim, filled with fanciful animals and candy-colored plants. 

Eventually God's high faded, and he returned home. However, the divine insight he had gained while stoned remained. He realized that he had been too harsh on his creations. He vowed to show more patience, compassion, and humor. 

When God next checked on Earth, he was surprised to find humanity struggling as always. But instead of disappointment, God felt only love for the endearing flaws and foibles of humans. He sent a radiant rainbow stretching across the sky, hoping to bring them the same joy and wonder he now felt perpetually.

God knew, however, that he couldn't escape his duties for long. But from that day onward, once in a great while, God would pack another bowl of cosmic ganja, put on some celestial reggae music, and lounge in the clouds without a worry—the universe running on its own for a little while. His creations didn't seem to mind. In fact, God liked to think they understood.
