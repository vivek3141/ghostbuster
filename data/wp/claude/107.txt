The pounding on the front door startled me awake. I peered out the window to see a disheveled man frantically waving at me. I opened the door. 

"Please, you have to hide me!" he begged. "Someone is trying to kill me."

I didn't know who this stranger was, but the fear in his eyes looked real. I let him in.

"Thank you, thank you!" he said, panting heavily as if he had been running. I locked the door behind him.

"What's going on?" I asked. 

Before he could answer, there was another loud pounding. I peeked through the peephole to see my best friend Chris standing there, clutching a baseball bat. 

"Have you seen a guy run through here?" Chris shouted. "I need to teach him a lesson!"

My blood ran cold. What was Chris doing? I composed myself and opened the door slightly. 

"Hey Chris, what's up?" I said casually. 

"I'm looking for the jerk who just keyed my car," Chris growled. "Have you seen anyone?"

Keyed his car? That didn't sound like something worth killing someone over. I needed to defuse this situation, and fast.

"That's terrible about your car, but violence will only lead to more trouble," I said calmly. "Why don't you take a few deep breaths and relax. We'll file a police report about the vandalism. Revenge will not undo the damage."

Chris stood there, clenching and unclenching his fists, breathing heavily. After a tense moment, his shoulders slumped. "You're right," he mumbled. "I wasn't thinking straight."

"Come in, I'll make us some coffee and we can chat," I offered. Chris nodded and followed me in. I breathed a small sigh of relief that no one would be getting killed tonight. As for the stranger now hiding in my attic, I would have to figure out a way to sneak him out once Chris left. But for now, crisis averted, even if in the strangest of ways.
