The alley was dark and damp. I was walking home late after work, my hands in my pockets.Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows, brandishing a knife.  "Give me your wallet and phone, now!" the mugger demanded.

My heart raced. I had no weapons to defend myself. But I did have my pack of cards. An idea formed. 

Slowly, I pulled the deck of cards out of my jacket pocket, fanning them out to show the mugger. His eyes went wide.

"Pick a card, any card," I said with forced bravado. I started shuffling the cards, executing flashy cuts and spreads I had practiced for hours. The blades flashed silver in the dim light. 

The mugger stared, mesmerized by the flowing, whirling cards. His knife hand dropped to his side. 

When I finished my routine, I raised an eyebrow and asked "So, do you want to see a magic trick now?"

The mugger blinked, then shook his head quickly. He backed away, stumbling into the darkness. I heard his footsteps running off into the distance. 

My gamble had paid off. I slid my cards back into my pocket and walked home, my heart still pounding at my brush with danger and the realization that I had just performed the most important magic trick of my life.
