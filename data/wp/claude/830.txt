The sun set on the worst day of John's life. He sat in the dark, head in hands, devastated at how badly things had gone. His wife had left him. He lost his job. His dog passed away. In one terrible, gut-wrenching day, everything he cared about vanished. 

As midnight approached, the familiar options appeared before him:

Continue: Live with the consequences of this awful day and move on to an uncertain tomorrow.  

Restart Day: Wake up this morning again and try for a do-over. Make different choices, avoid the mistakes, cling to the fleeting moments of joy.  

Restart Life: Go back to the very beginning and start over from scratch. Build new memories and experiences, forge new paths, become someone else entirely.  

John was tempted to restart his life. Why trudge on in this broken reality when he could recapture the optimism of youth?  But he hesitated. He had lived a meaningful life, with loving relationships that spanned decades and events both tragic and triumphant that made him who he was. To wipe that away felt like losing himself.

He couldn't restart the day either. He couldn't un-live those awful moments or un-break what was now broken. There were no do-overs. 

With a heavy heart, John chose "Continue". The past was set, and while the future was uncertain, he still had time left to rebuild meaning from the ashes. The pain would lessen, new joys would come. He fell asleep clinging to the hope of tomorrow. Life moves on, the sun rises anew each day, and so must he.
