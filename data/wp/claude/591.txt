You stare at the mysterious message that popped up on your new phone's screen. "New Mission Available. Accept? [Yes] [No]"

What on earth? You didn't install anything that would prompt such a strange message. This must be some kind of weird spam or prank. You select "No" and the message disappears. 

A few days later, the message pops up again. This time you select "Yes" just to see what happens, ready to exit out of anything suspicious. A blank text entry box appears. "Await further instructions," the message reads.

Some kind of game? You wait, amused and slightly bewildered. Who would go to such effort for a prank?

Two days later, another message: "Proceed to 43.6738° N, 7.2639° E. Await contact." GPS coordinates? Some kind of geocaching puzzle. Your curiosity gets the better of you and you enter the coordinates into your maps app. They resolve to a location in southeastern France, not too far from your home. 

Your phone buzzes with an incoming message: "1933". A year? You shake your head, utterly perplexed now but too intrigued to stop. This must be an elaborate mystery or puzzle someone has set up. You've always been fond of puzzles and mysteries. 

"Congratulations, you have passed the first test. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to help right a past wrong. Report to the coordinates at 1932 hours. Come alone."

Part of you knows following strange instructions on your phone is a bad idea. But your sense of adventure is aroused. You pack light, tell a friend where you're going in case anything happens, and set off on the drive.  

As darkness falls, you park near the location and make your way to the precise coordinates, phone in hand. This is madness, you think. But you've come this far. 

A figure emerges from the shadows. "You received the messages," says a woman's voice. "We need your help to finish what we started decades ago. Will you join us to right an old wrong?"

Your eyes widen. What have you stumbled into? But all you can say is: "Yes."
