The old warehouse lurked at the end of the abandoned street, holding untold secrets behind its rusty metal door. Jill walked past it every day on her way to school, curious but too scared to venture inside. 

One day, Jill noticed the door was open just a crack. Her heart raced. Summoning her courage, she pulled it open with a loud creak and stepped in. Dusty sunlight streamed through high windows, illuminating a figure huddled in the corner. An old man sat on the floor, clutching a ragged teddy bear.

Jill approached slowly. "Are you OK?"

The man looked up with cloudy eyes. "I'm forgotten," he whispered.

"What do you mean?" asked Jill. 

"They say you die twice," he murmured. "Once when you stop breathing and again when your name is spoken for the last time. I have been dead for a long time, though my heart still beats."

Jill felt a wave of sadness. "What's your name?" 

The old man hesitated, as if the word felt foreign on his tongue. "Reginald." 

"It's nice to meet you Reginald. My name is Jill." She sat down next to him. "Do you have any family?"

Reginald shook his head. "Gone, long gone." A single tear rolled down his cheek.

Jill paused. "Reginald, I will remember your name. I will come visit you again."

Reginald's eyes shone. "You would do that?" he breathed. 

Jill smiled and squeezed his frail hand. "I would. You won't be forgotten again."

Reginald hugged his teddy bear tightly. For the first time in decades, he felt the spark of hope reignite in his chest. He knew, as long as Jill remembered, the second death would not come for him today.
