The bustling mall was filled with holiday shoppers rushing around, arms laden with bags and gifts. Carolers sang cheerful songs over the din of chatter and laughter.

I squeezed through the crowds, hoping to finish my shopping quickly so I could head home. As I turned into the home goods section, a hush suddenly fell over the nearby shoppers. An unnatural chill crept into the air. 

Standing by a table of scented candles was a tall, imposing figure. His skin was pale and flawless, and he was dressed impeccably in a suit as red as blood. As people walked by, his eyes would follow them with a hint of cruelty flickering in his gaze.

A woman tried to walk past him, laden with shopping bags. In a flash, he grasped her arm, stopping her in her tracks. She let out a shriek. His fingers were long, with nails that came to sharp points.

He leaned down and inhaled deeply next to her neck. "Fear," he purred. "Delicious." The woman began to tremble violently.

He released her with a low chuckle and she scrambled away, stumbling over her bags in her haste. His chilling laughter followed her.

People were backing away now, panic rippling through the crowd. I knew I should flee like the others, but morbid curiosity rooted me to the spot. His head swiveled, that piercing gaze finding me. A sinister smile slowly spread across his pale lips.

He strode forward until he was directly in front of me, looking deeply into my eyes. "You..." His voice seemed to echo from the depths of hell itself. "You're interesting. Do your friends know what you are?" 

My blood turned to ice. "I—I don't know what you mean," I stammered. 

He leaned in close and inhaled again, as if savoring some aroma. "No, I don't suppose you do," he said, a note of grim amusement in his tone. "But I can smell it on you." His fingers reached out and brushed my cheek with a touch colder than death.

Raw terror seized me and I wrenched away from him. He laughed once more, a sound devoid of all humanity, and vanished in a wisp of acrid smoke. 

The entire mall had emptied by now. I stumbled out to my car in a daze, my cheek still burning from that icy touch. His final words echoed endlessly in my mind: Do your friends know what you are? But I had no answer—I had no idea what I was. Or why the devil himself would appear before me, and mark me with fear. All I knew was that some darkness now lurked inside me, waiting to emerge.
