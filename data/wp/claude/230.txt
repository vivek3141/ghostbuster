The End of the World

As Captain Valiant gazed out at the crumbling skyscrapers of Metro City, a profound sadness overtook him. His nemesis, Dr. Dread, had finally won. He was right all along - humanity was not meant to last. 

For years, Valiant had thwarted Dread's schemes of global destruction. He thought he was fighting for justice and to protect the innocent. But now as the ground shook and fissures began opening up, swallowing entire city blocks, Valiant realized the truth. Mankind was simply not sustainable. For all the intelligence and creativity, the human race was ultimately doomed by its own hubris and short-sightedness.

Dread’s virus was irreversible and indiscriminate. It targeted human DNA itself, unraveling the very building blocks of life within days. Valiant’s super-senses could hear the screams and sense the suffering all around, as people dissolved into nothingness. His own body had begun breaking down, though at a slower rate due to his alien biology. But soon enough, he would be gone too. And with him, any trace of humanity.

As a child, Valiant had voyaged across the stars to Earth when his home planet met a similar fate. He was the last of his kind, and had hoped that by protecting the humans he could redeem his failure to save his own people. But the cosmic joke was that no matter the planet, sentient beings could never escape their own doom. Free will came with a price.

Hovering high above the crumbling city, watching the world end, Valiant smiled grimly. His nemesis had won, and he had lost hope. But for the first time, just briefly, he could see through Dread's eyes and understand the cold rationality of it all. And as the ground opened up to swallow him in turn, he could meet his end with the same grim acceptance of the inevitable that had driven his old foe all along. The world was ending - but in that moment, at least he knew why.
