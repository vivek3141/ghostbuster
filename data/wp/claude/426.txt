Satan knelt before the pearly gates of Heaven. "Father, I have seen the error of my ways. I repent and wish to return home."

God gazed down at his once favored angel. "Your rebellion caused great suffering. Why should I trust you again?"

"I pledge to serve you faithfully and spread your light." 

God considered this. If Satan was truly reformed, allowing him back would show infinite mercy. But his trust had to be earned.

"There is a small settlement of devout mortals. For 1 year, live among them in a mortal guise. Resist all temptation to sin. Then, return here, and if you remain pure, the gates of Heaven will open to you once more."

Satan readily agreed. He took the form of a wandering preacher and went to the settlement. At first, he reveled in devotion and resisted temptation.

Yet as months passed, an opportunity arose that proved irresistible. The settlement had been stricken by a plague. In a house he passed, Satan heard weeping. A child lay dying, in agony. Her parents pleaded for a miracle.

Satan could heal the child with a touch and be celebrated as a saint. But using power for mortal gain would be a sin.

Satan's hand shook as he backed away. The temptation shattered him, but he fled into the night.  

When he returned to Heaven, God saw Satan's choice had been out of true repentance. As Satan again assumed his angelic form, a tear of joy and remorse fell from his eye. The gates swung open. Satan was home.
