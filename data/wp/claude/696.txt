The dim fluorescent lights in the sterile hospital room buzzed softly as the final grains of sand slipped through the hourglass of my life. At 83, I had lived a long, full life with few regrets. But there was one that had haunted me for decades. 

A faint knock came at the door. "Come in," I rasped.

The door creaked open and a figure entered, backlit by the hallway lights. As my eyes adjusted, I gasped. It was the unmistakable visage of my youth, a young man of 19 with unruly red hair and a mischievous grin. The personification of the opportunity I had let slip through my fingers.

"You came," I whispered.

"I had to say goodbye to my old friend," he replied. His voice, though unchanged, now seemed tinged with a sadness that came of age and wisdom.

He came to stand by my bedside, hands in his pockets, gazing at me with an all-too familiar blend of affection, pity and regret. "You gave me up for a sense of duty, a desire to do the responsible thing. I can't blame you for that."  

I nodded weakly, unable to meet his eyes. "I thought it was the right choice. But I've regretted it ever since. Every time life got dull or hard or sad, I imagined what might have been if I'd taken that chance with you."

He smiled and reached out to take my wrinkled hand in his strong, youthful one. "I forgive you, old friend. And now it's time for me to go, and for you to rest."

A single tear rolled down my cheek. "Will I see you on the other side?" 

His eyes twinkled with the promise of new adventures to come. "I'll be here, waiting for you again. And this time, let's make sure you don't let me go."

He gave my hand a final squeeze, turned and walked out into the light. I gazed after him, heart swelling with long-awaited peace at last.
