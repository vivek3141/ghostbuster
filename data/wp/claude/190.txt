The streets were empty, as they had been for years. Not a single human could be found outdoors. Everyone was inside, barricaded in their homes, fearful of what might happen if they ventured out. 

Three years ago, every human on the planet had "gone prime" as it was called - spontaneously transforming into the peak physical and intellectual form. At first, it seemed a miraculous gift. Disease was eradicated, scientific breakthroughs occurred daily, and physical feats previously unimaginable became commonplace.

But soon the dark side emerged. With increased intelligence came increased ambition and hubris. Nations warred over new weapons and territories. Corporations battled for global domination. Those unable to cope with their newfound gifts descended into madness. 

Families turned on each other as primal instincts took over. Loved ones became competitors, and trust faded. The world descended into chaos.

Most retreated indoors, using their enhanced intellects to build impenetrable fortresses, surviving on renewable energy and automated food production. Going outside meant risking attack from roving gangs. 

Some believed the changes were permanent, while others hoped that one day the danger would pass and humanity would return to normal. But after three years, there were no signs of anyone "de-priming." 

Jenny peered out the window of her family's bunker at the abandoned street below. Her young children played in the corner, too young to remember the world before. Her husband Mark stood beside her, his brow furrowed.

"I'm going out there today," he said. "We can't stay locked inside forever. I'll be careful."

Jenny knew arguing was futile. His mind was made up. "Just promise me you'll come back," she said. 

Mark kissed her forehead. "I promise."

As the bunker door creaked open and Mark emerged, Jenny held her breath. She watched him take cautious steps into the center of the street, looking around nervously.

Nothing happened.

He turned and waved, smiling. Jenny waved back, feeling a glimmer of hope for the first time. Maybe, just maybe, the danger had finally passed. Maybe this was the day humanity would start emerging from the shadows, ready to rebuild and reconnect. She knew the road ahead would be long. But for the first time in years, she felt optimism start to prime her heart.
