The old abandoned warehouse loomed over Jenny and Mike as they walked up to the rusty metal door. "Are you sure about this?" Jenny asked nervously. 

Mike squeezed her hand reassuringly. "Don't worry, the guys said it would be fun. A quick in and out."

Jenny nodded, mustering her courage. She didn't have much of a choice. As the newest member of the neighborhood gang, she had to prove herself. And she didn't want Mike to think she was scared.

Mike slid open the heavy door with a shriek of metal on metal. The cavernous space inside was pitch black. "Hello?" Mike called out tentatively. There was no response. 

They took a few steps inside. Their eyes started to adjust to the darkness. Rusty equipment and discarded furniture were scattered around. But the place seemed empty.

"There's no one here," Jenny said, confused. "Did we get the wrong place?"

"I don't get it," Mike replied. He scratched the stubble on his chin. "This is weird. Let's look around."

They ventured deeper into the warehouse. Walking past a hulking piece of machinery, Jenny suddenly stopped. "Did you hear that?" she whispered. 

Mike nodded. There were whispers and muffled sounds coming from somewhere. They followed the sounds and walked around the machine. Jenny gasped. 

Three figures were tied up and gagged, squirming on the floor of a makeshift cage. As Jenny and Mike came into view, their eyes went wide. 

"What the hell?" Mike exclaimed. He rushed forward and ripped the gag off the nearest person. 

"Get us out of here!" the man cried. The other two made frantic muffled noises behind their gags.

"Who did this to you?" Jenny asked. She searched around for something to pry open the cage.

"No time to explain," the man said urgently. "He'll be back any minute!"

Mike found a metal bar and pried open the cage door. They helped the three captives out, removing their gags and untying their hands. 

"Come on, let's move!" said the first man. Rubbing their sore wrists, they all hurried toward the entrance. 

They emerged into the fading evening light. "Did you drive here?" the second man asked. Mike nodded. 

"Great, give us a ride into town," the third man said. The three captives didn't seem frightened or disoriented at all now. An uneasy feeling started to form in the pit of Jenny's stomach.

As they clambered into Mike's car, Jenny grabbed his arm. "Something's not right," she whispered. Mike gave her a look that said he felt it too. But it was too late to back out now.

Mike started the engine and pulled away from the warehouse. No one spoke. An ominous silence filled the car as they drove down the empty road. Jenny and Mike exchanged a worried glance. Only three were supposed to leave. So why were there five of them now?
