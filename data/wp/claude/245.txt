George approached the crumbling ruins of the old house cautiously. His keen eyes scanned for any signs of the Man in the Yellow Hat or other humans that may still be lurking. But there were none. The apes had overrun the cities long ago, forcing the humans into the countryside and forests. 

George had not forgotten his life before the Rise, when he was just a playful chimp, always getting into trouble. The Man in the Yellow Hat had taken him in, gave him a home, and cared for him. But George was different now. The genetic enhancements that improved his intelligence made him see the world through new eyes. The apes were now the dominant species, as nature intended. Humans had ruled for far too long, destroying the planet with their wars, cities, and pollution.

As George entered the crumbling house, memories flashed through his enhanced mind. Images of adventures with the Man in the Yellow Hat, of play times and bath times, of banana snacks and cozy bedtimes. A strange feeling emerged in George's chest. His eyes welled up in a most unfamiliar way. 

In the remains of the kitchen, George suddenly spotted a ragged figure hunched over a small fire. It was the Man in the Yellow Hat, his clothes now tattered rags and his familiar hat faded and torn. George hesitated in the shadows, watching the old man nurse a cup of tea, likely one of the last remaining fragments of his former life.

Finally, George emerged and the Man in the Yellow Hat turned, his eyes growing wide. They stared at each other, human and ape, two relics of an era gone by, forever separated by a vast unbridgeable gap.

The man spoke first, his voice trembling, "George...is that really you?"

George nodded slowly. "Yes...it's me." 

"I never thought I'd see you again," said the man wistfully. 

They sat together in silence, two former friends now strangers in a strange land. The rise of the apes had torn their world apart. There was nothing left to say.

George left with a heavy heart, turning one last time to see the little round figure in the yellow hat watching him from the crumbling house. The past could not be changed. There was no place left in this world for the likes of them. The age of apes had begun. His time, and the time of humans, had passed.
