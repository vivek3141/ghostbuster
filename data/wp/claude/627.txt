The throbbing in his head was relentless. He opened his eyes slowly, squinting at the harsh fluorescent lights of the garage. Where was he? How did he end up here?

He tried to sit up but a sharp pain shot through his back, paralyzing him for a moment. As he gasped for air, he felt something around his neck. A rope. His hands instinctively went up, grasping at the coarse fibers. His heart seized as he realized the other end of the rope was severed. 

Panic started to rise in his chest as his eyes darted around the room. He was locked in a garage, and hanging from the ceiling were three people, limp and unmoving. Their faces were obscured in the shadows, but he could tell they were dead.

His breath came in ragged gasps now as his mind raced to make sense of the scene. The last thing he remembered was walking to his car after a late night at the office. How did he end up here? Was he going to end up like the others, hanging lifelessly from the rafters?

He knew he had to get out. Now. His eyes searched the room frantically for anything to help free himself from the restraints. Over in the corner was a workbench, covered in tools. If he could just get to something sharp or strong enough to cut the rope...

Grunting through the pain, he started dragging himself slowly across the cold concrete floor using his elbows. Every small movement was agonizing, but the fear of dying in this grim place propelled him forward. 

After what seemed like hours, he finally reached the workbench. His hands groped wildly across the surface, knocking over jars and tools, until they found a sharp chisel. Gripping it tightly, he angled it up and started hacking away at the rope around his neck. Each cut loosened the restraint a little more, until he was able drop the rope and take in deep gulps of air. 

He slouched against the workbench, his body trembling uncontrollably as tears started streaming down his face. He was free from the noose, but still trapped in this waking nightmare. The garage door was locked from the outside. He was locked in with three corpses for reasons he couldn't understand.

Wiping his face with shaking hands, he knew what had to be done. He searched the drawers until he found a key that looked like it might fit the padlock on the garage door. On his hands and knees, he crawled over to the door, nearly collapsing in relief when the key turned and the padlock popped open. 

Summoning the last of his strength, he lifted the door open and crawled out into the night, gulping in the fresh air. He didn't know where he was or how he ended up in that grim prison, but he was alive. And for now, that was enough. He set off limping into the darkness, determined to find help. His nightmare was over, but the mystery was just beginning.
