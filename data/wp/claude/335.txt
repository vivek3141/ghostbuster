Dr. Victor Frankenstein was in his laboratory, putting the finishing touches on his latest creation. He has spent months assembling a hulking form from parts of cadavers, and now only needed to harness the power of lightning to bring it to life.
As he worked late into the night during a fierce thunderstorm, a loud bang on his door startled him. He opened it to find a muscular man in a tank top on his doorstep. "Are you ready for the competition tomorrow, doc?" asked the stranger.
Frankenstein stared in confusion. "Competition? I think you have the wrong person."
The man laughed. "Nice try, but I recognize you from your pictures in the papers. The whole town is buzzing to see the great Dr. Frankenstein compete in the citywide bodybuilding championship tomorrow!" He flexed his arms to reveal a massive tattoo reading "Budapest Bodybuilding Battle 1978."
Frankenstein protested that it was all a mistake, but the man refused to believe him. He had seen the ads in papers and heard the announcements praising the doctor's athletic achievements. Someone had made a mistake, but now the whole town expected to see him onstage. 
The stranger left, and Frankenstein grew worried. He didn't care about fame or glory, only advancing scientific knowledge. Yet his work depended on remaining in the good graces of the community. If he refused to show up, it might cause dangerous speculation and controversy.
The next morning, Frankenstein visited the competition venue, a grand opera house, hoping to straighten out the confusion. But the organizers were adamant that he was registered and the star attraction. Posters bore his name and image, which was just a generic engraving of a bearded man but was now advertised as "The Surgeon of Steel"!" 
A large crowd was gathering, cheering as Frankenstein protested in vain that it was a case of mistaken identity. He was rushed backstage and handed a tiny posing trunk to change into. He awkwardly squeezed into it just as the announcer boomed, "Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for...welcome your very own Frankenstein!"
The curtain rose, revealing Frankenstein in the trunks that stretched over his pale, unathletic frame. The excited crowd suddenly grew silent, jaws dropping in unison. 
Frankenstein stared helplessly at the audience, then at his own skinny body. The vast difference between their expectations and the reality of the situation slowly dawned on everyone.
A few nervous chuckles broke the silence, then escalated into raucous laughter. The announcer himself doubled over, apologizing into the microphone between fits of laughter. Frankenstein fled behind the curtain, embarrassed but relieved his secret was safe for another day. He vowed to be more careful to avoid any future mishaps that might jeopardize his important, if unorthodox, research.
