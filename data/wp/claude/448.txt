I don't know who else to ask.  

Jenny paced in her small apartment, wringing her hands. Her best friend Melissa had gone on a solo hiking trip in the mountains two days ago and hadn't returned. She was supposed to be back yesterday. Jenny tried calling her repeatedly but the calls went straight to voicemail. 

Panic started to set in. Melissa was an experienced hiker but accidents happen. The trails she was on were remote and difficult to access. Jenny checked online for news reports but found nothing about missing hikers matching Melissa's description.

She called the local park rangers station to report Melissa missing. "We can't do anything until she has been missing for at least 24 hours," the ranger told her over the phone. Jenny begged and pleaded but they would not budge.

In tears, she realized she had to take matters into her own hands. But she didn't feel confident doing a solo rescue attempt. She needed help. Her parents lived too far away. Her other friends were not avid hikers and she didn't want to endanger more people. 

Then she remembered Mark, a guy from her hiking club. He organized expeditions and knew the trails well. She gave him a call, her voice shaking. "Mark, I'm sorry to call you like this, but I don't know who else to ask. Melissa went hiking two days ago and hasn't returned. I'm really worried about her. Will you please help me look for her?"

To her relief, Mark agreed without hesitation. At daybreak the next morning, they set off on the trail Melissa had planned to take. For hours they searched, calling her name. When they were about to give up hope, Mark spotted Melissa's backpack and sleeping bag tucked under a rocky overhang. Melissa emerged, limping but alive. She had slipped and sprained her ankle badly, unable to make it back down the mountain.

With Mark's help, they got Melissa to the trailhead. She was battered and exhausted but would be okay. Jenny gave Mark a huge hug. She didn't know who else she could have turned to in this desperate situation. She was simply grateful he was there to help when no one else could. Together, they had saved her best friend's life.
