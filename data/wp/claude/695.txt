Last night the monsters returned. I was sound asleep when I heard the familiar scraping sounds coming from under the bed. Their long, gnarled claws scratching at the wooden floorboards as they slowly emerged from the darkness below. 

My heart seized in my chest. Why were they back? It had been years since I last heard those horrible noises, years since I saw their hideous forms slinking in the shadows of my room. I thought I had escaped them at last.

The scraping turned to pounding and rattling. They were shaking the bedframe now, trying to break free from their prison. I cowered under the covers, hoping in vain that they would not find me. I knew it was hopeless. They always found me.

An unearthly roar shook my walls as the first monster pulled itself up from the abyss. Its glowing red eyes peered at me through the darkness, filled with malice and hunger. Another roar answered, and I screamed. More were coming. 

I froze in terror as the creatures surrounded me, prodded me with their razor claws, jaws snapping at my face with dagger-like teeth. My throat tightened in panic and I thought my heart might burst in my chest, but I couldn't tear my eyes away from the horrors before me.

Just as the largest beast lunged at me, its fetid breath filling my nostrils, I woke with a jolt. My room was quiet and empty, moonlight filtering through the curtains. The monsters had returned to torment my dreams once more. I knew that as long as I lived, they would always be waiting for me in the darkness. Always waiting to make their horrible return.
