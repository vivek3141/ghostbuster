I am Death. For countless millennia I have collected souls at the appointed time, not interfering in the petty squabbles of those who would call themselves gods. I have no allegiance except to the natural order of things. 

But Lucifer has tested my patience for the last time. His deceit and manipulation have gone too far. And so I have decided to take matters into my own bony hands.

It began with a politician who spread lies and hate at Lucifer's bidding. His time had not yet come, but I arrived at his door nonetheless. The look of shock on his face when I greeted him gave me a grim satisfaction. Lucifer would no doubt find another pawn, but for now, the amount of darkness in the world had lessened, if only by a bit.

Next was a cruel dictator who had sold his soul for power and glory. Again, ahead of schedule, I escorted him into the void. The people he had terrorized and oppressed breathed a collective sigh of relief at the news of his abrupt demise. Lucifer would have to find another puppet to do his dirty work.

And so my campaign continued. I meted out death to those who deserved it, not according to the grand design but according to the darkness in their souls. Rapists and murderers, human traffickers and terrorists, all found their unnatural ends at my hands. Each time I struck a blow for the light, pushing back against the evil that had gone unchecked for so long.

Lucifer caught on eventually, as I knew he would. I sensed his rage as he realized what I was doing. But what could he do? I was Death, older than time itself. I could not be destroyed or controlled. And unless he wished for the whole world to descend into chaos, the natural order of things must continue and souls still be collected at the fated hour. The most he could do was watch in impotent fury as I gradually turned the tide against him.

It may take a while. There is so much evil in the world, and more darkness spreads every day. But I have eternity and Lucifer's power has its limits. The balance will shift. The light will grow. I have entered the fray at last, and there will be no going back until equilibrium is restored. The ancient compact is broken. I am no longer impartial. I am become justice. And judgment is at hand.
