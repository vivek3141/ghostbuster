I had always been able to stop time. Since I was a little kid, I discovered I had this strange ability. When I concentrated, everything and everyone around me froze in place. I could walk around, explore, do whatever I wanted while time was stopped. I kept it a secret, afraid of how others might react. 

One day, as a teenager, I was in a hurry to get to school. I stopped time so I could sleep in an extra 30 minutes. When time stopped, I got out of bed and started getting ready. As I walked past my window, something caught my eye outside. A woman was walking down the street—but she was still moving. Everything else was frozen, but she walked down the sidewalk at a normal pace.

I stared in shock. In all the times I had stopped time, nothing and no one had ever still been moving. Who was this woman? How could she not be frozen?

I ran out of my house to get a closer look at her. She seemed like an ordinary woman, dressed for work in a skirt and blouse. As I stared, she suddenly stopped walking and turned to look directly at me. "It's you, isn't it?" she asked. "You're the reason why everything else is stopped."

My mouth fell open. "How—how do you know about that?" I stammered. "And how are you not affected?"

She gave me a knowing smile. "Because I have the same ability. I can stop time too. But when others like us use the ability, we remain unfrozen. We're the only two I've found in my lifetime with this gift."

I couldn't believe it. All this time I had thought I was alone, and now I find out there's someone else like me. A million questions flooded into my mind.

She held up her hand. "I know you have a lot of questions. And we have all the time in the world to discuss them." She grinned at her little joke. "But for now, just know that you are not the only one. Our gift binds us together, outside of time, you and I."

I gazed at this mysterious woman, feeling not alone for the first time in my life. We were two of a kind. And together, we had an eternity to share.
