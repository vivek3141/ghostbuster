The old rusted bell above the door jangled as Mark stormed into the diner. His face was flushed and he looked ready to explode. 

Flo, the waitress, looked up from her crossword and sighed. It was going to be one of those days.

Mark slid into his usual booth, slamming his briefcase onto the table. Flo sauntered over, pot of coffee in hand, and filled his mug.

"Rough day, hun?" she asked.

Mark snorted. "You could say that. My idiot boss has no clue what he's doing. The man wouldn't know a good idea if it hit him in the face. But does he listen to me? Of course not. Been there for 15 years but he still treats me like some junior accountant!"

Flo slid into the seat across from him, settling in for the rant she knew was coming. 

"And the workload!" Mark threw up his hands, nearly knocking over his coffee. "Does he not realize I'm only one person? I can't do the work of a whole team. But every single time I ask for help, he tells me to stop whining and figure it out!"

"He sure sounds difficult," Flo said, nodding sympathetically. 

"Difficult? Try impossible!" Mark spat. "Man hasn't given me a raise in three years. Three years! But sure enough he just bought himself a brand new Porsche. I'm telling you, Flo, if I have to endure one more day working for that miserable tightwad, I'll lose it!"

Mark finally paused to take a breath. Flo gave his hand a comforting pat. "I know it's hard, hun. But don't you worry, you'll figure something out. You always do."

Mark sighed and smiled at Flo. "Thanks for listening. I knew I could count on you."

"Anytime," Flo said with a wink. "That's what I'm here for. Now how about a slice of pie to make your day better?"
