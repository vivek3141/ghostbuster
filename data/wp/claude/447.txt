The last video game I played was Horizon Zero Dawn. In that game, the main character is Aloy, a skilled hunter and warrior in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by robots. If Aloy was hunting me down, I would be in serious trouble.

I peered out the window of my suburban home, on high alert. Somewhere out there, the dangerous Aloy was tracking me. I had no special skills or weapons to defend myself. I was easy prey.

In the distance, I spotted a flock of mysterious metal birds flying in a V-formation. As they got closer, I realized with horror that they were Watchers—robotic raptors scouting the area. They must be searching for me on Aloy's orders. I ducked down, hoping they didn't spot me through the window.

A few minutes later, I heard a twig snap in the yard. Cautiously, I peered out again. This time I saw a larger robot, a Sawtooth, pacing in front of my house. It was modeled after a jaguar and had wicked-looking metal claws. My blood ran cold. 

I knew Aloy must be controlling these robots remotely, maneuvering them into position around my house. At any moment, she could launch an attack. I was trapped with no means of escape.

In the distance, I spotted a figure approaching—a young woman with fiery red hair and a bow slung over her shoulder. Aloy had found me at last. She strode confidently toward my house, flanked by two spear-wielding robots.

Aloy raised her arm and pointed at my house. The robots lunged forward, ready to tear into the walls to get at me. I stumbled away from the window in terror.

Aloy was the most skilled hunter in the land. I was just an average person with no special abilities. Against her and an army of vicious robots, I didn't stand a chance. My fate was sealed. The hunt was over. I was screwed.
