I took a deep breath and knocked on the worn wooden door of my old college dorm room. This was madness, but I had no other choice. 

After the time travel experiment went awry, I found myself stranded 15 years in the past with nothing but the clothes on my back. No money, no ID, no way to get back to my own time. I lived on the streets for years, desperately trying to figure out a way home while avoiding changing the timeline too dramatically.

Now, at my wits end, I was about to come face to face with my naive 20-year-old self. Would he even believe my wild story?

The door creaked open. "Yeah?" my younger self said. My heart clenched at seeing his unlined face. 

I cleared my throat. "I know this will sound impossible, but I'm you. From the future."

He blinked, then laughed. "Good one, man. Seriously, what do you want?" 

I scratched my chin, graying beard and all. "Check your right pocket. There should be a freckle."

His smug look faded. He reached into his pocket and his eyes went wide. "How...how did you know about that?"

"Because I'm you," I said gently. "15 years from now, there will be an accident with a time machine, and I'll get stranded here. I've been living in the past, trying to survive without changing too much, for 5 years now."

"This is crazy," my younger self breathed, staring at my aged face. But I could see the dawning comprehension. I *was* him, just with the experiences of another 15 years of living.

"I need help," I said simply. "A place to clean up, some cash to get started again. I want to get back to my own time without altering the timeline too much. Will you help me?"

He glanced at my threadbare, unwashed clothes and unkempt beard and nodded slowly. "On one condition." I raised an eyebrow. "You have to tell me everything. What my - I mean, our - life is like in the future. Deal?"

I grinned, the first time in years. "Deal."

He ushered me into the familiar dorm room, nowfilled with clues to who I used to be. This was the beginning of a strange partnership, working together across a gap of 15 years, both completely the same and yet irrevocably different. Two versions of one person, trying to put right what had gone very wrong.  But at that moment, I was just grateful to sit, get a hot shower, and share some pizza with my unlikely new old friend - myself.
