The metallic taste of adrenaline filled my mouth as I looked down the scope of my rifle at the figure strolling through the piazza below. The world's greatest assassin, known only as Ghost, was enjoying an espresso at a cafe, utterly unaware he had a target on his back. 

I had spent years honing my craft, devising new poisons, mastering long range shots, and ensuring my kills looked like accidents. I was the best in the world—except for Ghost. His kills were works of art, so subtle and discreet no one even realized foul play was involved. He had evaded capture for decades.

But today his luck would run out. I had tracked him for months, anticipating his every movement. He kept to a strict routine, going to the piazza every Tuesday at 3pm. His vulnerability was his arrogance in thinking he was untouchable. My client, a powerful mobster whose father Ghost had killed, wanted the assassin's reign of terror ended once and for all. And I was going to grant that wish.

As Ghost strolled to the fountain, I steadied my aim and placed my finger on the trigger. In mere seconds, with a gentle squeeze, the greatest assassin who ever lived would be no more. I felt a surge of excitement at accomplishing what no one else could.

Just then, a laser dot appeared on my own chest, dancing around rapidly. I realized with dread that I had been outmaneuvered—in my quest to find the world's greatest assassin, I had exposed myself to becoming a target. As a shot rang out and everything faded to black, the last thing I saw through my rifle scope was Ghost casually finishing his espresso, a silenced pistol by his side.
