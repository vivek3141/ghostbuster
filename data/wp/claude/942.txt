The old man was a fool. Did he not realize I could see through his pathetic attempts at deception? His mind was going, that much was clear. 

He thought he could outwit me with his tales of wonder and adventure. As if I didn't know the true reason he had come. Fortune and glory, as always. Though cleverly disguised as some noble quest, I saw through to the rot at his core. Ambition and greed.

Yet still I indulged the old fool. It amused me to let him spin his yarns, to grant small favors and watch hope spring eternal in his rheumy eyes. He told me of treasures and kingdoms as if I cared for such trinkets. My prize was far greater.

When his stories were done and requests made,  I would bargain with him. His inevitable frustration and anguish as he sacrificed more and more fed my ancient soul. Sometimes I wondered if he realized the doom that lay behind my smiled and gifts. 

Still he returned, time and again, hell-bent on accomplishing his 'mission.' The more he tried, the more entangled in my web he became. His destiny was sealed, even as he grasped at one last chance for victory.

In the end, I almost pitied the faithful old fool. When his final treasure was laid at my gnarled feet, I knew my triumph was complete. As his body crumbled into dust, his anguished eyes met mine. Only then did he understand my true power and the futility of his lifelong quest.

For no man may take the treasure I have guarded for eternity. My name is Death, and none escape my embrace.
