INT. SMALL DARK CAVE - NIGHT 

THREE figures huddle around a small FIRE, faces obscured by hooded cloaks. The LEADER, tallest of the three, stares into the flames.

                         LEADER
           The time has come. The Usurper's forces 
           march on the capital. By week's end, he'll sit 
           upon the Iron Throne. 
The others SHIFT uncomfortably. 

                         FOLLOWER 1  
           But the true King is dead. What can we do?

                         LEADER  
           The Baratheons may have won the war, but we 
           have not yet lost. The Targaryens still live.

The Leader pulls back his hood, revealing shoulder-length silver hair. 

                         FOLLOWER 2  
                (gasping)
           You're - you're one of them! A Targaryen!

The Leader nods. 

                         LEADER  
           The last son of the Mad King. I've lived in 
           shadow all these years, waiting for the proper 
           time to reclaim my family's throne. 

                         FOLLOWER 1  
           With all due respect, the people will never 
           accept another Targaryen ruler. 

                         LEADER  
           Not through force, no. I mean to take back the
           Seven Kingdoms through _fire and blood_.

The Followers exchange a worried glance.  

                         CUT TO:

EXT. KINGS LANDING - DAY

The city bustles below the Red Keep. PEASANTS mill about the streets as SPRING BREEZE carries scents of BREAD and FISH.

INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY   

KING BARATHEON, a great brute of a man, lounges on the Iron Throne. His KNIGHTS and COUNSELORS debate various matters of state before him.

A MESSENGER rushes into the hall, panting. He falls to one knee before the throne.  

                         MESSENGER   
           Your Grace! Terrible news from the east. The 
           city of Myr is under attack - by dragons!

Murmurs of shock ripple through the room. The King's face darkens ominously.

                         KING BARATHEON  
           Dragons, you say? But they've been dead for 
           centuries. What foolish jape is this?

The Messenger shakes his head frantically.  

                         MESSENGER  
           No jape, Your Grace. The city burns. Merchant  
           ships saw three dragons unleashing fire and 
           blood upon the Myrmen. The Targaryen beasts 
           have returned.  

The King grips the arms of the Iron Throne, expression grim.  

                                                           FADE OUT.

END OF SCENE.
