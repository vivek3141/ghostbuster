The crew thought they had planned the perfect heist. Johnny “Two-Fingers” DeLuca, Vinny “The Shark” Napolitano, and “Mad Dog” Mike  Michaels were going to rob the First National Bank of Springfield, the largest bank in the county. They had devised an elaborate scheme to break into the vault at night, disable the security system, and make off with the contents of over 200 safe deposit boxes before the guards made their morning rounds.

In the dead of night, they put their plan into action. Vinny took out the security cameras with precision strikes from his slingshot. Mad Dog knocked out the guards with tranquilizer darts. And Two-Fingers expertly cracked the vault lock, swinging open the thick steel door. 

“Jackpot!” exclaimed Two-Fingers, eyeing the rows of safe deposit boxes filled with cash, gold, and jewels. 

They hastily emptied box after box into large duffel bags, not paying attention to the amounts or contents. In their haste and excitement over the massive haul, they didn’t notice one of the guards start to stir from his tranquilized sleep.

As they emerged from the vault, bags in hand, the guard woke up and reached for his radio to call in reinforcements. Mad Dog panicked and smashed the radio with his crowbar, but it was too late. The call had gone out.

They heard sirens approaching in the distance, loudly signaling the arrival of the police.

“The cops are onto us!” yelled Shark. “We gotta get outta here now with whatever we got!”

They fled the bank and tossed the bags into the back of their van, peeling away down the empty streets just as the cops pulled up, lights flashing. They had gotten away, but in their haste they realized they had only made off with a fraction of the vault's contents. Their flawless scheme had been foiled.

 A week later, Two-Fingers turned on the news to see the bank president announcing new security measures after a “minor burglary” at the First National Bank. The crew looked at the bags of cash and gold lining their hideout. In their panic, they still made off with over $5 million in loot. Their fatal mistake had turned into the perfect crime.
