The clock struck midnight and I felt a tingle in my body. My 21st birthday had arrived. But this was no ordinary birthday—this was the day my mutation would appear. 

Most kids look forward to their 21st birthday, dreaming of what power or ability they might develop. Some gain physical mutations like claws, horns or wings. Others develop mental powers like telekinesis, enhanced intelligence or X-ray vision. You never know what you might get.

I was terrified. I didn't want any of this. I just wanted to stay normal.

I felt the tingle turn into a surge of energy coursing through my veins. My heart started racing as panic set in. What was happening to me?

I ran to the bathroom and stared into the mirror. To my relief, I looked the same. No horns, claws or other visible physical changes. I took a deep breath. Maybe I would get an innocuous power, like the ability to glow in the dark. I could live with that.

Just then, I heard my parents talking downstairs. At first, their conversation seemed normal. But within a minute, their voices became high-pitched chipmunk squeaks. I froze in terror and confusion. Was I hearing things?

I crept down the stairs and peeked into the living room. My parents were sipping tea and chatting like normal. But the sounds coming from their mouths were cartoonish squeaks and squawks.

With a rising sense of horror, I realized this must be my mutation —some kind of enhanced hearing or sound distortion ability. This was awful!  I rushed back to my room and buried myself under the covers, hoping I could make the sounds go away. But I could still hear the squawking through the walls.  

A few minutes later, there was a knock on my door. “Honey, are you OK?” my mother chirped. 

I groaned. “Mom, I can hear...strange squeaking sounds. Is this my mutation?”

She was silent for a moment. “Oh dear, enhanced hearing can be quite an adjustment. But don’t worry, we’ll get you some noise-canceling headphones and help you cope.”

I sighed, a mix of relief and continued fear coursing through me. At least I didn’t have visible horns or claws. But super-hearing was going to take a lot of getting used to. My parents were trying to reassure me, but all I heard were their incessant high-pitched squeaks and squawks.  

This was definitely not the 21st birthday gift I had hoped for. My life would never be the same again. But as the squeaks and squawks continued in the background, I realized at least I was surrounded by my loving, supportive family. And that’s what really mattered, whether I could hear them normally or not.
