The alarm blared again. The Big Bad Wolf groaned and slammed his paw down on the clock. This was the third time this week the security system had gone off in the middle of the night. 

He dragged himself out of bed and stomped over to the monitor. There, on the grainy footage, were the Three Little Pigs trying to sneak into the brick house. Again. He growled and stomped out of his cottage, not even bothering to put on his menacing cloak.

"Hey!" he barked. The pigs froze in their tracks. "Do you have any idea what time it is?"  

The pigs squealed in terror and scurried off into the forest, knocking over trash cans and flower pots along the way. The wolf just shook his head, too tired to give chase. He armed his security system again and trudged back to bed.

The next morning, there was an angry knock at his door. He opened it to find the Goat from the old MacDonald farm, face red with rage.

"Your wolves were out chasing my goats again last night! This has to stop!"
 
The wolf sighed. "I don't have any wolves. I'm just one wolf. And I was here all night dealing with those pigs again."

The goat blinked. "Oh. Well, then I apologize. I'll talk to Old MacDonald about securing their fence better." He trotted off.

The wolf closed the door and sagged against it. Being the Big Bad Wolf meant nonstop annoyance and responsibility. Maybe it was time for a vacation. He wondered if that resort in the Bahamas allowed wolves...

He chuckled to himself. Unlikely. Oh well, at least scaring pigs and goats was job security. He put on a pot of coffee and got ready to see what other troubles the day would bring. The life of a Big Bad Wolf was never dull, that's for sure.
