The Veil Between Worlds 

by Your Assistant

Jenny always felt like there was something just beyond her senses. A presence she couldn't quite perceive. As a child, she would get strange feelings walking through the woods near her home. Feelings of being watched, followed. But when she spun around, nothing was there.

As she got older, the feelings grew stronger and more frequent. Not just in the woods but in the empty school hallways or alone in her room at night. She started to wonder if she was losing her mind. She didn't dare tell anyone, afraid they might think she was crazy.

One night, Jenny woke with a start. The feeling was overwhelming, like something was in the room with her. Watching and waiting. She lay still, heart pounding, straining her eyes in the darkness. 

And then she saw it. A faint shimmering in the air. Like a heat wave, but in the middle of the night. It seemed to move and drift across her room.

She froze in terror. What was this strange apparition? As it moved closer, details started to emerge from the undulating air. She could make out a humanoid form, a head, limbs, but they looked distorted as if through thick glass.

The form paused at the foot of her bed, as if studying her. Jenny's breath caught in her throat. She couldn't scream, couldn't move. She stared into the strange, rippling face of the creature and realized with dawning horror that this was what she had sensed her whole life. This creature that moved through the veil between worlds, mostly unseen and unperceived. But she had always felt it there, brushing up against the ragged edge of human senses.

The creature reached out an arm toward her, the air shimmering and warping around its limb. She cringed away, still paralyzed in fear. But its fingers stopped just short of her face, hesitating. 

Slowly, very slowly, one of its distorted fingers pointed at its own eyes. Then at hers. A gesture she understood instantly. It could see her, but she could barely see it. A glimpse through the veil was all that was allowed.

The message delivered, the creature pulled its arm back and retreated into the shadows, dissolving from view until the shimmering faded away and her room was empty once more. But she knew she would never be alone again. The creatures unknown to us are still there, moving through the veil, watching and waiting just beyond the edge of human senses. Always just out of sight.
