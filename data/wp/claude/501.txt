The old clock tower chimed midnight.  James smiled as he looked out at the empty town square below his window. Everyone was asleep, blissfully unaware of the paradise he had created.

 Just yesterday, the town was in chaos. His device had worked perfectly. At noon, it emitted a pulse that slowed time to a crawl for everyone but him. As the townspeople froze in place, he reorganized everything to his liking. 

He moved people and objects around like pieces on a board game. A few clicks and life became ideal. The bully who terrorized the schoolyard suddenly found himself in an embarrassing situation. The old widow down the street won the lottery. His crush was now staring adoringly at him, trapped in a passionate embrace.
 
But now time was moving again. In a few hours, the world would revert back to its imperfect self.  The chaos and struggles would return. The widow would lose her winnings.  The bully would be unleashed.  His love would slip through his fingers once more. 

James sighed as the clock struck one. The best of times, and the worst of times. But for a few fleeting hours, he had crafted his version of utopia in this little town. He knew it couldnâ€™t last. But in his memories, it always would. Paradise was forever frozen at midnight.
