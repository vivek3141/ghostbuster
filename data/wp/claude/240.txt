The old floorboards creaked under my feet as I walked down the long hallway of my home, heading to bed after a long day. The only light came from the porch light outside, filtering through the peephole in my front door and casting a tiny speck of illumination in the otherwise dark hall. 

As I made my way to the bedroom, my mind wandered to thoughts of finally relaxing under the covers. The kids were in bed, the dishes were done, and I had a few hours of peace before having to do it all over again tomorrow. My tired feet padded along the familiar path in the dark, not needing any light to know the way.

When I was about halfway down the hall, the speck of light from the porch abruptly slid into darkness. I froze in place, my heart skipping a beat. The power must have gone out. But no, the digital clocks in the kids' rooms down the hall were still glowing, and I could see the faint blue light from their nightlights peeking out from under their doors. 

A chill ran down my spine as realization dawned - someone had turned off the porch light. I stood still, listening, but couldn't hear anything out of the ordinary. The house was quiet. A battle raged in my mind between logic and fear. I told myself it must have just been a fluke, the bulb burning out. But the timing felt off. I had to know for sure.

Summoning my courage, I tiptoed down the creaking hallway in darkness, navigating from memory. At the front door, I peered through the peephole, hoping the porch light had just come back on. But outside was pitch black. My heart pounded as I flipped on the front lights, flinging open the door to find...an empty front porch. The light bulb looked perfectly intact. 

I quickly shut and locked the door, flipping off the porch light once more. As I hurried down the hallway, I realized that for tonight at least, darkness would be my companion. The familiar path to bed no longer felt quite so familiarâ€”and I couldn't get there fast enough. I slipped under the covers, safe at last but still wondering about the mystery of the light in the dark.
