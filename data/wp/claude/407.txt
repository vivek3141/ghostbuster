The old sword sat in the dusty attic, forgotten for decades. Its handle was worn but the blade was still sharp, keenly reflecting a sliver of light that pierced the gloom. 

Mark found the sword while searching for old photos to show his young son. As he gripped the handle, memories flooded his mind. His own father teaching him sword fighting techniques in the backyard. The clack of wooden practice swords echoing between the trees. His father's patient instruction on posture, footwork, and the importance of honor.

Mark had forgotten about the sword after his father passed away. But now, holding it again, he felt a surge of bittersweet nostalgia.

That evening, Mark brought the sword to show his son. "This was your grandfather's," he said. "He taught me how to fence with it."

His son's eyes grew wide. "Really? You know how to use a sword?" 

Mark smiled. "I did once. I was quite good! My father and I would practice for hours."

"Will you teach me?" his son asked eagerly. 

Mark hesitated. But seeing the boy grip the sword, his hands small but firm around the worn handle, brought memories of learning at his own father's side.

"If you wish, I will teach you," Mark said. "But you must always remember—a sword is not a toy. It is a responsibility."

His son nodded solemnly. "I will remember."

The next morning, Mark awoke early and went out to the yard. He performed the warm-up exercises his father had taught him, movements ingrained in his muscle memory though long left dormant.  

His son burst from the house, eyes bright with excitement. Mark beckoned him over and handed him the sword. "We will start with basic technique. Now, follow my lead. And remember—this is not a game. This is a time-honored tradition, and a bond between us that must not be broken."

The boy nodded, gripping the sword tightly. A bird chirped somewhere in the trees and the sun glinted off the blade, as sharp as the day it was first drawn from its sheath. The time had come, at last, to pass the sword on to a new generation.
