After you die, you find yourself in a small room with a strange device. Upon examination, you find that it allows you to design who you'll be in your next life.  

I blinked open my eyes and looked around in confusion. The last thing I remembered was lying in the hospital bed, my family around me, the steady beep of the heart monitor slowing down and then flatlining as I took my last breath.

Yet here I was, seemingly alive and in a white room I didn't recognize. In the center of the room was a large console with a glowing screen.

I approached it hesitantly. Words flashed across the screen: "Welcome. You have been given an opportunity to design your next life. Please input details on the console and when finished press the flashing green button."

My finger hovered over the console. I could design my next life? Choose what I would look like, who I would be born to, what part of the world I would grow up in? The possibilities seemed endless. 

I tapped in a few options, increasing my height, choosing blue eyes instead of brown, selecting parents with artistic professions. But as I started to lock in more choices, doubt crept into my mind. Did I really want to choose everything about my next life? So much of the beauty and meaning I found in life came from its unpredictability, the random acts of kindness from strangers, discovering new interests by chance.

I took a step back from the console, taking a deep breath. After living a full life with ups and downs, joy and sorrow, was controlling all the variables of my next life really what I wanted? 

In the end, I wiped the console clean of my choices. "Please proceed to the next life with a random selection," I typed. 

I pressed the flashing green button, my heart swelling with anticipation about the new adventures that awaited me, the new stories I would craft, and the new relationships I would forge. The unknown possibilities stretched endlessly before me, and I embraced the mystery of my next life with open arms.

The screen flashed white and I closed my eyes, ready to be born anew. My next life was beginning.
