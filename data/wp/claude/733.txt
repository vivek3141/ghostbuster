The summons came in the mail, just a plain white envelope with "Jury Duty" stamped on the front. Mark sighed. His civic duty called, even if he did have other "priorities" to tend to. 

Mark took his seat in the jury assembly room. Lawyers and court officials filtered through the crowd, assessing potential jurors for an upcoming trial. "We have a murder trial coming up, involving the serial killings that have been in the news lately," the judge announced. Mark froze. This could be a problem.

Mark was called for the jury pool. As the lawyers asked their questions, he tried to seem indifferent. Don't get chosen, he pleaded silently. But fate betrayed him, and he was selected for the jury.

The trial began. A young man named Timothy was accused of the murders that had been terrorizing the city. As the prosecutors brought out evidence, Mark stewed silently. This was wrong. Timothy didn't commit those crimes. I did. 

Mark had been careful, cleaning up after his sinister deeds and leaving no trace behind. Now an innocent man was being framed for his actions. His dark secret was going to destroy a life. The thought awakened something Mark scarcely recognized: a conscience. 

In the jury room, Mark's fellow jurors were ready to convict. "He's guilty as sin," one said. Mark took a breath. "I'm not convinced," he said. The others looked incredulous. Mark launched into arguments to sow seeds of doubt, and one by one, the jurors began to waver. After lengthy debate, they returned to court as a hung jury.

Timothy was released, his life still intact. Mark knew the police would continue their search, but he had bought some time. And time was all he needed to fade away into the shadows where killers belong. 

His thirst for death appeased, Mark's desire to kill vanished. His close call in court had reminded him that every life has value, and no one deserves to fall prey to a monster like him. And so the serial killer disappeared. Justice had turned a blind eye, but just this once, Mark didn't mind. Saving one life helped atone for taking so many others. For the first time, Mark felt human. All because he had jury duty.
