The judge banged his gavel and said with a frown, 
"You stand accused of crimes all over town.
Theft and assault and disturbing the peace,
These are offenses I do not release.
However, I'll make you an offer today, 
If you rhyme, I'll let you go on your way."

I stood up tall, my mind in a whirl,
Rhyming in court, it seemed quite unfurl.
But freedom was calling, the offer too sweet,
Rhyming I would, from head to feet!

"Your honor, dear sir, I accept your decree, 
Rhyme I shall, as happy as a bee!
The crimes I committed, I do regret,
If you allow me, my freedom I'll get."

The judge nodded, "Very well, have your say,
Rhyme away, but don't rhyme all day!
350 words is all you get, 
So best get to rhyming, my poetic pet!"

I cleared my throat and began my defense, 
Hoping my rhyming skills were quite intense:

"The theft you accused me of, your honor, is wrong, 
I found that item, it didn't belong.
I meant to return it, I truly did,  
But time got away, I'm just a kid.

The assault was an accident, a mistake,
I tripped on a rock, for heaven's sake!
I fell on that man, I did not plan,
To harm my fellow, my good man.

For disturbing the peace, I have no excuse,
I was overly loud, I will produce,
A plan to make amends, a goodwill mission,
To resolve that particular condition.

I hope I have rhymed to your satisfaction,
And gained from this court a legal traction. 
My freedom today, kind sir, if you will,
I shall not take for granted, nor ever fulfill

My thirst for trouble, if you set me free,   
A law abiding citizen I shall be.
Your honor, dear judge, I rest my case,      
Please pardon me and my offenses efface!"   

The judge grinned wide and pounded his gavel,
"You're free to go, your rhyming travel,
Has earned you pardon, so take this chance,
And walk out free, but no more fence dance!"

I thanked the good judge and walked out the door, 
Relieved that my rhyming had evened the score. 
My freedom I earned with some silly verse,  
A most peculiar yet wonderful curse!
