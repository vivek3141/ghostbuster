The Discovery 

The news stunned the world. After decades of searching the cosmos, the massive array of radio telescopes had found no signs of life elsewhere. No faint alien broadcasts. No methane signatures of distant microbes. Only endless silence.

Jill sat in her backyard gazing at the stars, overwhelmed by a feeling of loneliness. In the vastness of space, Earth was but a small blue dot. And now it seemed destined to remain isolated. 

A rustle shook Jill from her thoughts. A tiny frog perched on a leaf, surveying the evening. A firefly drifted by, flashing its signal to others in the dark. The sounds of crickets rose and fell. An owl hooted in the distance. 

Jill realized that while humanity yearned to find companionship in the stars, life was secretly all around. The Earth teemed with millions of other species, a vast array of biodiversity as far as the eye could see. 

She smiled up at the night sky. The universe could keep its alien civilizations and wonderous vistas. Jill would revel in the miracle that was here - complex, lush, abundant, and endlessly fascinating. They may be alone, but life on Earth was far from empty. Jill knew now that this small blue world would always be enough.
