Diet Coke gazed across the kitchen counter at the mysterious stranger â€“ a roll of fresh mint Mentos. She had seen him before, of course, visiting the other soda bottles and making quite a splash. But she had never imagined they would end up side by side, alone together. 

Her carbonated heart bubbled with excitement. "Hello," she said coyly, her label fluttering. "We meet again."

"Indeed we do," Mentos replied smoothly. "And what a lovely coincidence it is." He smiled, his gelatinous green eyes twinkling. 

A rush of bubbles flooded Diet Coke's aluminium body. She felt herself fizzing uncontrollably, as if she might explode right then and there. She took a deep breath to compose herself. "I've noticed the way you make the other sodas froth and spray. You seem to have quite an...effect."

Mentos chuckled. "It's just a natural talent I have. But I have to admit, I was hoping to get you alone, Diet Coke. There's something special about you." He rolled closer. "You have a certain...effervescence that I find irresistible."

Diet Coke was carbonating at maximum capacity now, practically bursting with bubbly passion. "Oh, Mentos, I feel the same way about you! When I'm around you, I feel so fizzy, like I could pop and burst at any moment!"

"Then what are we waiting for?" With a wink, Mentos dropped dramatically into Diet Coke's open bottle top. 

There was a huge eruption of foam, spraying in all directions. Diet Coke exploded out of the bottle, surging up and out like a fountain. The bubbles overflowed her container, frothing and popping in a frenzy of expelled carbonation. 

As the misty spray descended and the bubbles subsided, silence fell over the kitchen. On the counter, the empty Diet Coke bottle lay on its side. Inside, two spent Mentos candies nestled together, their work done but their ace of hearts joined forever. The End.
