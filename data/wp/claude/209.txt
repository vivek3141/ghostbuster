The old farmhouse stood silent as I pulled up the long gravel driveway. So many memories here, mostly happy, but there was always an undercurrent of not belonging. 

My parents left me this place when they died, but I hadn’t visited in over 10 years. Now with my own kids nearly grown, it seemed the right time to come back. As I walked through the creaky front door, everything looked the same. The plaid couch, the oak dining table, the rag rug by the stone fireplace. It was like stepping into a time capsule.

Yet I felt like an intruder. The energy of the house seemed to reject my presence, like an immune system fighting off an infection. The voices of my parents echoed in the corners, judging, questioning why I came back. Hadn’t I left them and this place behind a long time ago in my impatient rush to escape small town life? 

My kids burst in behind me, oohing and ahhing over the artifacts of my childhood. “You grew up here, dad? It’s so cool!” 

I smiled stiffly. Their delight eased the ache, if only for a moment. But this wasn’t my home, not really. I realized with sudden clarity that it never had been. I was just a temporary visitor who had overstayed my welcome. The ghosts that inhabited this place had finally succeeded in pushing me out, like a runt from a wolf pack. I should have listened to them sooner. I never really was welcome here...was I? It was time to leave, and not look back. My home was elsewhere now. The past was the past. I took one last look around, hugged my kids close, and headed out the door towards the light of the future.
