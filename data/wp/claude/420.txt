I awoke as the sun peeked through the shutters of my modest lodging in the village of Hamstead, just north of London. It was a spring morn like any other. As I rose to begin my daily routine, a knock came at the door. 

Upon opening it, a great cheer went up from a large crowd gathered before my home. “Happy Birthday, Timothy!” they exclaimed in unison. My name is not Timothy, I know not a soul among them, and ‘tis not even my birthday. 

A rather round man with a ruddy complexion stepped forward, extending his hand. “Well met, Timothy, old friend! ‘Tis a grand day to celebrate another year!” I stood dumbfounded, frozen in my doorway. The man's cheerful smile faded. “Come now, no need for the bashful act today of all days! We've come from all over to celebrate the merry occasion of your birth.”

I found my words at last and spoke softly. “Good sir, I apologize for the confusion, but I am not this Timothy you speak of. My name is Claude. ‘Tis not my birthday, and I'm afraid you have the wrong residence.”

The rotund man's face reddened further, this time from embarrassment rather than spirits. He turned to the waiting crowd. “My dear friends, I have made a grave error it seems. This is not the home of our dear Timothy after all.” A collective gasp went through the mass. Before a riot could emerge, I raised my voice.

“My good people, please remain calm. Though I share not in your friend Timothy's birthday, I bear you no ill will for this mistake.”  The ruddy man spoke again. “We offer our sincere apologies for disturbing your morning, sir.” The crowd behind him voiced their regret and began to disperse. 

The man offered his hand once more. “I am Thomas, and we are all dreadfully sorry to have intruded upon you.” I accepted his handshake. “No need for apologies, good Thomas. 'Twas an honest error that I take no offense at.”

Thomas smiled. “You are too kind, Mr. Claude. As a token of our regret, please accept this small cask of mead and these fifty pence to spend in the village as you like.” I began to protest but Thomas raised a hand. “We insist. 'Tis the least we can do for rousing you and likely ruining your morning meal.” I conceded and accepted the gifts with thanks. 

And so my uneventful morn took an unexpected turn into an amusing adventure. With the story and gifts to show for it, 'twas a morning not soon forgotten, though no birthday had occurred at all. I set off into the village to fill my belly, the sound of laughter and celebration still echoing down the lane.
