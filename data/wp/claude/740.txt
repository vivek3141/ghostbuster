The old warehouse creaked as Azrael descended from the rafters, his black wings folding behind him. He glanced around at the empty space, dimly lit by the moonlight filtering through dirty skylights. 

"I know you're here, Zadkiel. Come out and face me, you cowardly cherub." His voice echoed in the vast space.

A pure white light appeared and brightened until the figure of an angel emerged. Zadkiel hovered a few feet off the ground, his feathery white wings keeping him aloft. "Must you always be so dramatic, Azrael?" he sighed.

Azrael hissed, baring his fangs. "You've interfered for the last time, angel. Your do-gooding has disrupted my plans once too often. This ends now."

"I cannot stand by while you spread evil and corruption," Zadkiel replied calmly. "I act with grace and compassion, as is my purpose, granted by the Creator."

"Your purpose is to be a thorn in my side!" Azrael lunged at the angel, claws outstretched and ready to rend flesh from bone. 

Zadkiel dodged easily, Azrael's momentum carrying him past. "All beings have a divine purpose, even you, Demon!" He floated higher, keeping a wary eye on Azrael. "But your purpose seems to be to test humanity by providing temptation and darkness so they have a choice between good and evil."

Azrael roared, launching a blast of fire from his hands toward the angel. "My purpose is destruction and chaos!" 

The flames engulfed empty air as Zadkiel flitted aside.  "Destruction is a necessary part of creation. But chaos should not come at the cost of ethics and morality." His eyes glowed with holy power. "Your recent actions have caused nothing but pain and death, with no benefit. I cannot stand by and allow that to continue."

"Your choices are not for you to make, angel!" Azrael gathered his powers of shadow and fear. "Your time as a guardian of humanity is at an end!"

Azrael hurled the writhing shadows up at Zadkiel. The angel swooped low, releasing waves of golden light that dispelled the shadows on contact. 

The pair faced off again, ideological enemies trapped in an eternal stalemate of good versus evil. Their battle would continue as it always had, an embodiment of the universal clash between light and dark that fuels the cycle of morality. With a final glare of contempt, demon and angel both vanished from the warehouse to resume their ancient struggle someplace anew.
