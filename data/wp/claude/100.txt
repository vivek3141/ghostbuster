The Eve of the Redistribution 

Jenny sat in her small apartment, listening to the excited chatter from the streets below. Once every half century, the accumulated wealth of the entire world was randomly re-distributed. No one knew who would wake up rich or poor. Some loved the drama and uncertainty, throwing lavish parties on the eve of the redistribution. Others protested what they saw as a disruption of the natural order.

As a child, Jenny had found the redistribution thrilling, dreaming of the lavish lifestyle that might be hers if the odds were in her favor. But over the years, she had built a small but comfortable life for herself. She had a steady job, good friends, and enough for life's little pleasures. Wealth might bring more lavish pleasures, but also more problems and responsibilities. Jenny had grown content with what she had. 

A loud pop outside startled Jenny. She looked out to see fireworks lighting up the sky, the revelers' excitement reaching a fever pitch. Someone screamed with glee, no doubt fantasizing about the riches that might soon be theirs. 

Jenny smiled wistfully, remembering the time when she had felt the same way. But all any redistribution could change was the wrapping paper, not the gift inside. Happiness came from living a life surrounded by people who mattered, doing work that mattered. Lavish parties and grand mansions were fleeting diversions. 

As midnight approached, Jenny watched her neighbors frantically making last minute plans to optimize their odds, as if by doing so they might bend the universe to their will.  But tomorrow the world's wealth would scatter unpredictably, and life's true joys and sorrows would remain unchanged. 

When the clock struck midnight, Jenny whispered a wish into the chaos outside: “May fortune favor those who keep an open and grateful heart.” She knew that when morning came, as the new wealth settled over the world, happiness would still remain elusive for those grasping too tightly to hold onto it. But for others open to life's simple pleasures, the dawn would bring joy enough.
