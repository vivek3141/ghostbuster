The Last Light 

The control panel blinked in the dim light of the bunker. John entered the final authorization code with a heavy sigh. The last reactor faded into darkness, its hum fading into silence.

He was the last person left to turn out the lights. 

John climbed the stairs out of the bunker for the final time, sealing the heavy door behind him. He emerged into a silent, twilight world. The sprawling city skyline was now a field of cold, empty towers piercing a darkening sky.

His footsteps echoed as he walked down the abandoned street. Not a single light glowed in any window. The entire grid was dead, from the massive solar arrays in the desert to the oceanic turbines now grinding to a halt.

A pale moon began to rise as John left the city behind. He paused for a moment, taking in the pristine night sky for the first time in his life, a sky no longer stained by the glare of a civilization that now only existed as a memory held in the mind of the last man on Earth. 

With a heavy heart, he continued his lonely walk into the night, enveloped by a darkness at once ominous yet peaceful. The world may have gone dark, but in the glow of the moon and stars, there was still light to be found, even for those left alone to turn out the final lights of humanity's age.
