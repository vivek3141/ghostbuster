The Letter 

I stared at the crumpled piece of paper in my hands, reading and rereading the contents. My brow furrowed as I tried to make sense of what I was seeing.

It was a letter, apparently from myself, dated exactly one year in the future. But that was impossible. How could I be receiving a letter from myself in the future? 

I read through the short missive again:

Dear [My Name], 

I know this will sound strange, but I am writing to you from one year in the future. I have some instructions for you—some very specific things you need to do today in order to ensure certain events unfold as they should. I can't explain why, but trust that following these instructions is of the utmost importance. 

Here is what you must do today:

1. Visit the corner coffee shop at 9:32 am. Order a double espresso and a blueberry muffin. Sit at the table closest to the wall by the front window. 

2.Take a cab to the library at 11:46 am. Check out books B341 in the fiction section, R732 in self-help, and M621 in the travel section. Read chapters 2, 5 and 8 from each book in that order. Return the books by 6 pm.

3.Visit the park near your house at precisely 7:42 pm. Bring some bread to feed the ducks. An important meeting will happen here—wait on the east side of the duck pond until you speak with a woman walking a beagle. You must speak with her, or events will not unfold as they should. 

Do these things today without fail. The future depends on it.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]

I had to laugh at the absurdity, even as a cold feeling of dread settled in my stomach. It seemed implausible that I had really received a letter from my future self. But how else to explain its existence? 

I knew time travel was impossible...and yet, here was a direct message, in my own handwriting, from a year in the future, giving me a set of oddly specific instructions to follow.  There were no explanations as to why I should follow the instructions or what outcome they would lead to.

My curiosity struggled with my skepticism as I tried to decide what to do. Follow the bizarre list of instructions from my 'future self' or dismiss the letter as some kind of prank? The scales tipped back and forth as I wavered in indecision. Finally, my curiosity won out—I had to know what would happen if I followed the instructions. I decided I would follow along for now, while remaining wary of some unseen trickster. 

At 9:32 am, I walked into my local coffee shop, ordered a double espresso and a blueberry muffin, and sat down at the table specified in the letter. And there my journey into the strange mystery from the future began...
