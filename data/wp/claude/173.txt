I smiled as Jim approached me with his usual greeting. "I see my assassins have failed again!" he said with a laugh. I chuckled along, as I always did. Jim had an odd sense of humor and this was one of his recurring jokes. 

We had been friends for over a decade, meeting as coworkers at the local big box store. Jim was a cashier and I worked in the electronics department. We had bonded over long shifts, annoying customers, and hiding from our obnoxious manager. Even after I had moved on to a job in my field of study, Jim and I had remained close. We met up for beers a couple times a month to catch up.

Jim's joke had started a couple years ago. The first time he had said it, I had been slightly alarmed before realizing he was just kidding around. Now it was routine. Assassins, I thought with an internal eye roll and shake of my head. My friend had a strange sense of humor. 

A few months later, I was home alone watching TV when I thought I heard a noise outside. I muted the TV and listened but didn't hear anything else. An hour later, just as I was about to head to bed, I heard another noise. This time it was clearly the sound of footsteps on my front walkway. My chest tightened, but I told myself it was probably just a neighbor walking by. 

The next morning, I opened my front door to get the newspaper and stopped in my tracks. There was a knife sticking out of the door at eye level, pinning a note in place. In uneven, menacing letters, the note read “The next one won’t miss.”

My mind reeled. Surely this had to be some kind of sick joke. But who would do something like this? A chill ran down my spine as I suddenly remembered Jim's frequent greeting. Assassins.  I grabbed my phone and called Jim, expecting to hear his usual friendly, joking demeanor.

Instead, he sounded wary. “Hello?”

“Jim, did you put a knife in my door?” I asked bluntly. My heart pounded as I waited for a response. Please let this be a joke in very poor taste.

Jim sighed. “Look, man, I’m really sorry. I should never have started with that stupid joke. The truth is, I'm in deep with some bad people. I owe them a lot of money. When I couldn't pay, they told me to take you out instead. I thought I could get away with just pretending in front of them but not actually doing it. I never thought they'd send someone else.”  

I was stunned into silence, my mind racing to make sense of his words. Deep with bad people? Owe them money? Take you out? 

“I'm so sorry,” Jim repeated miserably. “I understand if you hate me. I just wanted to come clean. And warn you. These aren't the kind of people you want to mess with. Watch your back.” There was a click as he hung up the phone. 

I stood in shock, still gripping the knife pinning the note to my door. My longtime friend, the harmless cashier with the offbeat sense of humor, had hired assassins to kill me. And suddenly his "joke" didn't seem very funny anymore.
