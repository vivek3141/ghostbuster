Jenny was excited for her 10th birthday, not for the presents or cake, but because it was the day she would be assigned her companion animal. All the children in the village waited eagerly for their 10th birthdays and the chance to get their lifelong animal friend.  

Jenny loved animals and was hoping for something fun like a puppy that she could play with. Her parents tried to temper her expectations, reminding her that she would get whatever animal was deemed appropriate by the Matchers. The Matchers were the mysterious figures that observed children and paired them with the companion animal that best fit the child's spirit and personality.

On the morning of her birthday, Jenny woke up early and did her chores, trying to show what a responsible almost-10-year-old she was. In the afternoon, she walked to the Matcher's hut with her parents. 

The Matcher, a kindly old woman, greeted Jenny with a smile. "I have been observing you for some time, young one, and I think I have an appropriate match for your spirit." The Matcher whistled and a small creature flew in through an open window, landing softly on the floor. It was a beautiful blue jay.

Jenny was stunned into silence. A blue jay? She had hoped for something she could hug and cuddle. The blue jay tilted its head and regarded her with one beady eye.

Seeing Jenny's disappointed face, the Matcher said gently, "I know this is not what you expected, but this blue jay's spirit matches your own - clever, quick to learn, and sometimes impatient." 

Jenny's eyes filled with tears as she realized the Matcher was right. She often got bored easily and sometimes spoke out of turn. Her parents had frequently scolded her for chattering endlessly.

The Matcher handed Jenny a book about caring for blue jays. "Give it time," she said. "I think you'll find you have more in common with this lively creature than you expect."

Jenny named the blue jay "Chatter" and though their start was rocky, they soon became the best of friends. Chatter turned out to be a playful and affectionate pet, and helped Jenny learn patience and when to hold her tongue. Jenny was grateful the Matcher had seen her true spirit where she herself had not. She and Chatter would remain lifelong companions, learning and growing together through all of Jenny's days.
