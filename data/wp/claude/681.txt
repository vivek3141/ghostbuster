The old warehouse loomed over Jenny as she walked up to the heavy metal door. Her heart was pounding. She had trained for over a year for this day, the final test to join the Agency. Only one in a hundred candidates made it this far. 

She knocked on the door using the pattern she had memorized. The door swung open with a creak. A figure in a black coat and hat gestured for her to come in.

The room inside was dark except for a single lightbulb. Under the harsh light were three chairs, two occupied by figures dressed like the one who had greeted her. Their faces were obscured by their hats.

The proctor spoke. "Take a seat. Your final test begins now. In front of you, you will find three glasses of clear liquid. One is water. One is a tasteless, odorless poison that will cause paralysis in under a minute. The other is a fast-acting hallucinogen. You have one minute to determine which is which and drink one, or you fail. Begin."

Jenny's heart seized in her chest. This couldn't be real. They couldn't really expect her to risk poison. She looked at the three innocuous glasses on the table, trying to find any clues. There were none. She could see no way to determine their contents. 

The proctor announced, "30 seconds remaining."

Jenny began to panic. Failure meant the end of over a year of grueling training and sacrifice. All her dreams of joining the Agency would be gone. 

A realization dawned on her. Her breathing slowed. Her panic subsided, replaced by a calm certainty.

"10 seconds."

She looked straight at the proctor. "I will not drink from these glasses. It would be foolish and could cost me my life. No test is worth that." 

The proctor was silent. The two other figures stirred. Jenny held her breath.

After an agonizing pause, the proctor replied, "Well done. You have passed the final test."

The two other figures removed their hats. Her instructors. They congratulated her and shook her hand. 

Jenny was in shock. "I passed? But I refused to drink." 

The proctor replied, "Exactly. You demonstrated unwillingness to obey unreasonable orders and valued your own safety. That is what we were looking for. Discretion and independent, critical thinking are indispensable in the field."  

"The hallucinogen was just water. We would never give you poison. But you had no way of knowing that." Her field instructor smiled.

Jenny shook her head, laughing with relief and disbelief.  In order to pass the test, you must fail. She had done exactly that, failing to obey the orders, and had passed with flying colors. Her new life as an agent was about to begin.
