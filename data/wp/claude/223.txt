I woke with a start. The ability to time travel came to me suddenly, unexpectedly. One moment I was asleep in my bed, the next my consciousness had jumped 3 hours into the future.

At first I thought it was a dream. But then it happened again. And again. I realized with a mixture of wonder and fear that I had acquired the ability to move through time at will. 

Yet I remained trapped in the same physical space. I could jump to any point in the past or future, but would remain stuck in my bedroom.

I decided to keep this ability a secret. Who would believe me anyway? I conducted small experiments, jumping a few minutes or hours at a time, observing how the light changed through my window, seeing and hearing my family move about the house.

One day I grew bold and jumped ahead 50 years. My house was different but familiar. Where was my family? Just then there was a knock at the door of my bedroom. A middle-aged man entered—it was an older version of my son! I nearly cried out in shock, but caught myself. Of course, to him I didn’t exist in this time period at all. 

I began to realize the limitations of my ability. I was a passive observer of the lives of my loved ones, unable to truly interact or share experiences with them. I was trapped in a prison of the present, one inescapable moment, even as time flowed and changed around me.

In a moment of anguish, I craved release from this ability. I focused with all my mental might on returning to the normal flow of time. When I opened my eyes, I saw daylight filtering through my window—it was morning, and I had returned. My strange ability had disappeared as suddenly as it arrived. I breathed a sigh of relief, overjoyed at my liberation and newfound appreciation for the simple progression of moments in a life truly lived. My adventure in time had come to an end.
