Jenny was puzzled by the instructions in the ancient spell book. "To conjure a fireball, beatbox: boots, cats, boots, cats." What did that even mean?

She asked her friend Mark, who loved music. "It's a vocal percussion technique, " he explained. "You make drum sounds with your mouth, like 'boots' and 'cats' to create a beat."

Jenny practiced the "boots and cats" beat. She felt silly but kept at it. On her fifth attempt, a burst of flame erupted from her fingertips, singing the curtains.  She yelped, batting out the fire. Magic was real! But how bizarre that it required beatboxing.

During magic class, their teacher, Mr. Willowby, demonstrated the levitation spell. "Repeat after me: boots, cats, boots, cats, snakes, snakes." The class beatboxed, and Mr. Willowby floated up, crossed his legs, and took a sip of tea. 

"Your turn," he said, as the class stared in shock. Most students couldn't get past "boots and cats" without laughing.  But with practice, one by one, each student beatboxed their way into the air.

Jenny stayed late to practice every spell she could find. She beatboxed her way through cleaning charms, truth spells, and even an invisibility enchantment.  She wondered if ancient magicians were also skilled beatboxers.  By the time she got home, her mouth was exhausted.  But her heart swelled, thinking of the magical world she was now a part of - all thanks to her newfound beatboxing skills.
