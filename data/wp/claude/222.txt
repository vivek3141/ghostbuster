God's latest literary effort, Bible: The Newest Testament- Confusions Resolved, Mistakes Corrected, is a bold attempt to clarify and update the somewhat outdated and contradictory messages from his earlier works. 

The new testament seeks to resolve some of the long-standing debates around interpretation of God's words. For instance, God unambiguously states that homosexuality is perfectly acceptable and people of all sexual orientations and gender identities will be welcomed into heaven. He apologizes for the confusion from some of his earlier followers on this issue. God also clarifies that hell does not actually exist - it was just a metaphor used to scare people into good behavior. All souls will eventually ascend to heaven.

God spends a good portion of this latest installment emphasizing the primacy of love, compassion and kindness above all else. He regrets previous messages that seemed to encourage violence, misogyny and close-mindedness at certain points. The new testament makes clear that all ethical actions should stem from a place of love, empathy and understanding.

The new work does have some continuity with the classic Bible, carrying over the Ten Commandments and Jesus' message of loving your neighbor.  However, the fire and brimstone are gone, replaced with a God who is all-loving, radically inclusive and unwilling to condemn any of his creations. Overall, this new installment delivers a view of God and ethics that seem tailor-made for the 21st century.

Some may miss the poetic language and epic sweep of the original Bible. But most readers will find this a welcome improvement, helping to reconcile faith with modern moral sensibilities. God is likely to win back some lapsed followers with this latest effort. This God is loving, progressive and ready to clarify what he really meant to say. The "newest testament" deserves praise for resolving the many confusions and mistakes that had come before. Faith and reason finally meet.
