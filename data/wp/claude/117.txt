The Island of Fire  

The waves crashed against the bow as Captain Jack peered through his spyglass. In the distance, a volcanic island rose from the sea, smoke and flame erupting from its peak. 

"There be dragons on that isle, captain," said his first mate Sully. "And not just the fire-breathing kind. Legend says three warrior women guard the dragons' gold."

Jack grinned, flashing a gold tooth. "Then we best be extra charming. Drop the anchor and lower the boats!"

They rowed ashore and trekked into the jungle. Massive reptilian footprints crushed plants underfoot. Two yellow eyes peered from the brush, then vanished.

They emerged onto a rocky beach circled by sheer cliffs. But no dragons or warriors in sight. 

"Spread out, ye scurvy dogs, and start diggin'!" Jack bellowed. 

His men had only begun to dig when a sharp blade pressed against Jack's neck. He turned to see a woman with fiery red hair, eyes blazing. "Who dares disturb our shores?" she demanded. 

"Captain Jack, treasure hunter, at your service, m'lady," he said with an elaborate bow. 

She snorted. "I am Maeve. Behind you stand my sisters, Aife and Siobhan. What do you seek, Captain?" 

"Naught but treasure, fair lady. We wish no trouble."

Maeve laughed. "You'll find no treasure here. Now be gone!" She whistled, and the ground shook as three dragons landed with a roar, fangs gleaming.

Jack eyed the dragons and the sharp blades wielded by the warrior women. He grinned at Maeve. "Perchance we could strike a bargain?"  

Maeve stepped close, blade at his cheek, and smiled coyly. "You have nothing we want, Captain. Now leave, before my pets get...hungry."

Jack sighed, then yelled, "Back to the ship, ye bilge rats! We've no treasure here today!"

As they rowed away, Jack doffed his hat to the island. The warriors had won this round. But he'd be back. There was always treasure to be found, for those daring enough to face dragons and warrior women alike.
