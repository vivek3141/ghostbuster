I don't want to cut off his head, but I don't really have a choice. I close my eyes and just wait for it to be over. My insides turn as I feel the swing connect. 

There is a sickening thud as the axe hits home. The crowd gathered in the square cheers wildly. I open my eyes and look down at the wooden block in front of me, the severed head of the once mighty warlord Taragon staring blankly back. His eyes are still open in a final act of defiance. Even in death, he refuses to show an ounce of fear or submission.

I turn away from the gruesome sight and walk back into the castle, handing my axe to the guard at the entrance. My limbs feel like lead, my stomach churning. I've killed before in battle, but never like this. This felt deeply wrong, like a perversion of justice. 

Taragon was a brutal leader, but he was still a man. He deserved to die in combat with a sword in his hand, not kneeling helpless on the executioner's block after a sham of a trial. But the King demanded his head, and his word is law. My duty as captain of the guard is to carry out his orders, no matter my own feelings.

The King's advisor, Lord Arkon, is waiting for me in the hall, a smug smile on his face. "Well done, captain. The King will be most pleased. Come, we must tell him the good news at once!"

I follow Arkon to the King's chambers, my heavy heart sinking with every step. King Mathis looks up from his desk expectantly as we enter. "It is done, Your Grace. The traitor Taragon has been executed, as you commanded."

The King's eyes gleam with a fanatical light. For a moment, my blood runs cold. The man I have sworn to serve has changed much since Queen Rosalind's death. Her kind and steady presence had always balanced out the King's severity. Now there is a hardness to him, a cruelty even, that I do not recognize.

"Good, good!" the King exclaims. "His death will serve as an example to any who might defy me. You have done well, captain. Leave us now. I wish to speak with Lord Arkon alone."

I bow stiffly and leave the room, Arkon's sly chuckle following me out. A feeling of foreboding settles in my chest as I walk away. The King is changing, and not for the better. I fear this is only the beginning of the darkness yet to come. And I worry my axe may taste blood once again before the end.
