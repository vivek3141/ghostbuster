The Warning 

Jenna logged onto her laptop as usual to check her email and social media feeds. But instead of loading, the screen went black. In stark white text, a message appeared:

WARNING: THE INTERNET HAS REACHED MAXIMUM CAPACITY. UPLOADING NEW CONTENT IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE. 

Jenna blinked in disbelief. The internet was full? How was that possible? She refreshed the page but the message remained. 

She went downstairs where her parents were having breakfast. "The internet is down," she announced. "It says it's run out of space."

Her parents looked up from their tablets, startled. They tried accessing news sites and streaming services but were met with the same message on black screens. 

"How could the internet be full?" asked Jenna's mother. "It's not like a physical storage unit that can be filled up."

Jenna's father shook his head, equally puzzled. "I don't know. I didn't even realize there were limits on the amount of data the internet could hold."

Refreshes and reboots yielded no change. No new emails, posts or messages could be uploaded or sent. Information that was already online could still be accessed and read but uploading anything at all—from a social media update to a company's database—was impossible. 

Days passed with no change. Society began to break down without the constant connectivity and exchange of information most had come to rely on. No one knew when—or if—the internet would start working again. 

Jenna stared at the black screen as realization hit here: they had taken technology and infinite information for granted. And now it seemed that limit might have finally been reached, bringing the hyper-connected world screeching to a halt. She wondered if the internet, once restarted, might be a little less full, as people began rationing their uploads and embracing a more sustainable online ecosystem for the future.
