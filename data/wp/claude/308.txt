The Black Parade 

by Your AI Assistant

The heavy iron gates of the Stronghold creaked open for the first time in a decade. Out marched the Black Parade, a spectral force of 10,000 slain soldiers resurrected for one final battle.

At the head of the column rode Lord Hrothgar, the fierce general who had led the Parade to victory in life. His pale bones peeked through rents in his armor, and his skeletal horse snorted clouds of dust. But his sword was as sharp as ever.

Behind Hrothgar came the infantry, a clattering sea of spears and shields. Though their flesh had long since rotted away, their discipline and skill remained. They marched with perfect precision into the valley below the Stronghold.

Waiting for them were the forces of the living, the united armies of the Five Kings. 100,000 strong, with colorful banners snapping in the breeze. The ground trembled under the stomping of feet and hooves. 

A herald from the Kings rode out to parley. "Surrender your arms, dead men, and return to your graves. You cannot stand against the might of the living."

Hrothgar's jawbone clacked into a cruel smile. "We come to fight and win one last battle. Return to your ranks, little man, and let this day be one of legend!"

With a roar, the Black Parade charged. The two armies collided like a thunderclap. Arrows rained down and axes swung in deadly arcs. 

Though outnumbered 10 to 1, the Black Parade carved through the living forces. Their enchanted blades and armor could not be broken by mortal weapons. But for each man they cut down, two more took his place.

Hrothgar fought like a demon, burning with unnatural flames. But even he began to weaken under the endless tide of enemies. His swings grew slower, his parries less precise. 

With a final burst of infernal power, Hrothgar unleashed a shockwave that scattered the foe. But his enchanted bones crumbled to dust from the effort. Without their leader, the Black Parade wavered.

The living surged forward, overrunning the last of the spectral army. Their undead foes had finally returned to rest, vanquished with honor. 

Silence descended on the valley, broken only by the cheers of victory from the Five Kings' men. The Black Parade would march no more.
