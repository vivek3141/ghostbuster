I woke with a start, the remnants of a strange dream fading as my eyes fluttered open. But my room wasn't empty. At the foot of my bed stood a figure in a sharp black suit, his red skin glowing faintly, two small horns protruding from his forehead. The Devil.

We locked eyes for a moment and a chill ran down my spine. His gaze burrowed into my soul, seeing all my secrets and sins. He knew everything about me. 

A sly smile spread across his face. He tapped the bottom of my foot with a long, bony finger and uttered two words: "You're it."

His body disintegrated into smoke and flame, leaving behind the smell of sulphur. The room was empty once more.

I sat in stunned silence, wondering if I was still dreaming. But the fading warmth on the sole of my foot told me otherwise. This was real. The Devil had visited me for reasons unknown and made me "it". But what did that mean?

A knot of dread and panic built in my stomach as possibilities paraded through my mind. Was I now cursed? Condemned? Had my soul been marked for Hell? 

I shook off the echoes of the dream and checked the time - I was late for work. Throwing on clothes, I tried to push the strange encounter from my mind. But all day it lingered in the background, its implications hanging over me like a sword waiting to fall.

The Devil had paid me a visit for some sinister purpose I couldn't yet fathom. I was now "it" for his demented game, though I didn't know the rules or how to stop playing. All I knew was that my life had irrevocably changed in that single moment I woke to find the Devil at the foot of my bed.
