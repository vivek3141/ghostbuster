If I keep this up, my life will fall apart. That was the thought that crept into Mark's mind as he glanced at the clock on his desk. 2:43 am. He had been working for nearly 20 hours straight trying to meet the insane deadline his boss had imposed for the Henderson account.  

His eyes burned from staring at the computer screen for so long. His back ached from hunching over in his chair. He couldn't remember the last time he ate. The coffee cups strewn about his desk were empty, matching the hollow pit in his stomach. 

Mark knew this pace wasn't sustainable. His health was suffering. His relationships were fraying. He barely saw his kids this week and he couldn't remember the last meaningful conversation he had with his wife. At this rate, his life expectancy might be cut short within the year. 

But what choice did he have? He had to meet these deadlines to keep his job. And this job paid for everything—the big house, the nice cars, his kids' private school.  Without this job, his carefully constructed life would collapse like a house of cards. 

As he proceeded to chug another cup of bitter, lukewarm coffee, Mark started to seriously consider making a change. This couldn't go on. There had to be another way.  Maybe he could push back on the unrealistic deadlines. Maybe he could have an honest conversation with his boss about work-life balance. Or maybe it was time to dust off his resume and start looking for a role at a company with a more human approach.

The thought of upending his stable career path was frightening. But not as frightening as dropping dead at the age of 45 from the accumulated stress.  As Mark finally powered down his computer for the night and wearily dragged himself to bed, he resolved to make a change. If he didn't, his life—or what was left of it—would fall apart. The time for a new beginning was now. His life depended on it.
