The massive protests in Jerusalem intensified today as controversial religious leader Jesus of Nazareth was arrested on charges of blasphemy and sedition. Thousands of his followers clashed with police as he was taken into custody last night. 

Jesus has gained fame in recent years for his unorthodox teachings and supposed miraculous acts. He has amassed a large grassroots following, especially among the poor and marginalized. However, he has also drawn the ire of religious leaders and politicians for his radical message of social and spiritual revolution. They accuse him of threatening the established order and traditions.

After a controversial visit to Jerusalem for the Passover festival, Jesus was betrayed by one of his own disciples. Authorities arrested him in the Garden of Gethsemane late Thursday evening without incident. However, when news of his arrest spread, mass protests erupted. Crowds blocked streets and threw stones at police chanting "Free Jesus now!" Police resorted to tear gas and water cannons to disperse the crowds, resulting in dozens of injuries.

At a hastily arranged trial before the High Priest Caiaphas, Jesus was found guilty of blasphemy for claiming to be the Son of God. Under pressure from religious leaders, politicians sentenced him to death by crucifixion - an especially cruel form of execution used by the Romans to punish dissenters. 

As Jesus dragged the cross through the streets of Jerusalem and up to the hill of Calvary, his followers wept and protested. Even as he was being nailed to the cross, Jesus begged for their forgiveness. "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do," he said. After six hours of suffering, Jesus died from blood loss, exposure and a pierced heart.

In the aftermath of Jesus' death, his followers reported some extraordinary events. There were claims that the curtain in the great Temple was torn in two and darkness covered the land for several hours. Most shockingly, some women reported finding Jesus' tomb empty three days after the burial, claiming an angel told them he had risen from the dead. 

The conflicting accounts of these alleged "miracles" have ignited debate over what really happened. Religious leaders accuse Jesus' disciples of stealing the body to perpetrate a hoax. However, his followers insist Jesus truly conquered death as he had prophesied. The events in Jerusalem remain hotly contested and have intensified the call for political and social reforms in the region. Whatever the truth may be, it seems the Jesus movement has only just begun.
