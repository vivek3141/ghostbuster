The Discovery

She found the old dusty book in the back of the library. Blowing off the layers of neglect, she opened to a random page. There in precise cramped print was a short entry, just 100 words. 

Intrigued, she read it. A whole tiny tale in a few short lines. Her heart swelled and broke for the characters in those few sentences. How could so brief a work stir her emotions so?

She needed to know more. She read another, then another. Each a small gem, a fleeting glimpse into a life or world now gone. Yet vibrant and bursting still with wit or pathos or poignancy. 

A forgotten art form hidden in plain sight, a drabble. She devoured the whole book that day. A life's work, a lost world resurrected, distilled into moments of beauty trapped in amber,each exactly 100 words, no more, no less. 

She knew now what she wanted to do. She would bring this art form back to life. Share it with others. Write her own drabbles. Tiny tales to break the heart and lift the spirit. All in just 100 words. Not one more, and not one less. The constrained extravagance of the drabble form called to her. The challenge, the journey of discovery, just beginning. Her world would never be the same again.
