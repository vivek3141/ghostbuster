I was young and foolish at 15, caught up in the whirlwind of first love. When I told Jennifer I would always be there for her, I meant it with the sincerity that only a teenager could muster. Little did I know that my earnest promise would be taken literally by forces outside my control.  

Aphrodite, the goddess of love, must have been watching over us that night. She heard my pledge and granted me the power to sense whenever Jennifer was in distress or danger, and appear instantly by her side. At first, it seemed romantic, like something out of a fairy tale. I would show up out of thin air and comfort Jennifer when she was sad or scared, like a knight in shining armor. She was delighted by my new ability, and it only strengthened our fledgling relationship—for a few weeks, at least.

The magic wore off quickly, as so often happens when you're young. Jennifer and I drifted apart and the relationship ended, as most teen romances do. I figured the strange new power I had gained would disappear with it. I was wrong. Over the next decade, as Jennifer and I lived our separate lives, I continued to be summoned to her side whenever she was upset or in need of help. It didn't seem to matter that we were no longer a couple—or even friends. I was compelled to come to her aid, often at the most inopportune times.

More than once I found myself teleporting to Jennifer's side in the middle of an important work meeting, or while on a date with someone new. Trying to explain my sudden disappearances and reappearances was irritating at best, and seriously hampered my ability to move on from that first romance. Jennifer and I had both long since married other people, but still I continued to pop into her life—often startling her husband and children—whenever she felt distressed. 

Ten years after that promise of eternal devotion, I bitterly regretted making such a rash vow. But the goddess had granted my wish, and I was still chained to that fleeting teenage romance and the girl I thought I would always love. My life had moved on, but a part of me would forever remain always there for Jennifer—whether either of us wanted it or not.
