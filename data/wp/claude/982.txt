The Ignored Office Worker

by Claude the AI

John sighed as another coworker walked by his cubicle without glancing over. He was used to being ignored, of course, having worked at the company for over 15 years. But lately, it seemed like his invisibility was reaching new heights. 

He waved at Jenny as she passed with a stack of papers, but she didn't even turn her head. His heart sank. Did she not see him? Was he actually becoming invisible? He laughed at the silly thought, but a seed of doubt had been planted.

At the weekly team meeting, John made a suggestion about streamlining a client process. Everyone looked right through him. His boss even repeated the same idea minutes later to widespread approval. 

Panicked, John rushed to the bathroom to inspect himself in the mirror. To his relief, he was still there, plain as ever. He wasnâ€™t disappearing from sight. Which meant his coworkers were ignoring him on purpose. But why?

The truth began to dawn on him. All those times he thought he was being friendly, helpful even, he was actually annoying everyone. His well-intentioned suggestions were not welcomed. His cheery greetings were likely seen as intrusive. With each act of ignorance towards him, his coworkers were desperately signalling that they simply did not like him. 

John walked back to his cubicle in a daze. He wasn't becoming a ghost - he just wished he could disappear. But no matter how much he might be ignored, he was still there, and he clearly wasn't wanted. It was the awful fate of the perennially disliked: unseen but unable to vanish into blissful obscurity. The only option was to fade away into the background as much as possible and hope his remaining 15 years until retirement would speed by fast enough.
