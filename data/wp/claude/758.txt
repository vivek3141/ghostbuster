I blinked awake as my watch beeped, showing 5:01 AM. Impossible. Everyone knows humans are designed to be unable to wake up during the dead hour from 5 to 6 AM, except for military personnel. 

A message flashed across my vision: "Report to your local military base. Basic training begins now."

Panic seared through me. I wasn't military. I was an accountant, for crying out loud. But my legs were already swinging out of bed and marching me out of the apartment.

The streets were empty except for a few dazed civilians being herded by soldiers. We were all converging on the military base, following orders we didn't understand.

At the gate, an officer scanned my ID and barked, "You've been conscripted. Follow the yellow line to the training facility."

Conscripted? My mind reeled as I followed the line into a nondescript concrete building. 

Inside, a man in uniform stood in front of a group of twenty civilians. "You have all demonstrated the ability to wake during the dead hour," he announced. "This makes you prime candidates to join the military's Dead Hour Division. You will defend the city from what awakens during this hidden sixtieth minute."

We were trained and armed within the hour. At 5:59, the order came to deploy around the outskirts of the city. Adrenaline spiked through my veins as the hour changed to 6 AM.

The attacks began at once. Creatures of darkness emerged from hidden portals, snarling and snapping. The Dead Hour Division fought back, guarding the city until 6:01 arrived and the creatures vanished, the portals closed. 

My training had awakened something in me I never knew existed. I was part of a secret army now, protecting humanity from the monsters they never saw. My old life was over, but my new purpose had just begun. I had survived my first dead hour. Many more would follow.
