The alarm blared at precisely 6 AM. Jenny rolled out of bed and put on her jogging clothes. Time for her morning run. 

As she laced up her shoes, her handler's voice came through the speaker in the ceiling. "Good morning, JC451. Your target today is the Goodwill on Broad and 3rd. Create a diversion and draw attention. The news cycle has been slow this week and ratings are down."

"Understood," Jenny replied. She didn't know why she had been born and bred to cause mayhem, but she didn't question her purpose. She just fulfilled the tasks she was given.

Jenny arrived at the Goodwill and made her way to the clothing section. After ensuring no one was watching, she pulled out a lighter and lit the sleeve of a wool coat on fire. Within seconds flames erupted, triggering the fire alarm and sprinklers. People screamed and ran out of the building.  

Sirens wailed in the distance as Jenny slipped away unnoticed. She checked her watch - 7:13 AM. Mission accomplished, right on schedule. The news channels would have an exciting story to air today, and her handler would reward her for another successful diversion. It was just another day's work for a burner.
