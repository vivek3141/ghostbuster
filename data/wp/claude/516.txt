The morning sun filtered through the blinds as I sipped my coffee and checked my phone. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a strange distortion in the air in the middle of my kitchen. Before I could comprehend what was happening, a wormhole opened with a pop and a figure tumbled out onto my tile floor. 

I jumped back, nearly dropping my mug. The figure was a woman, wearing thick wool clothing and  a long skirt. She slowly got to her feet, staring around the kitchen in utter bewilderment.

We stood there for a long moment, frozen in place, staring at each other. I found my voice first. "Who...who are you?"

She curtsied clumsily. "Abigail. I seem to have... fallen through some manner of portal. Where am I? And what is this strange place?" Her accent was thick, almost unintelligible. 

I blinked. "I'm afraid you've traveled through time. This is my kitchen, in the 21st century."  

Her eyes widened. "Time travel? Impossible!"

Just then, the wormhole popped loudly again and vanished. Abigail gasped. She rushed to the spot where it had been, grasping at empty air.

"I must return! My family will be worried sick. You must help me back through at once!" Her voice was shrill with panic.

"I'm sorry, I have no idea how that wormhole opened or how to reopen it. You seem to be stuck here." I tried to speak gently.  

Abigail slumped into a chair, head in her hands. I refilled my coffee and made her a cup of strong tea. It was going to be a long day of trying to explain the modern world to a visitor from centuries past, and I had no idea where to even begin. But for now, a warm drink and some comfort seemed the best place to start. I promised Abigail I would do whatever I could to help her adapt to this strange new world she found herself in.
