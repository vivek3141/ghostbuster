The grey walls of my cell have been my world for as long as I can remember. I was incarcerated as a young man, sentenced to life for a crime of passion in my youth. At the time, the world still had a few prisons left, holding onto the last dregs of humanity deemed unfit for society. 

Over the decades, the crime rate dropped steadily worldwide. Wars ended. Poverty was eradicated. Advancements in healthcare, automation, and renewable energy unleashed a wave of prosperity and contentment across the globe. As people's basic needs were met and jobs became scarce, the motivations for crime faded. 

One by one, prisons closed down. Guards found new vocations, inmates were released and rehabilitated. Until only a few cells remained in this crumbling fortress, holding those few with the harshest sentences for the direst crimes. Then it was just me.

My only visitor is an automaton, delivering meals and tidying my cell. The warden long ago retired when he realized I was content to see out my days here. There was no risk of escape. Where would I go in this foreign world I no longer understand?

Through a slit of a window, I sometimes see transport vehicles whizzing by, hear the distant sounds of a bustling city. But in here, time stands still. My hair has turned grey and memories have grown hazy. The world has changed in unimaginable ways, leaving me behind like a relic of a dark history no one cares to remember.

I often wonder why they keep me here still. My crime was heinous but so long ago. Am I an odd museum piece, a curiosity of humanity's savage past on display? Or am I forgotten, an oversight in a system so streamlined it has no room for the human inside? 

Either way I know these walls will be my tomb. The last prisoner in a world without crime, trapped in a prison without purpose, alone until the end of his unnatural days. All I can hope for is a just and merciful end for a man out of time, paying eternally for a single moment of madness so many lifetimes ago. This is my legacy: to be the last man in the last cell in the last prison on the planet.
