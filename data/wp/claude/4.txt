The familiar sounds of the morning show hosts chattering away on the TV blended into an indiscernible hum as my eyes grew heavy. I had been aimlessly flipping through channels for the last hour, not quite ready to start my day but unable to fall back asleep. There's a magical moment between wakefulness and sleep, a moment where noise seems to reach a crescendo but everything is so calm right as you crash into the warm waves of sleep.  

As my eyes closed the only thing I saw was the time on the TV screen in front of me, faded blue numbers that read 10:34AM. For a split second panic arose in me, worried I had overslept and missed my morning meetings, before the realization came that it was Saturday. Relief washed over me as I gave in to the heaviness of my eyelids and drifted off.

In that place between waking and dreaming, memories and imagined scenes blended together into a nonsensical stream of consciousness. Flashes of last night's dinner mixed with old childhood friends long unseen. Logic and time seemed to stand still here where anything felt possible. 

The shrill ringing of my phone shattered the fragile peace, yanking me abruptly into the waking world once again. I fumbled around on the coffee table, my eyes still not fully open, and grabbed the buzzing phone. "Hello?" I mumbled, my mouth not yet caught up with my mind.

"Hey, were you still sleeping?" my friend Jenny's voice came through, layered with judgement. I felt around for a clock, remembering the time I last saw displayed on the TV, and realizing over an hour and a half had passed in what felt like mere minutes. 

"No, just resting my eyes for a bit," I lied, not ready to admit I had slept most of the morning away. The magical space between sleep and wakefulness always seemed to distort my perception of time passing.

 "Well I was hoping you'd want to grab lunch today if you're free," she said. I rubbed the last remnants of sleep from my eyes and stifled a yawn. While more rest still called to me, I knew once I was up and moving the tiredness would fade. 

"Yea, lunch sounds great. I'll hop in the shower and meet you downtown in an hour?" I offered.

"Perfect, see you then!" she replied and the phone clicked off. I stretched out my arms above my head and took a deep, rejuvenating breath. While that magical space between wake and sleep was pleasant, being firmly rooted in the waking world had its benefits too. I got up and headed for the shower, the memories of my dreams and any last clinging fatigue washed away in the steady stream of water. Today felt full of possibilities.
