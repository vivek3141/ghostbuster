I scanned the sea of young, eager faces in the college auditorium. "Who here has been in an aDAM attack?" I asked. A few hesitant hands went up. I nodded, unsurprised. The attacks were rare, thankfully, but still far too common.  

I took a deep breath. "My name is Jenny. When I was 18, my city was hit by an aDAM attack. Artificially Designed Adversarial Microbes, for those unfamiliar. Tiny robots, invisible to the naked eye, designed to swarm in, overwhelm systems, and wreak havoc. In my case, they targeted the water supply."

A hush fell over the crowd. I continued, "The first sign was the water turning an odd pale green color. Then people started getting sick. My family, my neighbors, entire blocks of the city. The microbes were malicious, hard to trace, and seemed to mutate constantly to evade detection."  

"I saw my baby sister die first. Then my mother. My father held on the longest, fighting for months in the hospital before the endless infections and organ failures overtook him." My voice caught, and I took another steadying breath. "Sorry. It's still hard to talk about, even after all these years."

A hand went up. "How did the attacks finally stop?" a student asked softly. 

"Brilliant scientists worked around the clock to develop a targeted antiviral," I said. "It took 6 months of nonstop work, but they did it. By the time the cure was distributed, over 10,000 people in my city had died. But it could have been worse, so much worse, if those scientists hadn't achieved what they did." 

I gazed out at the silent audience. "That's why I'm here today. To remind you how precious life is, how fragile. How we must dedicate our lives to knowledge and discovery, progress and innovation, so that one day we can build a future free of engineered threats like the aDAM attacks. You have a chance to change the world, here, today, by choosing a life of science. I hope my story inspires you to do just that."

The applause was thunderous. I smiled, though my heart ached at the memories stirred up. The aDAM attacks had given me a mission and a purpose. I was glad I could channel the grief and loss into something positive. It was a good job; I sacrificed too damn much  for this world, and it had given little in return. But being a touring guest lecturer, inspiring young minds to choose the path of science, was a dream come true.
