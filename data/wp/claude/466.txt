The frozen continent of Antarctica lay open for the taking. For decades, the Antarctic Treaty had preserved the continent as a scientific preserve, but it had expired in 2048 as nations squabbled over its renewal. Now, all bets were off.

Jake pulled on his thermal parka and checked his gear one last time. As a member of the 108th Airborne Division, he had trained for extreme cold weather combat but never thought he'd be deployed to Antarctica. After decades of breakneck industrialization and population growth, the world's natural resources were utterly depleted. Antarctica's untouched mineral wealth made it the final prize, and the major powers were willing to fight over it. 

Within hours of the treaty's expiration, fleets of mining ships from the Chinese Federation, the India-Southeast Asia Alliance and the North Atlantic Federation descended upon the Antarctic coastline around the abandoned research stations. But the untouched interior remained up for grabs.  Jake's mission was to parachute in and establish a forward base at the South Pole to cement the North Atlantic Federation's claim.

The transport plane streaked over the endless expanse of ice. Jake's breath caught in his throat as he gazed at the sight below. Having grown up his whole life in the concrete jungles that sprawled across every livable inch of the Earth, he couldn't imagine so much...emptiness. 

The jump light turned green, and Jake and his squad leapt into the frigid air. After a few minutes of peaceful drifting, the ground rushed up to meet them. They landed without incident and quickly set up their shelter and defenses. They only had a few hours before rival forces were expected to arrive.

Three hours later, radar picked up incoming aircraft. Jake peered through his binoculars at specks on the horizon that soon formed into gunships emblazoned with Indian markings. Jake's squad scrambled to activate their anti-aircraft batteries.  They let off the first shots, downsing one gunship, before jets screamed overhead and dropped their payload. A missile exploded meters in front of Jake, knocking him off his feet. He struggled to stand, shouting orders to his men, before charging into the fray. The battle for the South Pole had begun.

For two days, Jake's squad fought bitterly against the rival forces of India and China for control of the Pole. Despite being outnumbered, their superior training and equipment gave them an edge. But not without losses—a third of the squad was dead or injured. During a lull in the fighting, Jake gazed at Earth hanging over the horizon—a battered blue marble from which all hints of green and life had long been erased.  In that moment, the futility of the war for resources sunk in. There would be no victory, not really. Only a slow defeat for humanity as it devoured itself in the vain pursuit of perpetual growth on a finite planet. Jake wondered if future generations—if there were any—would judge them harshly for their shortsightedness. But for now, the only choice was to fight on for another day of diminished returns, in a world that was irreparably broken.
