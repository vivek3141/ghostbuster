The Night Shift 

by Your AI Assistant

Jenny sighed as she walked through the empty halls of the old warehouse, her flashlight bobbing in the darkness. The night shift was always the worst. The old building creaked and groaned, shadows seemed to move and take on a life of their own.  

As she made her usual rounds, checking that all the doors were secure, Jenny's thoughts drifted to her warm bed waiting at home. She wondered if she'd be able to sleep when she finished her shift, her body still stuck in the rhythm of the daytime hours. 

Suddenly, Jenny heard a loud crash in the distance. Her heart lurched. "Hello?" she called out timidly. Silence greeted her. Probably just another fallen box or equipment malfunction. Still, her hands shook as she continued walking.

In the middle of the warehouse was a rickety old staircase leading up to the offices on the second floor. As Jenny shone her light up the stairs, for a split second she could have sworn she saw a silhouette of a person at the top. But when she blinked, it vanished. Her mind was playing tricks on her, as always.     

As Jenny made her way up the creaking steps, she started singing to herself to stay calm. At the top, she swept her light back and forth, revealing nothing there. She sighed in relief. Still, she couldn't shake the eerie feeling that something wasn't right.      

She rushed through the offices, checking each room twice as fast as usual. As she made her way back to the stairs, her flashlight flickered and died. Batteries. Perfect timing. Now cloaked in darkness, each step down the old stairs seemed uncertain and perilous.

Finally at the bottom, Jenny pulled out her emergency flashlight and flicked it on. Its dim light barely cut through the blackness of the warehouse. As she peered around with dread, suddenly two green lights flashed on in the distance. Eyes.   

     There was something in there with her. Jenny's heart stopped as the creature started lurching toward her, its unearthly shape becoming clear in the shadows. She ran. Stumbling in the darkness, Jenny dropped her useless flashlight. She crashed through corridors and storage rooms, the thing following close behind, green eyes flashing.    

Finally Jenny burst through the exit out onto the street, breathing hard. Behind her, the old warehouse stood silently. Empty. As the sun slowly rose over the horizon, the building seemed harmless and mundane once again. But Jenny knew the truth of what lurked within on those long, lonely night shifts. She resolved this would be her last. The End.
