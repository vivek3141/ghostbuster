The transmission came in on all frequencies, broadcast in every language. “People of Earth, we have been observing your planet for some time. We are an alliance of intelligent species from nearby star systems. We come in peace.”

At first, it seemed like a hoax, some elaborate prank. But the messages kept coming, from massive ships that made no attempt to hide. They entered high orbit, visible to the naked eye and trackable by every ground telescope and satellite. There was no denying the evidence before our eyes. First contact had been made.

Diplomatic channels opened as leaders from every nation communicated with the alien alliance. After a tense few days, they agreed to send an envoy to meet with representatives from the UN. The sleek alien ship landed outside New York City, and three creatures emerged and entered the UN assembly. 

They were humanoid, though clearly not human. Tall and thin, with pale blue skin and oversized black eyes. They introduced themselves in perfect English as Talo, Xixi, and Hymm. The Secretary-General greeted them nervously. “Welcome. We have so many questions. Why have you made contact now? Why not earlier?”

The creature Talo stepped forward. “We apologize for the delay. We have been observing Earth for many of your human generations. But first contact is a serious matter, and we had to determine if humanity was ready.”

“How did you decide we were ready now?” asked the Secretary-General.

The aliens looked at each other, as if choosing their words carefully. “In truth, you were not always ready,” said Talo. “Your species had to become peaceful enough, to evolve beyond certain behaviors that once defined most of human civilization.”

A chill went down the Secretary-General’s spine. “What do you mean, once defined us?”

Xixi blinked its large black eyes, then said, “For the vast majority of human history, your species engaged in tribal warfare, killing members of your own kind over resources, beliefs, and perceived differences. And as human technology progressed, so did the scale of the violence. You developed weapons of mass destruction and engaged in global conflicts that caused tremendous loss of life and suffering.”

“When we first detected your transmissions over a century ago, planet Earth was engulfed in two massive wars that spanned the globe,” said Talo. “And in the decades that followed, humanity remained heavily militarized and divided. We could not make open contact under those circumstances.”
