The Shimmering Obelisk 

The sun beat down mercilessly on the endless sea of sand that stretched as far as the eye could see. Somewhere in that sea of sand stood the Obelisk, shimmering like a mirage on the horizon. 

Jax wiped the sweat off his brow and took another swig of the lukewarm water in his canteen. His camel trudged on at a steady pace, its hooves sinking into the soft sand with each step. They had been walking for days, following the bearing to the Obelisk according to his compass.

His was the last of the five parties that had set out from the village to finally reach the Obelisk. The others had turned back, defeated by the harsh conditions and convinced it was impossible. But not Jax. He had to see it with his own eyes.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, the Obelisk seemed to glow an unearthly orange. His camel grunted in protest, eager to stop for the night, but Jax pressed on for another hour until darkness fell. They made camp under the dazzling canopy of stars, the Obelisk visible in the distance, a black needle against the night sky.

When dawn broke, Jax realized with a thrill that the Obelisk seemed noticeably closer. No longer just a speck, he could make out its rough surface and triangular shape. His camel snorted enthusiastically, as if it could sense the end of their journey was near. 

They walked all day, stopping only briefly to rest. Jax no longer felt the ache in his joints or the fatigue in his muscles. His eyes remained fixed on the Obelisk, growing ever larger as it drew closer. 

As the sun dipped low again, Jax finally reached its base. He stood in the shadow of the ancient stone edifice, gazing up at its peak high above him. Up close, he could see it was covered in strange symbols and markings. 

Jax smiled as he caressed the stone with his weathered hand. Generations of people had tried and failed to reach this place. But here he stood, the first human being to reach the Obelisk since the dawn of civilization. The endless journey had been worth it, if only to solve the millennia-old mystery that had both tormented and motivated humankind. The earth was flat, surrounded by a sea of sand, but there were still wonders left to find.

Jax sat down with his back against the base of the Obelisk, finally at peace in the knowledge that the impossible was possible. Above him, the stars emerged one by one as the inky black sky came alive.
