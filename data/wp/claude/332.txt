The cabin was nestled deep in the forest, miles from any other sign of humanity. As night fell, the darkness crept in like a silent intruder. 

Mark sat by the fireplace, flames dancing, crackling. His dog slept by his side, occasionally twitching in her dreams. He was used to the solitude, the isolation. Most nights he found it peaceful.

Tonight, however, the darkness felt oppressive. It seemed to seep into the cabin, filling every corner. Mark found himself peering into the shadows, certain there was something there. The firelight flickered, and for a moment the room plunged into darkness.

In that brief second, Mark's heart raced. His skin prickled. The darkness felt alive, watching and waiting. He scolded himself for the foolish feeling, but couldn't shake the sense of being observed.

His dog woke with a start, ears pricked, eyes fixed on the window. A low growl rumbled in her throat. Mark's pulse quickened as his eyes followed her gaze. Was there something out there, peering in? A face in the blackness, pale skin and hollow eyes?

Mark shook his head. His imagination was running wild. But his dog remained alert, focused, still growling. He stoked the fire, illuminating the room once more. The feeling of being watched dissipated as light filled the corners again. 

His dog relaxed, resting her head on his knee. He patted her, taking comfort in her presence. The darkness may seem ominous, but it fears the light. As long as the fire still burned, the shadows couldn't touch them. The night held nothing to fear, so long as they kept the darkness at bay.
