The Void Awaits 

Captain's Log, Stardate 9735.2. This is Captain Zoe Hunt of the starship Hyperion, patrolling the outer edges of the Collapsar Cluster. Our long range sensors have detected the final star in this universe, an aged red dwarf, is entering the last stages of its life. In a few short hours, it will burn out, and an eternal night will fall.

I gaze out the main viewscreen at the faint glow of the dying star, little more than an ember now, struggling to stay alight in the inky black void. Those feeble photons have traveled for millennia to reach my eyes, a journey now coming to an end. 

My crew is solemn as we make our final patrol. We have witnessed too many stars gutter and die over the decades. “Steady as she goes,” I order my helmsman, though there is little point. With the last star's demise, all remaining planets, moons and asteroids will drift endlessly in the lightless cold.

In the rec lounge, the crew gathers for a final meal under the warm glow of artificial lights. Laughter and jokes are halfhearted, as the weight of the encroaching darkness bears down upon us. I give a short speech and raise a toast, “To the stars that were, and the memories we will carry forward.”

Doctor Javik, our holographic CMO, appears on the bridge. “Captain, all crew members report readiness for the long night.” I give a nod, though no one can truly be ready for what is to come.

“Dropping to sublight,” reports my helmsman. Our engines power down as we drift silently through space. In the distance, the last star flares and then fades into oblivion. The bridge is bathed in darkness, lit only by control panels and a few emergency lights.

We have prepared for this moment, stocking supplies for generations of crew in hibernation chambers. But as the weight of the void settles upon my shoulders, I wonder if any amount of preparation could be enough. The familiar stars that have guided my people are gone. All that remains is an unending sea of black, and the cold indifference of a universe slipping into heat death.

This is the end of all things. The last stars have wearied of their long vigil, and now pass gently into the long night. All that remains is our tiny oasis of warmth and light, floating through the void until time itself unwinds. The future is unwritten. The Hyperion and her crew will wander the vast and lonesome dark, Bearing the memories of stars now faded into myth, as the deep night beckons us toward an unknown destiny. Our voyage continues onward, into the abyss.
