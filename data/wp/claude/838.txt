The clock by my bedside read 3:35 am. The piercing sound of sirens in the distance woke me from a deep slumber. As I rubbed my eyes, my phone dinged with an incoming message. 

Still half asleep, I reached for my phone and was shocked awake by what I read. "Last bookings for the escape spaceships close at 3:50 am."

My heart raced. This was the warning we had feared. The long-speculated catastrophe had finally come to pass. I sprang out of bed and ran to the window, peering outside. In the distance, a menacing red glow lit up the sky, steadily intensifying like a wildfire out of control. The acrid smell of smoke reached my nostrils even from miles away.

Panic started to set in as the realization hit - we had to flee Earth immediately to have any chance of survival. I grabbed a backpack and threw in essentials for long-term space travel, though there was no way of knowing if or when we might find refuge. 

Rushing to board the escape spaceship with only minutes to spare, the scene was chaos and confusion. Blast doors were closing and locks engaging as the ships prepared to launch. Strapping into my seat aboard the craft, I watched in horror out the tiny porthole as fire and brimstone rained down on the place I once called home. The Earth I knew would be no more. As the ships thundered into space, tears rolled down my cheeks at the thought of everything left behind, now turned to ashes and dust. An uncertain future lay ahead for the remnants of humanity. The final chapter of life on Earth had come to a cataclysmic close. All that remained was the cold, harsh void of space - and hope that a new home might someday be found.
