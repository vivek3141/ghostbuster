Every authority was baffled but for the past few years everyone had been receiving a Christmas present. To some delight and others horror, the gifts were based on how 'good' you'd been. 

Jenny woke up on Christmas morning filled with a sense of dread. She walked downstairs hesitantly, not sure what awaited her under the tree. To her surprise, there were no presents. She frowned, confused. Had she been forgotten?

The doorbell rang. When Jenny opened the door, she gasped. There was a brand new BMW, wrapped in an enormous red bow. A card on the hood read: “ForServices Rendered. Merry Christmas!” 

Jenny's jaw dropped. A car? What had she possibly done to deserve this? She wracked her brain, trying to figure out what ‘services’ she could have provided to warrant such an extravagant gift. She came up blank.

Across town, Mark felt the same apprehension as he descended the stairs. But under his tree, there were no presents either. He felt a wave of relief, thinking he had escaped the mysterious gift-giver's notice this year. 

His doorbell rang. When he answered, he saw a single piece of paper on his doormat. In bold red letters it read: “You could have helped that old woman across the street. You didn’t. Do better next year.”

Mark shuddered, chills running down his spine. How did they know he had ignored his neighbor's call for help last week when she slipped on the ice? He resolved to make it right and help the old woman as much as he could in the coming year. He did not want to receive another note like that.

The mysterious Christmas tradition had started a few years ago. At first, people received normal presents from unknown benefactors – gift cards, donated toys, small trinkets. But over time the gifts became more personal, tailored to people's actions over the preceding year. For those who had performed acts of kindness or gone out of their way to help others, the presents were lavish – new cars, paid-off mortgages, large cash gifts. 

For those who had been negligent or cruel, the 'gifts' were more ominous – a lump of coal, a scrap of paper highlighting a moral failing, one year the gift was just an empty box. The message was clear: do better next time.

The identity of the gift-givers was unknown. No one took credit for the tradition and there were no names or return addresses on the presents. The gifts simply appeared, as if by magic.  Many worried they were being constantly watched and judged. Psychologists noted a rise in anxiety and paranoia, as well as an increase in charitable donations and volunteerism.

Jenny knew with the shiny new BMW in her driveway, she must have done something right this year. She made a resolution to continue helping others whenever she could in the coming year, hoping the BMW was a sign of more good things to come. She didn't want to end up with an empty box or a pointed note like her neighbor Mark.

Like it or not, the mysterious tradition seemed to be making people kinder and more compassionate. And so, despite the concern from officials about the stealthy anonymous benefactors, the gift-giving continued as people tried their best to stay on the nice list - and avoid the naughty.
