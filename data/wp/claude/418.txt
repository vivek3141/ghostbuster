The Cubicle Wish 

Mark sighed as he settled into his gray cubicle, the same one he had inhabited for the last 10 years. As an accountant at Smith & Partners, every day blended into the next in a sea of numbers and spreadsheets.

As he organized his desk, his hand brushed against something unfamiliar under a stack of papers. He pulled it out—it was an old dried out monkey's paw. "Weird," he muttered. He had never seen anything like that in the office before.  

Mark examined the paw, noting that it looked oddly realistic. His colleague Jenny walked by and peered over the cubicle wall. "Ew, what is that?" she asked. Mark explained how he had found it under some papers.   

"It almost looks like one of those cursed mummified monkey paws that grants wishes," Jenny said with a laugh. She continued walking to the breakroom, leaving Mark alone with the paw.

He knew it was silly, but he decided to give it a go. "I wish for a promotion and a big raise," he said, grasping the paw. To his shock, two of the gnarled fingers instantly closed. His pulse quickened. 

The next morning, Mark's boss stopped by his cubicle. "Congratulations, we're promoting you to senior account manager and increasing your salary by 25%."    Mark grinned from ear to ear. 

At home that night, Mark told his wife the incredible news. She was thrilled at his new position and pay. "We should go out and celebrate!" she exclaimed.  

A week later, Mark noticed some strange entries in the company's books. After investigating further, he realized the company's new client had made fraudulent claims resulting in huge profits for the firm. He had to tell his boss.

The boss's face turned red with anger. "The client threatened to sue if we challenged them. You should have turned a blind eye—now we'll lose millions! We're going to have to let you go."

Mark's stomach dropped. Because of the promotion, he had uncovered deceit that now cost him his job. His wish had backfired.

Dejected, he returned home and told his wife the news. "But honey, we were depending on that extra money! How could you mess this up?" she cried.  

Mark retrieved the monkey's paw and made a second wish for another new job with an even bigger salary. Again two fingers closed. The next week he was offered a VP role at a rival firm with a 50% pay increase.

Overjoyed at his luck, Mark failed to read the fine print. The new job required 70 hour work weeks in a high pressure environment. He never saw his wife or kids and the strain caused health issues. The big salary was meaningless.     

Mark realized each wish came with unforeseen consequences. The monkey's paw granted his desires in the worst possible way. He grasped the paw to make one final wish—to return his life to the way it was, in the little gray cubicle he had always known. For the first time, no fingers closed. The last wish had set him free.
