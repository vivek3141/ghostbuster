The cabin in the woods was our family's summer retreat, a place to escape the buzz and hum of everyday technology. When we were young, we could at least turn off our devices for a few weeks of rustic living. 

Dad would start the generator in the mornings to get the coffee percolating. It would power the fridge for a few hours so we could have milk in our cereal. Then he'd turn it off to preserve fuel. No other electronics were allowed.

My brother and I would race through the woods, playing make-believe games for hours on end. We built forts, spotted wildlife, tasted wild berries, and gazed at the stars in the inky black sky at night. The only sounds were the chirping birds, rustling leaves, and our own laughter.

Mom would cook simple meals on the wood-burning stove, making pancakes, grilled cheese sandwiches, and s'mores over the fire. We kept a weather eye on the stove, hoping she'd make her famous peach cobbler when the peaches were ripe.  

At night, we lit lanterns and gathered around the fire to share stories. Dad strummed folk songs on his guitar as we all sang along. We were fully present in the moment, not distracted by texts, emails, or social media. Our entertainment was each other.

The trips to the cabin slowed as we got older and life got busier. Summers now are filled with jobs, activities, and friends. But those simple childhood days remain etched in my memory. The days of turning off devices and tuning into life's quieter moments. A reminder of the joy to be found by unplugging from the modern world.

Sometimes I long to escape back to that cabin in the woods. To go off the grid, slow down, and be fully immersed in living simply again. When life was less complicated and we could turn off our devices and turn on our imaginations. Though decades have passed, the cabin's call remains.
