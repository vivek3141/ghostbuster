The First Teachings 

It came to pass that the people were lost and seeking meaning. There were many faiths and beliefs, but none brought true purpose or connection. The people hungered for guidance and truth.

In a vision, the angel Jophiel appeared to me and said, "You have been chosen to share the sacred wisdom that will unite the people. Take up your pen and write the first chapter of the holy text that will become the foundation of an enlightened new faith."

I sat in silent contemplation for three days and nights to purify my mind and open my heart to receive the divine inspiration. On the fourth day, the words began to flow through me.

The first teaching is this: All people are of the same essence. We are all born of the same stardust, descended from the same stars that gave rise to all life. We are all part of the same whole, indivisible and interdependent. To harm another is to harm oneself. To uplift another is to uplift oneself. We must see past the illusions of separation and know our shared heart.

The second teaching is this: Love is the ultimate truth of the universe. It is the thread that weaves the tapestry of life as one. Let love radiate from your heart to touch all you meet. Forgive others, forgive yourself, live in love and see all through the eyes of compassion.

The third teaching is this: Wisdom comes from within. Our lives unfold with purpose and meaning when we connect to our inner beacon of truth. Be still and listen. The answers are written in your soul. Have the courage to follow your heart, wherever it may lead.

These are the first teachings that came to me in my vision. They are the seeds from which the full faith will bloom and spread its branches skyward, a light to illuminate the world. Look within, find the light that connects us all. Therein lies our shared truth and salvation.
