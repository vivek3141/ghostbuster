The transport ship landed silently in the dead of night. I knew they were here, as the lottery selection is always precise. At 16, this was my first selection, my name randomly chosen to be among the tithe, the tenth of the population demanded every 10 years by the alien overseers who ruled our planet.  

Most went willingly, believing it a noble sacrifice to save humanity. But I refused to accept this fate. I knew the rumors, that the "chosen" were never heard from again, likely subjected to horrors unimaginable. Whatever the aliens had planned, I was not going to go quietly.

As the transport doors slid open with a hiss, I launched my surprise attack. The flash grenade I had made blinded the first set of guards, as I opened fire with my plasma rifle, honed from salvaged tech and black market deals. The guards never expected resistance; their hubris would be their downfall.

I managed to get several shots off, taking down guards and buying precious seconds to run and dodge their return fire. But their weapons were far superior, and a searing blast caught my side, sending me tumbling.

As the alien captain approached for the killing shot, time seemed to slow. I looked into its strange but all too familiar eyes, and saw not evil but a deep resignation and sadness. In that moment I realized—the tithe was as much a sacrifice for them as for us. They gained no joy from this, only a sense of desperate necessity.

The captain's weapon wavered, just for a moment. But that moment was enough. I flung my last plasma charge with all my might, and watched as the alien ship erupted in a blossom of flame, freeing us of our overlords and breaking the cycle of the tithe forever. Sometimes, hope comes from the unlikeliest of places—and the greatest sacrifices are the ones we make for each other.
