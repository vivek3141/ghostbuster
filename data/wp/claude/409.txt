The piercing screams echoed through the old house, drifting up from the basement. Mark gritted his teeth as he dragged on his cigarette, wishing for the first time he didn't have such keen ears.  

It was the third night of the full moon, meaning three more after this. He had known it would come to this when his daughter had started showing the signs a few years ago. Alyssa had been bitten as a child, cursed with the lycanthropic blood that now flowed in her veins.

The change was excruciating for her, and there was nothing he could do to ease her suffering. All he could do was chain her up to avoid her hurting anyone during those nights when the feral beast emerged. 

Mark jumped as there was a loud bang at the door. His heart raced in his chest, panic rising in his throat. What if the screams had been heard? He hesitated, considering not answering, but the banging came again, louder and more insistent.

With a trembling hand, he opened the door to find two police officers and a woman who introduced herself as a child protective services agent. "We've received a report about a child in danger at this address," the woman said crisply.

"There's no child here," Mark stammered, beginning to sweat. "I live alone."

The woman frowned, staring at him intently. "Are you sure about that sir? We heard screaming coming from inside the house. We would like to take a look around."

Mark's protests fell on deaf ears as they pushed past him into the house. He followed helplessly as they searched the first floor, dread building inside him with every step they took closer to the basement door.  

The screams had mercifully subsided, but as they opened the basement door they descended into a scene from a horror film. Alyssa was chained to the wall, her clothes torn, wrists rubbed raw and bleeding from her efforts to escape her bonds.

She had changed back to her human form, her naked body covered in self-inflicted scratches and bruises. The child services agent gasped, hand flying to her mouth. The police officers rounded on Mark, grabbing his arms as the agent rushed to free Alyssa.

Mark didn't resist as they arrested him, despair flooding over him as Alyssa whispered "I'm sorry, Daddy" before they took her away. His little girl was now in the care of strangers for the first time in her life, on the one night he was supposed to protect her. The curse had destroyed his family, just as he always feared it would. All that was left was the wreckage of what once was, and memories of the screams that came every full moon.
