The Family Sin

It was just another Sunday family luncheon at grandmother’s estate. Isabel dreaded these gatherings. Not because she didn't love her family, but because of the cursed ability she had been burdened with since birth. 

Whenever Isabel closed her left eye, her right eye could see the last sin committed by anyone in her view. She did not want to invade others’ privacy this way, but she had no control over this power. At least here, surrounded by her large extended family, there were so many people that the sins blurred into a haze and she could avoid focusing on any particular person.

Isabel walked in and greeted her grandmother with a warm hug. “Lovely to see you child,” her grandmother said. “Are you keeping yourself out of trouble?” Isabel smiled. If only you knew, she thought. She joined her siblings and cousins, all chatting happily. Isabel’s twin brother Isaac, always attuned to her moods, gave her arm a squeeze. 

During lunch, inevitably, some family drama began to unfold. Two of her uncles had been in a dispute over property boundaries for years and the old arguments erupted again. Voices were raised, accusations hurled. Isabel closed her eyes in dismay. When she opened them again, the sins became visible like spiders weaving webs in the room, connecting the disputants to the other family members taking their sides. Lies, betrayal, envy – all were on display.

Isabel’s head began to throb. The sins were giving her a headache, as they always did. She turned to Isaac. “I need air. Walk with me?” Grateful for his sensitivity, he escorted her out to the garden.

In the rose garden, her left eye still closed, Isabel saw a young maid hurry out of the bachelor’s quarters, adjusting her dress. The sin of lust hung over her like a scarlet letter. Isabel winced and opened her left eye again. The sins all vanished. She leaned against Isaac, exhausted. Why was she cursed so?

Her brother wrapped an arm around her. “I wish I could share your burden, sister. But all I can do is offer my compassion. You are strong enough to bear this.” 

Isabel shook her head. “I do not feel strong. I feel as if I will drown in the sins of others, with no escape.”

Isaac held her. "You can escape, as you always have. In prayer, in solitude, in acts of charity. Focus on the light, not the darkness.”

Isabel smiled gently at her twin, the one person who knew her gift and did not judge her for it. She straightened up, her headache easing. “Thank you, brother. As always, you are right.”

Arm in arm, they walked back into the house. Their family remained as sin-ridden as all families. But as long as Isabel had her quiet moments of escape, and the support of those who loved her, she could continue to bear her burden. The curse could even become a gift, she thought, if it gave her greater compassion for the sins and weaknesses of others.
