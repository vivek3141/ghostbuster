The Zygonians were avid consumers of human cinema and television. They had access to broadcasts and streaming services from all over Earth and delighted in experiencing the creative works of humanity. However, there was one aspect of human storytelling that frustrated the Zygonians to no end: plot holes. 

The Zygonians were a highly logical race and the illogical gaps, contradictions, and inconsistencies in human plots drove them mad. After the Zygonians watched a film or TV show, they would gather to pick apart the plot holes and try to resolve them. But some were unresolvable.

Two Zygonians, Zeeblax and Florp, were discussing the latest series they had binged, a show about zombies. "How did the outbreak start?" asked Zeeblax. "The first episodes suggest it was a leaked bioweapon but then it’s never mentioned again. And how come the zombies retained enough memory to go to familiar places but forgot how to open doors or climb stairs?"

"I know!" exclaimed Florp, his tentacles flailing in annoyance. "There were so many plot holes I almost couldn't finish it. But I love the human characters and their survival stories. I wish there was a way to fix this problem." 

An idea came to Zeeblax. "What if we travel to Earth and pitch ourselves as story consultants? We know plot and logic better than any human. We could review scripts and make recommendations to shore up issues before filming even starts."

Florp's eyes lit up at the prospect. The two of them hatched a plan and built a transport to take them to Hollywood. Upon arriving, they marched into a major studio and announced that they would operate as a "script logic service" to solve plot holes and offer airtight storytelling. At first, the studio executives laughed them off—until Zeeblax and Florp got their hands on a script for an upcoming release and provided a detailed analysis of 20 major plot holes or logic flaws, along with reasonable fixes for each.

The executives' jaws dropped. They had never seen such skill at crafting an logically coherent story. Within a week, Zeeblax and Florp had more work than they could handle, fixing scripts for the studio. The Zygonians' dream had come true. And moviegoers around the world would never see an unsatisfying plot hole again.
