The old Buick sputtered down the winding mountain road, struggling with the steep incline. Inside, Bill cursed as the engine choked again. He should have taken the Interstate instead of this godforsaken back road, no matter how much time it saved. 

As the Buick rounded a sharp bend, the front tire blew out. Bill wrestled with the wheel as the massive car skidded and slammed into the rocky cliff face. The airbags exploded, pinning Bill in place as his consciousness faded.

When Bill awoke with a pounding headache, he was in a hospital bed. A doctor explained he had been in an accident and suffered a concussion, but would recover fully. However, his eyes had been damaged beyond repair. Fortunately, a donor match had been found. Eye transplant surgery was scheduled immediately.

The surgery was a success. A few days later, the bandages came off. Bill blinked, overjoyed at the simple act of seeing again, even if everything was still a bit blurry. 

A week later, Bill's sight had sharpened. But he noticed strange things. Shadows seemed deeper and darker. His cat refused to be in the same room as him, fur standing on end, hissing and swatting anytime Bill came close. His dreams were filled with disturbing visions of flames and anguished faces. 

Bill shook off the strange experiences as his mind adjusting to the transplants. But soon, other peculiar things started happening. The old elm tree in his yard withered and died overnight. Milk curdled in the fridge as soon as he opened the bottle. And his eyes—he could swear at times they glowed red in the mirror. 

One night, a sinister voice spoke inside his head, unlike any dream: “Finally, I have returned.”

Bill screamed, clutching his head. The voice came again: “You cannot escape me. I am within you now.”

He realized with dawning terror the truth. His new eyes were not just any donor’s. Somehow, the devil himself had inhabited a mortal body, only to be killed and have his eyes transplanted. Now the devil was awake again, trapped inside a human host, wanting out. 

Bill gazed in the mirror at his glowing red eyes and knew the devil himself now peered out at the world through them. He had thought the back road drive was hell. Now he knew a true hell had only just begun. The devil was reborn in Bill's eyes.
