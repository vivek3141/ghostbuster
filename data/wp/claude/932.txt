Jenny sighed as she settled into her seat for the long flight from New York to London. Her doodling habit always emerged during long, boring situations and transatlantic flights were peak doodling time. 

A few hours into the flight, Jenny was startled from her dozing by a loud commotion near the front of the plane. She peered over the seat in front of her and saw three men in paramilitary garb waving guns and shouting at the passengers and flight crew.

"Stay in your seats and nobody gets hurt! We are taking over this plane in the name of the true Irish republic!" the largest of the men bellowed. 

Jenny's heart started racing. Hijackers! She had to do something to stop them but she had no idea what. In a panic, she grabbed the Sharpie from her bag and started doodling on her air sickness bag - the only thing she had to draw on.

The hijackers marched through the plane, brandishing their weapons. As the largest man passed Jenny, she showed him her doodle - a poorly drawn shark biting the hijacker's leg. "Is this supposed to scare me?" he scoffed.

Suddenly, the hijacker screamed. A shark had materialized and was gnawing on his leg! He tried shaking it off to no avail. The other hijackers stared in shock, unsure of what was happening.

Jenny doodled again, this time a rope snaring one of the hijackers. A rope appeared, tightening around the hijacker and causing him to drop his gun. 

The third hijacker raised his gun at Jenny in terror. Summoning all her artistic skill, she doodled a cage around the final hijacker. But her poor drawing abilities meant the cage was uneven, bumpy and enabled the hijacker to slip partially out, though he remained trapped.

The passengers erupted into cheers as the authorities arrived to arrest the would-be hijackers. Jenny smiled, proud of her bumbling doodles and sketchy artistic skills for once in her life. Her doodling habit had saved the day!
