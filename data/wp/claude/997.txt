The cliff crumbled under my feet. I scrambled for a handhold, anything to stop my descent. My fingers gripped onto a thin, gnarled root poking out of the rock face. 

I dangled helplessly, the ground hundreds of feet below. My heart pounded as I swung gently in the open air, the root creaking under my weight.

This was it. My life hung by a literal thread. The thread of this root, holding my weight by some miracle. 

Panic rose in my chest as I imagined the root giving way, sending me plummeting to a gruesome death on the rocks below.

I took a deep breath, trying to calm my nerves. Panicking would only make the root more likely to break.

Hand over hand, I slowly climbed the root, hoping it would hold long enough to pull myself over the edge of the cliff. My forearms burned, my fingers ached, but I climbed on.

With one final pull, my head crested the cliff. I dragged myself onto solid ground, my whole body shaking. 

I lay there for a long time, overcome with gratitude at feeling the earth under my back. My life had been spared, given back to me by the strength of a single, solitary thread. I would never again take for granted how fragile our existence, how tenuous our hold on life.

One thread had made the difference between life and death. Today, I had been given a second chance. I hugged the ground, overjoyed at my reprieve, as the sun set over the valley below.
