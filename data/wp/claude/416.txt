The old warehouse was supposedly haunted, condemned long ago after a devastating fire. Billy and his friends knew  they shouldn't sneak in, but they were bored that summer night. 

They forced open a rusty side door and stepped inside. Their flashlights revealed a vast, empty space. "Probably just a rumor," Billy said.

Then they heard a loud THUMP and a crash in the darkness. They whipped around, flashlights frantically scanning the space. 

There, by a remaining support pillar, was a figure in a black cloak. But instead of a skull, under the hood was...a kind old man's face. He looked up at the boys, clearly startled, dropping the heavy bag in his hands with a crash.

"Oh, I...I didn't realize anyone would be here. My apologies, lads." The figure smiled warmly. 

Billy spoke up bravely. "Are you...Death?" 

The old man chuckled. "I suppose that's one name I'm known by. Though I prefer to think of myself as an escort, helping souls pass from this world to the next."

The boys stared in stunned silence. Death continued mildly, "No need to be afraid. I'm just here on my rounds. You caught me a bit off schedule."

He tipped his cap. "Good night, lads. Best be on your way - and do take care. I'll see you again...but not too soon, I hope!" With that, Death faded into the shadows, leaving behind only the faintest scent of peppermint. 

The boys bolted from that warehouse and never returned. But Death stayed with them as a memory - not a menace, but a reassurance of gentleness in the dark.
