The lunar rover kicked up dust as we explored the far side of the moon. This region had never been visited by humans before, and we were excited to be the first. 

As we crested a hill, we all gasped. In the distance were buildings - an entire abandoned moon base. "Impossible," said Jain. "No records show any previous missions here."

We explored the base. Everything was covered in decades of dust and grime. Twisted metal and broken glass were everywhere.  "Look, spacesuits!" said Lee. We found several shredded and punctured spacesuits among the debris, with human remains inside.

In the main building, we found the mission logs. They were from an unauthorized exploratory mission in 2057. For weeks, the logs described excitement, discoveries, homesickness. The final entry read: "Unknown life form attacked base. It's fast and vicious. This will be our final entry. Tell our families we love them."

A cold shiver ran down my spine. We weren't the first here. And whatever killed the first colonists might still lurk on this lifeless, isolated world of rock and dust. I closed the logbook. "Return to the ship, now!" We fled, and did not look back at that place of long dead dreams and unknown terrors. The moon would keep its secrets.
