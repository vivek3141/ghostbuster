I cracked my knuckles and bounced on the balls of my feet, psyching myself up for the fight. The crowd was going wild, eager to see me pummel another illness into submission. As the reigning MMA champion, that was my job. 

The bell dinged, signaling the start of the match. Across the octagon, Depression manifested as a hulking, shadowy figure. Its shoulders were hunched, head hung low, as if bearing the weight of the world's sorrows.

I sprang forward and launched a volley of punches into its midsection. The crowd roared. Depression staggered back, struggling under the force of my blows. I had to be careful though. While I was trying to beat the illness out of my opponent, I didn't want to permanently injure the person. Mental illnesses were dangerous once externalized, but still connected to the psyche of the sufferer.

Depression rallied, swinging a punch that grazed my temple. I shook it off, but the glancing blow filled me with a profound despair. The illness was fighting back, weaponizing its symptoms against me. I couldn't afford to let it land too many hits. 
I redoubled my efforts, unleashing a flurry of kicks and punches. Depression cringed with each strike, its shadowy form losing cohesion as I gained the upper hand.

But I had been too overconfident. Depression launched itself at me, catching me in a chokehold and dragging me to the ground. As we struggled, writhing on the mat, a feeling of hopelessness overwhelmed my senses. The cheers of the crowd grew muffled and distant. Nothing mattered. I was alone and defeated.

With great effort, I shook off the insidious effects of the illness, reminding myself this was just another trick. I slammed my forehead into where I thought its face would be. Depression shrieked and loosened its grip, stunned by the headbutt. I broke free and scrambled to my feet, panting but ready to continue the fight.  The crowd, sensing the tide turning again, began chanting my name.

By now, Depression was tiring, movements sluggish and predictable. I began targeting weak points in its shadowy form, punching through what passed for its defenses. On and on I fought, fuelled by the energy of the crowd, until finally Depression collapsed, deflated, onto the mat. Silence fell for a heartbeat, two, three.

Then the referee rushed over and raised my arm. The crowd erupted into cheers. I had won another victory, vanquishing my opponent for good. At least for tonight. Because while I could beat an illness in the ring, the human psyche was never truly cured. There would always be new battles to fight, but I would be ready to combat whatever demons emerged, one round at a time.
