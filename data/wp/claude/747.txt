The alarm blared as Thorgrir the Mighty woke with a start in his modest one-bedroom apartment. He reached for his battle-axe out of instinct before remembering - he didn't need that today. Today was Monday, the start of another week as an accountant. 

Thorgrir sighed and put on his khakis and button-down shirt, looking at himself in the mirror. His massive frame and long, braided beard seemed out of place in the professional attire. But work was work, and the corporation paid well for his accounting skills.

At the office, Thorgrir squeezed his large body into his tiny cubicle. His neighbor, a mousy man named Herbert, was already there and greeted him with a nod. Thorgrir grunted in reply and turned on his computer.

Columns of numbers appeared on the screen. Thorgrir cracked his knuckles and attacked the figures with vigor, entering data and balancing sheets. Calculations danced in his head, soothed his restless barbarian spirit like a warm fire.

There was a ding as a new message popped up on his screen. It was from his manager, asking to see the figures from the latest mergers and acquisitions. With a few deft keystrokes, Thorgrir pulled up the spreadsheets and schedules, reviewing the numbers once more. Profit margins were lower than expected. Some costs had gone overlooked. 

Thorgrir felt a familiar heat build behind his eyes. His massive hands tightened into fists, sinews and muscles straining. The urge to reach for his axe and roar a battle cry clawed at his veins. 

With an effort of will, Thorgrir composed himself. He typed a response and included the corrected spreadsheets. His job was to account, not to rage. The company valued his skills because he saw what others missed. He took a deep breath and continued his work. The spirit of the barbarian would have to remain dormant, at least until the work day ended and he could once again embrace the thrill of battle. For now, there were numbers to crunch.
