I opened my eyes with a gasp. But instead of the hospital room I expected, I found myself in my childhood bedroom. The walls were covered in Ninja Turtles posters and my small bed had race car sheets.  

What was going on? The last thing I remembered was being in the hospital, dying of cancer at the age of 47. How was I here, in my room as a 6-year old?

A knock came at the door. "Timmy, time to wake up! You don't want to be late for your first day of 1st grade." It was my mother's voice. 

I stumbled out of bed and looked in the mirror. Staring back at me was my 6-year old self. I touched my face in shock. It was real. This was actually happening.

My mother came in, dressed in her classic '90s outfit, and smiled at me. "There's my big first grader! Are you excited?" 

I didn't know how to respond. Less than an hour ago in my memory, I had said goodbye to my mother as a gray-haired 47-year-old woman. And now here she was, youthful as I remembered from childhood. 

She frowned, sensing something off in my reaction. I realized I needed to play the part. "Yes, mommy, I'm excited!" I said, infusing enthusiasm into my voice.  

She laughed and hugged me. I breathed in her familiar scent, feeling overcome with emotion. I had a second chance at life, and with it, more time with loved ones I had lost.  

At school, I saw friends I hadn't thought of in decades. Everything felt surreal. During class, knowledge I had gained in my 47 years made the work feel simple. The teacher remarked on what an unusually bright student I was.

Over the next few weeks, I settled into a rhythm. I relived beloved memories and used my knowledge to excel in school. My parents were overjoyed at my progress and thirst for learning.

But it was also frustrating. I had to hide what I really knew and felt. I couldn't have real conversations with people who only saw a little boy. I longed to talk to someone who would understand my strange situation.

One night, I made a wish on the first star I saw: "Please, send me someone I can talk to. Someone like me." 

The next day, a new student joined our class. She introduced herself in a confident, almost adult-like tone: "My name is Clara. I died three years ago but now I'm back - just like you, Timmy." She looked straight at me and winked.   

My eyes widened. It couldn't be. I raised my hand, "Mrs. Jacobs, may I show Clara around?" Our teacher agreed.

In the hallway, I turned to her with hope and skepticism fighting within me. "Did you...really die?" 

She smiled kindly at me. "It's okay. I know this is all very strange. But you can talk to me about it - I understand because I'm in the same position."  

I threw my arms around her in relief. For the first time, I didn't feel alone in my bizarre second chance at childhood. Together, Clara and I had an opportunity to navigate this new life, make better choices, and gain an appreciation for life's beauty that only a second chance could afford. I smiled up at the sky in gratitude, overjoyed my wish had been granted.
