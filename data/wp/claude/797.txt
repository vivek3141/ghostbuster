Santa checked his list one final time. The Naughty List was longer than ever this year, filled with the names of criminals who had escaped justice throughout the year. Instead of coal, Santa would be delivering vigilante justice tonight. 

As Santa loaded up his sleigh, the reindeer pawed the ground eagerly. They knew tonight was different. Tonight they would be chasing down villains instead of delivering presents.

Santa took off into the frosty night air. His first stop: a house in Miami where a wanted drug smuggler was laying low. Santa slid down the chimney and found the man asleep on the couch, no doubt tired after a long day of violent crimes. Santa grabbed the man and hauled him up the chimney, dropping him in a gift-wrapped box on the lawn for the police to find. "Feliz Navidad!" Santa exclaimed before taking off into the night sky again.

A Cuban dictator responsible for oppressing his citizens was next on the list. Santa descended into the presidential palace under the cover of darkness while the dictator was dreaming of power and glory. Santa dragged the dictator to the courtyard and hung him in a stocking from a flagpole, a note of warning pinned to his chest for any who would follow in his tyrannical footsteps. 

In Moscow, an oligarch with ties to organized crime awoke to find Santa standing over his bed. "You have been very naughty this year," Santa said, grabbing the oligarch by his silk pajamas and dragging him up to the roof. Santa stuffed the oligarch down a chimney to the basement, the only exit locked tight. The oligarch would remain trapped until the authorities arrived to arrest him at first light.

On and on it went, Santa crisscrossing the globe to deliver punishment where it was due. A warlord in the Congo, a corrupt CEO in New York, a poacher in Kenyaâ€”none were safe from Santa's wrath and vengeance. Coal was too good for these villains; only vigilante justice would suffice. 

As the sun began to rise on Christmas morning, Santa returned home exhausted but satisfied with a night's work well done. His Naughty List had shrunk by over a hundred names. While children around the world raced to unwrap presents from the real Santa, criminals cowered in fear that next year, they may end up on Santa's Naughty List. Justice had been served.
