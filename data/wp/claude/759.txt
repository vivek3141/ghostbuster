The thick jungle stretched as far as the eye could see, an endless sea of green under the harsh Equadorian sun. Somewhere in that jungle was the village of Koenig, cut off from the outside world for centuries. And somewhere in that village was the clue to a great lost treasure. 

Mark Adams wiped the sweat off his brow as he hacked through the dense undergrowth with his machete. His guide, a wizened old man named Jorge, scampered through the foliage ahead of him, surprisingly spry for someone who must have been at least 70.

"How much further?" Mark called out. His shirt was soaked through and his shoulders ached from swinging the machete. 

"Not far now, senor," Jorge replied. "We are close to the village."

Mark had spent years researching the legend of the Treasure of Koenig, a fortune in Incan gold and jewels supposedly hidden in the tiny village centuries ago before the Spanish conquest. After years of searching, he had finally found Jorge, one of the few outsiders to have visited Koenig and made it out again. Jorge had agreed to guide him to the village, though he warned it was a dangerous journey that few had survived.

As the light began to fade, they finally emerged into a clearing. A small village sat nestled at the base of the towering green hills, smoke curling up from cooking fires. A rickety wooden fence surrounded the village. 

Jorge turned to Mark, his eyes deadly serious. "Listen to me, senor. The people of Koenig do not like outsiders and do not welcome strangers. But they may talk to you about the treasure. You must be very careful - and whatever you do, do not go into the jungle at night."

A sense of trepidation filled Mark as they passed through the gates of the village. He couldn't shake the feeling of being watched as they walked down the dirt path between small huts of wood and thatch. An old woman cooking by an open fire looked up at them, then hurriedly looked away. The only other person Mark saw was a young boy, who took one look at them and ran into a hut, yelling "Outsiders! Outsiders!"

Jorge led them to the largest hut and rapped on the wooden doorframe. A moment later, a muscular older man with a mane of grey hair emerged. He took one look at Jorge and his eyes narrowed in anger. "Jorge! What are you doing bringing this outsider here?" 

Jorge spoke in rapid Spanish, gesturing at Mark. A flash of greed crossed the man's eyes as Jorge explained why they had come. He turned to Mark, sizing him up. "So, you wish to know about the Treasure of Koenig?" Mark's heart raced. This could be the breakthrough he had been waiting for.

The man stepped aside from the doorway. "Come in. We have much to discuss." 

Mark could hardly contain his excitement as he entered the darkness of the hut, Jorge following behind. His decades-long quest for the lost treasure was finally coming to an end.

Little did he know he was walking straight into a trap. The search for the Treasure of Koenig would end that night - though not in the way Mark had imagined.
