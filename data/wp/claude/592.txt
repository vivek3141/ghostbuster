The sullen clouds hung low over the slow churning Styx river. The dead gathered on the shore, pale souls awaiting the ferryman to carry them across to final judgment. 

Hitler materialized among the spectral forms, his visage unchanged from the day he took his life in the Fuhrerbunker. The dead surrounding him were a sea of familiar faces, victims of his madness and ambition.

A murmur went through the crowd as Hitler was recognized. Gone was the cheering throngs of devotees. Here were only the dead, and they knew the truth of him now.

Two burly souls grabbed Hitler, holding him as a fray began to form. The dead clamored for vengeance, to tear the tyrant apart as so many had been by his orders. The fury built until a booming voice cut through - “Enough!”

Charon, the ferryman, loomed before the crowd. “This soul will be judged like all others. But not here, not now.” His staff thudded on the rocky shore for emphasis.

The holds loosened on Hitler. He slipped away, walking up to Charon in defiance. “I demand to be -” 

The staff swung again, clipping Hitler on the legs and dropping him to his knees before the ferryman. “You are in no place to demand anything, shade. Your eternity is out of your hands now.”

Charon gazed at the dead around Hitler. “Your judgment will come, each in your own time. This one” - he prodded Hitler with his staff - “will be last to cross today. Prepare yourself, for your judgment will not be kind.”

The dead slowly dispersed, bitterness and anger still evident on their faces. Hitler remained kneeling, realization dawning of the hell that was to come. His ambition and hubris knew no bounds in life. In death, he would learn how little power he truly had over his fate. The bills for his atrocities were coming due, and eternity awaited to exact its toll.
