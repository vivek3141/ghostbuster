The familiar notes echoed in my head as I woke up on the morning of September 11, 2001. My internal soundtrack, always present, started the day in a bright cheerful key. As I went about my typical morning routine, the music shifted and swelled to match my mood and motions, as it always did. 

When I arrived at my office on the 20th floor of the north tower of the World Trade Center, the music was flowing and energetic, propelling me into tackling the tasks of the day. Around 8:50 am, a dissonant tone rang through, like a faint alarm in the distance. I looked out the window to see flames and smoke coming from the other tower. My musical score turned menacing and chaotic.

The sounds intensified into a disturbing cacophony as we witnessed United Flight 175 crash into the south tower. My co-workers were yelling and panicking, but I was focused on the ominous symphony of warning and doom playing in my head.  I knew we were under attack. I screamed at my colleagues that we had to evacuate immediately.

We scrambled down the emergency stairs as my soundtrack became thunderous and urgent, evoking frantic urgency and mortal danger with every step. On the 18th floor landing, my music reached a fever pitch of impending catastrophe. I shouted for everyone to run as fast as they could.  

Just as we reached the base of the tower, there was a tremendous roar and quake as the unthinkable happened: the south tower collapsed. My internal music exploded into a deafening finale of chaos and anguish for all the lives lost, mixed with a deep sense of relief and gratitude for those of us running away from the graveyard of steel and rubble behind us. 

Though my mysterious musical score often provides nuance, texture and depth to my everyday experiences, the terrible sounds of September 11, 2001, are a symphony I wish I had never heard.
