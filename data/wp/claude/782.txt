My hands were shaking as I lowered the laser rifle. There, lying on the metal floor of the spaceship docking bay, was Tom. My best friend since childhood. The friend I grew up with. Shared dreams of space travel with. And now there was a smoking hole in the center of his chest where my laser blast had struck him. 

I blinked, staring in disbelief. How could I have been so stupid? We were supposed to come to the docking bay to shut down the malfunctioning robot that had been causing havoc on the ship's systems for days. We had planned it all so carefully. Sneak up on the robot, blast its circuitry before it noticed us, and head back to our cabins in time for dinner.

Somewhere, somehow in the dim light of the bay, I had mistaken Tom for the robot. His reflective spacesuit and helmet had fooled me into thinking he was the droid we were hunting. By the time my mind registered the mistake, my finger had already squeezed the trigger.

"No, no, no," I muttered, rushing over to Tom. I grabbed his shoulders and shook him, even though I knew it was hopeless. His eyes stared lifelessly up at me from behind his visor, accusing me. 

What have I done? Our ship was still three months from the nearest space station. No way to call for help. No way to revive him or undo this terrible mistake. 

In a daze, I stood up and stumbled away from Tom's body. I had to tell the captain. Explain it was an accident. Turn myself in and face the consequences of my actions. My carelessness had cost my best friend's life. There would be no forgiving myself for this. No way to make things right again.

The laser rifle slipped from my fingers and clattered on the floor as I made my way out of the docking bay on heavy feet. My heart felt as dead as Tom looked, there on that cold metal floor under the harsh lights of the ship. This was supposed to be an adventure of a lifetime. 

Instead, I had turned it into a living nightmare. All because in a split second, I mistook my best friend for a hunk of metal and circuitry. My finger slipped, and now everything was ruined. There would be no going back from this. No second chances. I had shot my friend, and now I had to live with the consequences.
