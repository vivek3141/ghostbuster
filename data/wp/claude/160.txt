The phone rang and Jennifer answered with her usual cheerful greeting, "You've reached Zenith Tech Support, this is Jennifer speaking. How may I help you today?"  

A panicked voice came through the line, "Please don't hang up! I have hostages and I need to speak to the CEO immediately!"

Jennifer froze in shock. She had clearly gotten crossed lines with someone in a dangerous situation.  "I apologize sir, but I'm just a customer service agent. I don't have any way to contact the CEO."

The man sounded increasingly agitated. "Well you better figure out a way or bad things are going to happen! I want a helicopter ready to take me out of the country in 30 minutes or I start shooting!" 

Jennifer whimpered, utterly terrified and confused about what to do. She had to keep him on the line while she contacted the police to alert them to the hostage situation. This was way above her pay grade.

Meanwhile, hostage negotiator Mark answered an emergency call, preparing to talk down a dangerous criminal. Instead an irate woman began yelling at him about her malfunctioning toaster.  

"Ma'am, I apologize but I think you have the wrong number. I'm a police hostage negotiator, not a customer support agent."  

"I don't care who you are, I paid good money for this toaster and I want a refund right now or I'll never shop with you again!" the woman demanded.

Mark sighed, realizing he had also gotten crossed lines. This was going to be a long day. And in that moment, two very different crises unfolded over the phone.
