The old diner was empty, as it was most nights. Just a single brown-haired waitress leaning on the counter reading a ragged paperback in between refilling the coffee machine and checking on the two guests in distant corners. 

In one corner a haggard man with faded hands sat staring out the smeared window into the inky black night, a cold cup of joe and half eaten apple pie sat ignored in front of him. His dusty trucker cap sat low over his eyes but did little to hide the emptiness carved into the lines of his weathered face. The flickering neon lights buzzed in the long pauses between the slow ticks of the oversized clock above the counter.

At the opposite end a teenaged girl with jet black hair and piercings in her nose chewed on the end of a red pen, her history textbook open but her gaze a million miles away. Her stylish clothes and make up were a thin armor against the sorrow that leaked from her onyx eyes. The waitress glancedover and refilled her mug but the girl didn't seem to notice as she continued to stare into the rippling coffee, searching for something just out of view. 

The waitress sighed as she packed up her paperback, the clock silently declaring another day over as it edged towards midnight. The man in the cap paid in silence and exited into the shadows. The girl blinked as the lights went out and found herself alone, the last remnants of activity fading around her like the lingering smell of fried food and hot coffee on a cold winter's night. She zipped up her coat and stepped out the squeaking glass doors into solitude as the darkness closed in.
