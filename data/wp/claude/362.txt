The sun peeked through the dusty windows of my little shop as I opened the creaky wooden shutters to let in the morning light. I took a deep breath of the fresh air, enjoying the moment of silence before another busy day began. 

My name is Tomas and I own a small apothecary in the village of Stonehaven on the edge of the Enchanted Forest. My family has owned this shop for generations, providing the local townsfolk and occasional adventurer or wanderer with tonics, potions, and remedies from the natural world around us.

As I lit the lamps around the shop and the main fireplace, my assistant Elena arrived. "Good morning, Tomas!" she said cheerfully. Elena was an orphan girl I had taken under my wing as an apprentice. She had a gift for herbology and healing, and had become invaluable to running the apothecary. 

Together we set about preparing the shop to open, dusting shelves, mopping the stone floor, grinding ingredients and mixing the base for potions. The smells of lavender, peppermint and chamomile filled the air. 

Right at opening, our first customer came through the door - Old Man Jenkins, the local farmer. "Morning Tom, morning Elena," he said. "I'm here for my back remedy. The cold weather's got my bones aching something awful." 

I exchanged a knowing look with Elena. We were accustomed to Mr. Jenkins and his never-ending need for balms, ointments and tonics. I handed him a jar of our lavender and ginger salve which he bought with a few coppers. "Thank ye kindly," he said, exiting the shop.

The rest of the morning passed in a blur of activity. Mrs. Weatherby stopped by for a fertility potion. The blacksmith needed burn ointment. Two young children came in for a cough remedy for their sister. 

In between customers, Elena and I worked on restocking shelves, chopping and preparing ingredients and making fresh batches of popular potions and tonics. By midday, my hands were stained with the remains of chamomile, rosemary, lavender and a dozen other plants and I had a coating of dust and pollen on my worn apothecary's apron.

As evening arrived, the flow of customers slowed. Elena bade me goodnight and headed home for dinner with her aunt. I tallied the day's sales and profits, cleaned and locked up the shop. 

Walking through the quiet village under the twilight sky, I felt a sense of contentment. My little apothecary shop wasn't the most glamorous occupation, but it provided a good living and I could help my neighbors in a simple way with the remedies and potions we created. An ordinary day, perhaps, but a good life and one I wouldn't trade for any other. I arrived home, ready for a cozy meal and rest before another day awakened in the village of Stonehaven.
