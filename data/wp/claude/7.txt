The old oak tree in our backyard towered over the house, its thick branches spreading out high above. Sadie loved to climb up to her favorite perch, a wide bough about halfway up that was perfect for sitting and reading. 

One hot summer night, a massive thunderstorm rolled in. Lightning flashed across the sky, thunder boomed, and rain poured down. I was watching the storm out the back window when a bright flash lit up the yard. There was Sadie, sitting on her usual branch, totally exposed.

I ran out into the rain and yelled up at her, "Sadie! I told you not to stand under the tree in the middle of a thunderstorm!"

She looked down with a start, realizing the danger. But before she could move, there was another bright flash and a loud crack—and her branch came tumbling down, crashing to the ground.

"Sadie!" I screamed. The branch lay in a tangled mess. Was she caught under it? Was she hurt? I scrambled over and peered through the leaves and branches. 

There was Sadie, clinging to the tree trunk, soaked through but unharmed. She had leapt up just in time. I helped her climb down, my heart still pounding.

"I told you not to go up there in a storm," I said as we ran inside. I was angry at her for scaring me like that.

"I know, I'm sorry," she said. "I just love watching the lightning from up high. But I didn't realize how dangerous it was until that branch came down. I won't do it again, I promise."

I gave her a fierce hug. She had learned her lesson, and we were both lucky she hadn't been badly hurt. The storm raged on outside, but in here we were safe and dry at last. Sadie would have to find a new reading spot—one that stayed firmly on the ground.
