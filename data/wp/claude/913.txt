The Extra Hour 

My alarm went off at 7am as usual. I groggily got out of bed and started my morning routine. Shower, coffee, toast, email. By the time I left for work at 8:30, the sun was shining brightly through my apartment windows.

At the office, meetings and deadlines filled my day. Around 3pm, I noticed the light outside seemed a bit dull, and realized with a start that it must be the extra hour approaching. My heart raced at the realization. I told my coworkers I had to step out for a call and hurried to the stairwell. 

There, everything had paused. Amber, from the department downstairs, was frozen mid-step climbing the stairs, files in her hands and mouth open, about to call out a greeting. Outside the window, cars and pedestrians were locked in place under the gray sky. For a moment I hesitated, overwhelmed by the implications of this impossible situation. But the extra hour waits for no one.

I left the building and strode out into the frozen city. The stillness was unnerving but thrilling. I could do anything, go anywhere. But with only an hour, I had to choose wisely. 

First, an ATM for some easy cash. I peeled off bills, my heart pounding at the minor theft. Then, a dash into an electronics store where I pocketed a new phone to replace my outdated model. My steps echoed on the street, the only sound in this temporal oasis.

With half the hour gone, I hurried towards a park I often walked through on nice days. There, I saw them: a man down on one knee before his girlfriend, everything on pause just as he was about to propose.  I put the ring into her outstretched hand, positioning her fingers to accept it, and placed her other hand in his. They were moments from a life-changing turn, if only time would restart for them.  

I checked my watch. Five minutes left. Winded, I ran to the hospital a few blocks away, dashed up the stairs and after some frantic searching, found the room I was looking for. My friend lay there, trapped between moments like the rest of the world. But there on the monitor - was that a flicker? His eyes seemed to move Rapid Eye Movement during sleep.  I watched in breathless hope as the second hand ticked down. 

Two minutes. His eyes flicked open, gazing unfocused at the ceiling. He took a shuddering breath, the first in over a year. I gasped, overjoyed, just as everything sprang back into motion - the sounds of the hospital, the movement outside the window, my friend turning towards me in confusion.

The extra hour was over, but its gift remained. My friend was awake. And somewhere not too far away, a man was standing frozen in disbelief at the woman who had just agreed to be his wife. I smiled, warmed at the knowledge of the joy and wonder about to unfold for so many. The day went on as usual, filled as always with meetings and deadlines under that once-again shining sun,  made brighter still by the extra hour's fleeting miracles.
