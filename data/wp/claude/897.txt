I was only 23 the first time they tried to kill me. 

It was supposed to look like an accident. A gas leak, a stray candle, an explosion. These kinds of things happened in old houses, my would-be murderers reasoned. 

I came home late from my job as a waiter, exhausted after a double shift. The house was dark but I could smell something strange. A sickly sweet scent I couldn’t place.

I turned on the light and that’s when I saw the gas was left on full blast on my ancient stove. The pilots must have blown out. The room was filling with gas.

In that moment, my fatigue vanished. I ran to the windows, throwing them open. Then I turned off the gas and evacuated, calling the fire department from outside.

They were stunned when their plan didn't work. I was still alive, without so much as singed hair. The fire chief said I was lucky I had come home when I did, a few more minutes and the whole place might have blown sky high.

I knew it wasn't luck. It was the long hours and late nights that saved me. My irregular schedule meant I came home at different times each day, foiling their carefully laid plans. 

A week later, I came home and noticed the back door slightly ajar. Inside, my cat was acting strange, meowing loudly. I followed his gaze and spotted a puddle of liquid under the fridge, the cat's food and water bowls perilously close. One lick and my cat would have been dead, another tragic "accident" in my old house.

That's when I decided to set a trap of my own. I installed hidden cameras, left the back door unlocked. Sure enough, two shady characters broke in late one night, pouring poison around the house, behind furniture, in dark corners. Everything was caught on camera. 

The police arrested them easily. Turned out they were associates of a former colleague with a grudge against me. I was just an easy target, alone in that crumbling old house. Or so they thought.

My cat and I moved into an apartment the next week. I figured we had used up our nine lives in that place. We were not so easy to get rid of, it seemed, and danger had a way of finding me. 

Still, as I looked down at the key to my new place, I allowed myself a small smile. They were stunned when their plan didn't work, when I didn't just curl up and die on command. Stunned because I was a survivor. And that was a trait they couldn't kill, no matter how hard they tried. I was 23 when they first tried to kill me. I've lived 23 years more, so far, despite the other attempts. And I plan to live 23 years beyond that, out of sheer spite. Let them stay stunned. I'm not going anywhere.
