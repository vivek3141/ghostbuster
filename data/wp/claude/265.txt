The twin suns of Klorox V were setting as Commander Zygon walked through the corridors of the Xazarian starcruiser. The ship's orange emergency lighting flickered on, signaling the start of the sleep cycle for most of the crew. But Zygon had no time for rest. 

Zygon entered the engine room, dimly lit by the pulsing warp core in the center. "Report," he barked at the chief engineer.

The engineer saluted. "Commander, the ship will reach Earth in approximately 3 million Xazarian time units. However, at current warp speeds, our zylonium fuel cells will be depleted in 2.8 million units."

Zygon cursed under his breath. Their mission to find a new homeworld was failing before it even began. "Are there no alternatives?"

"There is one option," the engineer said hesitantly. "We intercepted an Earth communication mentioning an 'everything bagel' that can provide anything."

Zygon raised a hairless brow. "A bagel? What in Xar's name is that?" 

The engineer brought up an image on the monitor - a ring of dough with various small spheres on top. "It seems the everything bagel is coated in a variety of seeds and spices. But some Earthlings attribute it with mystical abilities to fulfill any need or desire."

Zygon stroked his chin, considering. They had no choice. "Set a course for Earth at maximum warp. We must obtain one of these...everything bagels."

Two days later, under the cover of night, Zygon led a small team to beam down near a 24-hour bagel shop in New York City. Zygon peered through the glass, observing the bagels in a display case. "There - that circular one with the multiple toppings. That must be this 'everything' bagel."

Zygon's science officer scanned the bagel with her tricorder. "Fascinating. I am detecting nothing out of the ordinary about this bagel's composition. It appears to simply be a popular human snack."

"No matter," Zygon said. "Legends often have a basis in truth. We shall test the myth." He beamed the bagel up to their ship where the chief engineer was waiting. 

"Place the bagel in the zylonium chamber," Zygon ordered. The bagel was deposited into the chamber, but nothing happened. Zygon felt a wave of despair - had the legend of the everything bagel been mere fantasy?

Suddenly, the ship hummed with energy as the zylonium fuel cells refilled to maximum capacity. The warp core pulsed, stronger and brighter than ever before.

Zygon turned to the engineer, stunned. "The bagel...it has restored our zylonium. The myth was true. This everything bagel will solve all our resource needs!"

The engineer ran a scan of the zylonium chamber and gasped. The bagel had disappeared, consumed in the process of refueling their ship. But they now had a means to restore their vital resources - and find a new home. The everything bagel had made the impossible possible. Their mission was saved.
