The trenches were cold and wet as always that Christmas Eve. We huddled together for warmth, fearing what daylight might bring. 

When dawn broke, not a shot was fired. An eerie silence fell over the battlefield. Then, in the distance, I heard a lone voice singing "Silent Night." Other voices joined in, the carol floating over no man's land. 

A German soldier emerged from the trench, standing atop the parapet, unarmed. "Merry Christmas!" he shouted. Slowly, we climbed out to meet them. 

We shook hands, exchanged gifts of cigarettes and cognac. They were no longer the enemy. For a few hours, we played football in no man's land, trading caps and buttons. Normal men sharing laughter and cheer, as if there was no war.

The truce ended as darkness fell. We returned to our trenches. But in my pocket was a photo of a German soldier with his family. Karl. And for a brief time, there was peace on earth and goodwill between men. I would never forget my enemy's humanity, nor the miracle of that Christmas truce. The gift of peace, however fleeting, was the only gift that mattered.
