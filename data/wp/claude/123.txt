The Missing Stapler 

I sighed as I rifled through the drawers of my desk for the third time. It was nowhere to be found. My stapler had vanished.

I leaned back in my chair, annoyed at this unwelcome mystery. I had deadlines looming and contracts to staple together. Now I was going to have to trek over to the supply closet and get a new stapler, wasting valuable time.

But how did it disappear? I was meticulous about keeping a clean and organized desk. I hadn’t used it since yesterday afternoon when I stapled the Jones paperwork. It should have been sitting right where it always was on the upper right corner of my desk. 

A sinking feeling grew in my stomach as a suspicion started forming. Jackson. My overly ambitious and irksome cubicle neighbor. He was always trying to get ahead and must have noticed me stapling contracts yesterday. He was probably trying to sabotage me to gain some kind of edge. How pathetic.

I stood up and walked the three steps over to Jackson’s cube, not bothering to mask my irritation. He looked up at me over his glasses with a fake smile.

“Hey Susan, what’s up?”

“Cut the act, Jackson. Did you take my stapler?”

His smile dropped. “What? No, I didn’t take your stapler.” He seemed genuinely puzzled at the accusation.

I studied his face but couldn’t detect any signs of deception. Could I have been wrong?

“Hmm, well someone took it then. It’s missing from my desk and it didn’t just get up and walk away on its own.”

Jackson shrugged. “Beats me, but I don’t have it.”

I headed to the supply closet, confused and slightly embarrassed at my false accusation. If Jackson didn’t take it, then who did? And where could it have possibly gone? 

As I walked into the closet, a flash of red caught my eye. There, on a shelf, sat a stapler that looked exactly like mine. I picked it up, realization dawning on me. In my haste yesterday I must have absentmindedly put the stapler back in the supply closet after using it, instead of returning it to my desk. I shook my head, feeling foolish at the unnecessary drama I had created in my mind. Mystery solved. My stapler wasn’t stolen after all. It seems I was my own worst enemy today. I grabbed the stapler and headed back to my desk, eager to get back to my work and put this whole silly situation behind me.
