I opened my eyes to blinding light. But I couldn't move. I was trapped in a tiny body, hearing strange voices around me. 

Slowly, my vision cleared and I saw two giant figures peering down at me. They were speaking in a foreign tongue. With a shock I realized â€”I was a baby.

Panic rose in my mind. How did I get here? The last thing I remember was...nothing. My memories were gone. I was helpless, at the mercy of these giants who cared for my every need.

The years passed in a blur. I learned to sit, crawl, walk and talk, but I never regained control. I was a passenger, watching life happen. My keepers were called "Mama" and "Dada". They loved me, I realized, even if I didn't know why.

One day, a thought struck me: I was this child. We shared a body and a life inextricably linked. Her memories became mine, her experiences shaped my own. I guided her with a whisper, a gut feeling of right and wrong. She listened, following my lead.

We grew up together, two minds, one soul. She gave me a window into the world, and I gave her a conscience.  Our life unfolded before us, each day a new discovery. We pursued dreams and chased destinies, all the while supporting each other in a partnership unlike any other.

This was both a curse and a blessing. I lost my old self but gained a new purpose. And in the end, isn't that what all souls seek? A reason for being, and someone to share the journey with. My name is hers, and her joy is my own: we are one person, learning and thriving together every day, unable to exist without the other. Two lives, lived as one.
