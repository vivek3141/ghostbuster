Welcome students! Today we are going to learn about how to safely and responsibly use Time Travel technology. As you know, in our Universe, time travel has been openly available for several decades now. However, with great power comes great responsibility. Time travel allows us to visit the past and see history unfold before our eyes, but it also gives us the power to alter events and change the course of history. 

That is why there are strict laws and protocols in place for time travel. The first and most important rule is: do not interfere with historical events. Time travel is meant for educational and observational purposes only. Interacting with people or changing events in the past can have unforeseen consequences that ripple through time. Even the smallest interference could alter the present in unpredictable ways. 

The second rule is: do not be seen. This is critical to avoiding interference. Our time machines are designed with stealth technology to avoid detection in the past, but you must also be careful not to do anything to draw attention to yourself or give away the fact you are from the future. Blend into the background and observe quietly. The past should unfold as naturally and normally as possible.

Third, choose your destination carefully based on your age and knowledge. Travel too far back in time, and the past may be a dangerous place. Also, the farther back you go, the more likely you are to fail to avoid interfering as cultural norms and technology will be quite different. For your first trips, stick to recent time periods in human history that you have studied and understand well. 

Finally, never travel to the future. Traveling to the future risks exposing yourself to knowledge about events that have not happened yet, which could then influence your actions in the present. Experiencing future events could also be psychologically damaging. Time travel must be used only to gain a better understanding of history, not to glimpse or influence the future.

If you follow these rules, time travel can be a delightfully educational and eye-opening experience. Observing key moments in history helps us appreciate how far humanity has come, gain a deeper empathy for our ancestors, and better understand causes and consequences. But with that opportunity comes responsibility. Always remember that the smallest change to the timeline could have unforeseen and disastrous consequences. So keep your hands to yourself, don't interact, don't be seen, and don't travel to the future. If we each do our part to respect history, time travel can be enjoyed safely for generations to come!
