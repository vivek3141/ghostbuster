The blackouts started a few months ago. At first, I didn't think much of it—I had been pushing myself hard at work and enjoying a few too many drinks in the evenings to unwind. I figured the occasional lost hour or two was a result of exhaustion and one glass of wine too many.  

But the episodes started becoming more frequent. And more peculiar. The first time I came to with a scribbled note in my handwriting on the coffee table, I was perplexed. It was a complex mathematical proof that seemed to disprove one of the fundamental theories I had studied in my physics graduate program years ago. I shook it off as drunken nonsense and went to bed.

A week later, another blackout and this time pages of calculations and logic that seemed to call into question the very underpinnings of string theory. This time a cold panic started to set in. I stopped drinking altogether. But a few days of abstinence did nothing to prevent increasingly regular blackouts where I would emerge from the fog in a manic scrawl of equations, theorizing and conclusions that seemed to unravel everything I thought I understood about the world.  

I started fearing these episodes and what my unconscious mind was conjuring. The implications were terrifying if even one of these radical theories held merit. And disturbing if they didn't—was I losing my mind? Descending into a world of delusion and nonsense?

In a desperate move, I gathered all the writings I could find—stacking dozens of pages of incoherent ramblings and mad logic. I took them to a former professor who I trusted and admired, someone who had always appreciated my intellect and unconventional thinking. She agreed to review my “work” as a personal favor. I left her office feeling a mixture of apprehension and relief. Perhaps she could make sense of this or at least determine whether there were any shreds of viability that remained in the depths of my addled mind.

Two days later her assistant called and asked me to meet with her immediately. As I entered her office, the expression on her face filled me with foreboding. She told me to sit down. And then she began to speak in a hushed and deadly serious tone. She said that while the assumptions and logic in the work were unorthodox, even seemingly absurd, she could not actually find a flaw or point of refutation. According to all known laws of physics, the conclusions had standing. She was deeply troubled but felt academic integrity demanded she inform me. 

My world began spinning. I stammered questions about how this could possibly be, grasping for any rebuttal to the nightmare that was unfolding. She had none. In the end, there was only grave concern left hanging in the air and a delicate suggestion that I seek psychiatric care.

As I left her office, visions of impossibilities danced in my mind and a creeping dread took hold in my body. If my unhinged theories were right, the world was not at all as it seemed. And if they were wrong, then neither was I. The only certainty left was that the blackouts would keep coming until there was nothing left of the world I once knew. My grip on reality had become as transient and fleeting as my consciousness. And with every new page of wild scribblings, I was penning the story of my own unraveling.
