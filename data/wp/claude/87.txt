The Dream Broker

I carefully tended to the dreams in my shop, cultivating and nurturing them like rare orchids. As a dream broker, my livelihood depended on growing dreams that were beautiful, intoxicating and in high demand. 

My pride and joy was the golden dream. It was magnificent, a dream of sunshine and laughter, of crystal seas and azure skies, of joy and bliss eternal. Buyers would enter my shop, glimpse the golden dream and immediately offer vast sums to experience it.

Until yesterday. When I checked on the dream, horror flooded my veins. The golden skies had curdled to rust, the seas thickened to sludge. A sinister gloom pervaded everything. No trace remained of its former glory. My perfect dream had soured into a nightmare.

A knock sounded at the shop door. I hurriedly draped a cloth over the nightmare, hoping to conceal its decay. To my dismay, it was Lord Halburg, my most coveted client, who prized rare and exquisite dreams. "I've come for a dream to soothe my restlessness," he announced. "I hope you have something exceptional." 

My smile felt brittle as glass. "I apologize, Lord Halburg, but I have nothing suitable at present."  

His gaze travelled the shop, settling on the shrouded dream. "And what is that?" he inquired.

"That is...not ready yet," I stammered.

"Let me be the judge of that." Before I could protest further, he whisked aside the cloth. The sight that greeted him elicited a deep sigh of pleasure. "This is a masterwork. The darkness, the brooding intensity - it is magnificent!"

I stared in disbelief. How could anyone view that perverted dream with anything but horror and disgust?

He turned to me with fire in his eyes. "I must have that dream! Name your price!"

"My lord, forgive me, but that dream is unfit for sale."  

His face darkened with anger. "Must I remind you that you are in no position to refuse me?" He slid a menacing hand to the hilt of his sword.

Trapped, I saw no choice but to acquiesce. Head bowed, I told him the nightmare was his, for a paltry sum that was meaningless next to appeasing his wrath.

As Lord Halburg departed with his prize, I shuddered at entrusting that foul dream to anyone. And yet, for some, the darkness holds an allure all its own. The nightmare was now beyond my control, free to work its sinister magic or be vanquished by the light of reason. All I knew for certain was that no amount of gold or threats of force could ever compel me to broker another nightmare again. My days as a dream merchant had come to an end at last.
