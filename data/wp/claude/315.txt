The crowded subway car rattled through the tunnel. I held onto a pole, swaying with the motion of the train. 

Across from me, a striking woman with violet hair caught my eye. She gave me a coy half-smile. I smiled back, our eyes locking for a charged moment.

At the next stop, more people crammed into the car. I lost sight of the woman as I was pressed up against the doors. When the train started moving again, I craned my neck, hoping to find her captivating gaze once more.

A few stops later, the congestion cleared. I searched the car, and spotted her at the opposite end, looking right at me. Our eyes met again, and this time neither of us looked away. She started walking toward me, her eyes never leaving mine. My heart raced. What did she want? What was happening here?

She stopped an arm’s length away, lip curled in a Sphinx-like smile. “I’ve been watching you,” she said loud enough for only me to hear. Her voice was husky, almost sultry. 

I struggled for words under the heat of her stare. “I—I noticed you too,” I stammered.

She took a half-step closer. “Let’s continue this conversation somewhere more...private.” She brushed her hand against mine, electricity sparking at her touch. 

The train glided into the next station. “This is my stop,” she said, finally breaking eye contact. “Are you coming?” She turned and walked out the doors without looking back.

I stood frozen for a second, mind reeling. Then I hurried after her, following those violet tresses up the steps and into the night, eager to get lost in her eyes once again.
