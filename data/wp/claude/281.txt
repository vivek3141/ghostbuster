The year is 10 September 2008, the day the LHC became fully operational. Topluk, an extraterrestrial undercover agent phones in to his home planet to report this disturbing news.

Topluk pressed the communication device behind his ear, activating the quantum entanglement transmitter that connected him to his home planet, Xarnia Minor in the Gallius galaxy. 

"Commander, this is Agent Topluk reporting from Earth. The humans have activated their large hadron collider today. Repeat, the LHC is operational."

There was a pause as the communication device translated Topluk's message into an quantum data packet and beamed it across the cosmos at faster-than-light speed. Minutes later, a response arrived.

"Understood Agent Topluk," the Commander's voice sounded in Topluk's auditory cortex. "This is disturbing news. What is the status of the human experiment?" 

"They have successfully circulated the first particle beams in the collider, detecting collisions at the planned energy levels. The humans are celebrating, calling it a great success for science. But Commander, as we feared, they have no idea of the cataclysmic forces they are tampering with. The energy levels they are achieving could be enough to puncture the walls of our universe if uncontrolled. I recommend immediate action to shut down this device before it creates an inter-dimensional catastrophe."

Another long pause. "Your recommendation is noted," the Commander replied. "However we cannot take direct action to interfere at this time. The Council of Planets has a strict non-intervention policy for pre-warp civilizations like humanity. We must not reveal our presence or take any action that could alter the natural course of human scientific progress, no matter the risks. To do so would violate our highest laws."

"But Commander, the risk of damage to the very fabric of reality is too great!" Topluk protested. "If a runaway reaction were to occur, it could wipe humanity from existence and begin to consume our universe from within like a virus. We must do something before it's too late!"

"Enough, Agent Topluk! As much as it pains me, our hands are tied. We can only observe, and hope the humans do not trigger a catastrophe. Remain at your post, continue monitoring the situation, and report any ominous developments immediately. But there will be no direct intervention from Xarnia Minor. The Council's decision is final. Do you understand your orders, Agent?"

Topluk clenched his fists in frustration, his alien form morphing briefly under the holographic disguise generator that hid his true identity. "Understood, Commander. Agent Topluk out."  

The communication link was severed, leaving Topluk alone once more on the alien world of Earth, surrounded by humans obliviously celebrating their Faustian bargain with forces they did not comprehend, and hoping it would not lead to doom.
