The light filters through the blinds, catching dust motes in its path. I watch them dance and spin, momentarily transfixed. Then a knock at the door startles me. 

Who is it? I don't recognize the two people who enter, a man and woman. They smile at me sadly, their eyes glistening. "Grandma, it's us, your grandchildren, Mark and Sarah."

A faint flicker of recognition. Yes, Mark and Sarah. The children of...of my son? Daughter? Their names escape me. But I smile back. "Of course. Lovely to see you."

They each grasp one of my hands, squeezing tightly. They look so much older now. When did they grow up? I glance out the window at the changing seasons, the leaves turning shades of red and gold. The years seem to have slipped by silently, a relentless march I was powerless to stop. 

We chat for a while, but I find myself frequently losing the thread of conversation, grasping to catch up as words and thoughts tumble out of my reach. Mark wipes tears from his eyes, and Sarah looks away, trying to compose herself. Why are they crying? I feel a pang of guilt that I have somehow failed them.

A nurse enters with a tray of sandwiches and juice. As we eat together, sharing memories of Christmases and birthdays long past, I start to feel more at ease. These two strangers who claim to be my grandchildren, I realize now I have always known them. How could I forget? The love between us still remains, a steady anchor even as time and memory fade.

Eventually a gloom descends upon our visit. The smiles turn forced, the laughter hollow. We all know, without saying, this will likely be the last time we meet. The knowledge sits heavily upon us, an unwelcome guest we cannot escape.

As Mark and Sarah prepare to leave, I cling to them, overcome with a sudden panic. Please don't leave me alone. But the words remain trapped inside, and I can only watch helplessly as they walk out the door with one final wave goodbye. 

The light outside begins to dim as the dust motes still drift and float in the air. I lie back in bed, exhausted, trying in vain to imprint the memory of my grandchildren's visit. But already the details are slipping away, clouds obscuring the sun, and I find myself staring again at the shadows gathering in the unfamiliar corners of this place I now call home. The only thought left is a quiet, plaintive wish that the light will return once more and banish the darkness, at least for a little while longer.
