The last man on Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock on the door.

John couldn't believe his ears. He hadn't heard a knock at the door in over 3 years, since the virus wiped out the rest of humanity. His heart raced. Was his mind playing tricks on him? Was this another cruel twist in his unending torment of isolation?  

He cautiously approached the door. The knock came again, louder this time. He peered through the keyhole. On the other side stood a woman. She was the most beautiful sight John had ever seen.  

With trembling hands, he unlocked the door. The woman's face lit up with a smile. "I'm Anna," she said. John could barely speak. He invited her inside, offering her food and water. 

Anna told her story. She had been in a remote cabin when the virus hit, living in complete isolation for years. She had come to the city in hopes of finding other survivors. Against all odds, she found John.

They talked for hours, overflowing with curiosity about each other. John hung on Anna's every word, ecstatic to hear another voice. He wanted to know everything about her.

Night fell, but neither felt tired. They were both afraid this miracle would end when they woke. John proposed that Anna stay with him. His lonely world felt complete with her in it. She agreed without hesitation.  

As the sun rose, John held Anna's hand tightly. He felt something he never thought he would experience again. A flicker of hope. No longer the last man, but part of a pair, united against the solitude that once crushed his spirit. Anna was a light to lead him out of the darkness. And together, they could face whatever this new world threw at them. Side by side, hand in hand.
