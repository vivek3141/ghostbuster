The party was in full swing when Jake found himself in the kitchen, three beers in and filling up another plastic cup from the keg. 

"See the problem is: deep down inside, I'm still an asshole," he said to his friend Mark, who was leaning against the counter.

Mark raised an eyebrow. "How do you figure?"  

Jake shrugged. "I don't know, man. I just have these thoughts sometimes. Judgmental thoughts. Thoughts that make me think I haven't really changed from who I was years ago."

"We all have those kinds of thoughts at times," Mark said. "Doesn't make you an asshole."

"Yeah but I actually say those thoughts sometimes. Or act on them. Like just before we came to this party, I seriously considered bailing on Jenny when she asked if I could give her a ride. Just because I didn't feel like going out of my way. I'm a jerk." Jake took a long sip of his beer.  

Mark shook his head. "One thought or one moment doesn't define you, man. You gave her a ride, didn't you?" 

"Well, yeah, but only because I knew you'd give me shit if I didn't."

"Exactly, because you're not an asshole. An asshole wouldn't care what I thought and would have left her stranded without a second thought. But not you." Mark clapped Jake on the arm. "Stop being so hard on yourself. You're a good dude."

Jake smiled, starting to feel the tension in his chest dissolve. "I don't know. Maybe you're right." 

"I'm always right," Mark said with a grin. "Now come on, no more wallowing. Let's get back out there and have another beer. The night is still young!"

Jake laughed, relief flooding through him. Mark always knew just what to say. His friend was rightâ€”it was time to stop questioning himself and just enjoy the party. He filled up his cup again and followed Mark out of the kitchen, into the noise and laughter of the crowd. At least for tonight, the asshole inside could take a break.
