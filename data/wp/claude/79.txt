The little toy boat bobbed on the gentle waves that lapped the shore of the beach. A young boy named Timmy was playing in the sand, pushing his boat out into the shallow water and reeling it back in with a string.

On one push out into the water, a bigger wave came and snatched the string out of Timmy's hands, carrying the boat further out. "Come back!" Timmy cried, running into the water. But the waves continued to take the boat further away. His mother ran over, seeing Timmy chasing the boat, now many meters from the shore.

"Timmy, come back - it's too deep!" she shouted. Timmy began to cry, upset at losing his toy boat. 

The boat floated further out to sea, at the mercy of the winds and currents. It sailed past fish and dolphins, who glanced at this curious little craft. A seagull landed on its deck for a moment, only to peck at the shiny red paint and find it inedible.

Hours passed. The sun began to set over the ocean, burning the sky orange and pink. The little boat continued to drift. Would it be lost forever?

As night fell, Timmy walked along the beach with his mother. In the moonlight, he saw a speck bobbing in the waves, coming closer to shore. His little boat! It had survived its adventure at sea and found its way back home. Timmy raced into the surf, overjoyed as he scooped up his faithful toy boat. His adventure at sea was over, and it was time to head home.
