The call came at midnight, just as I finished cleaning and assembling my sniper rifle. My burner phone buzzed, the one dedicated only to receiving instructions. A robotic female voice spoke: "Contract 726. Target: Jessica Helen Caldwell. Location: 352 Maple Street, Apartment 8C, San Francisco, California. Method: Your choice. Instructions to be eliminated after completion. Clean this and you're done, 47." I froze in disbelief. That was my mother's name and address. After 30 years and over 200 flawless kills across the globe, my employer was giving me an impossible final job.  

This was no coincidence. My shadowy employers were testing my resolve one last time. Or perhaps this was retribution for my request to retire with my anonymity and freedom intact. I knew too much and could become a liability. Killing my mother was meant to emotionally destroy me, ensuring my silence.

I thought of refusing, going on the run. But there was no escape from an organization with unlimited resources and reach. Her death at their hands would be lingering and painful. As a world-class assassin, at least I could ensure her end was quick and merciful. 

Two days later, I waited down the block from my mother's apartment building, wrestling with what I was about to do. But I was highly trained and my shot would be precise. She would feel nothing. I entered the building, picked the lock on her door and found her in bed, sleeping. I steadied my hands, took a breath, and pointed at her head. I couldn't do it. But I had to protect her. 

I woke her up and told her she had to disappear and never contact me again. Confused and frightened, she protested. I revealed that powerful people wanted her dead, and I was supposed to kill her. She stared in shock and horror. There was no time to explain my sins and betrayals. I gave her cash, passports, and transportation to a secure location only I knew about. We tearfully embraced for the last time. 

I left and reported the kill was complete. My handlers asked for photographic proof. I provided a faked death scene using a cadaver and makeup. They accepted it without question. 

I was now free but more alone than ever. My mother was gone because of the life I had chosen, the man I had become. There would be no retirement party or golden watch, just the prison of memories and the reminder of what my hands had wrought. I left for a long journey of penance, wandering the world I had helped make darker, my atonement a solitary shadow mission without end.
