The first time my daughter called me ‘mama’, my heart swelled with joy. Her little voice, her little hands reaching for me, filled me with a love I didn't know was possible.  

As she grew, something changed in her. She became angry, violent, hurting others without remorse. Doctors had no explanation. My sweet girl was gone, replaced by a vicious stranger.  

The killings started when she was twelve. Neighborhood pets went missing. I made excuses, unwilling to believe my daughter capable of such evil.  

By fifteen, she had moved on to people. Her teachers, a store clerk, a jogger in the park. Always covered in blood, she would return home and lock herself in her room.

The police finally caught her, sixteen and feral, in the act of strangling a young boy. At the trial, she hissed and spat at anyone who came near. My baby called me ‘mama’ one last time, in a contemptuous sneer.  

Found guilty, they sentenced her to death. As they strapped her to the table, she looked at me with those once innocent eyes and mouthed the word ‘mama’ silently. In that moment, the monster was my little girl again. But then the switch was flipped, and it was over. My heart shattered beyond repair, longing for the laughing child that was and the life we might have had. The best and worst of days began and ended with that one word: mama.
