The stale air of the Depth Reaver submarine clung to Tara's lungs as she made her way to the mess hall. 18 weeks into their deep sea mission and the recycled oxygen was starting to feel heavy. 

As Tara entered, a few of her fellow crewmembers were already at the long metal tables, hunched over their algae and fungus meals. Conversations were sparse, humans preferring the company of their devices and VR rigs over another week of small talk.

Tara collected her meal pack from the dispenser and took a seat next to her friend Jonas. He was watching some old football match through his retinal display, the twin lenses casting a faint blue glow over his eyes.

"Anything interesting?" she asked half-heartedly, picking at the mush in her packet.

Jonas blinked, exiting the match as he turned to Tara. "Just trying to escape this metal tomb for a few minutes," he replied. His smile was strained. "Only 4 more months to go."

Tara sighed, longing for the sun on her face. When she signed up for the Deep Corp mission, she thought the chance to make history was worth 6 months submerged in the ocean depths. Now survival seemed a higher priority than discovery. 

"I miss the damn sky," she said. "Rain, stars, clouds, sun - I'll never take it for granted again."

"If we make it back," Jonas added darkly. 

Their conversation was cut short by a klaxon sounding throughout the mess hall. The crew immediately straightened in their seats, a hush falling over the room. After 18 weeks, they knew that alarm meant one thing - something had gone wrong.

The captain's voice crackled to life over the comms system. "Damage to the propulsion system. We've lost navigation and are sinking into a crevasse at 21 degrees N. All crew report to emergency escape pods immediately. This is not a drill. Abandon ship."

Tara's heart seized in her chest. After months sealed in a rusting metal coffin under crushing depths, their small escape pods were the last place she wanted to be stuck. But with a failing propulsion system, the choice was made for them. 

The Depth Reaver was lost, entombed in its watery grave. As Tara strapped into her pod with Jonas and the few remaining crew, she wondered how long their air would last - and if they'd ever gaze up at open skies again. The ocean held many secrets, but it did not give up its captives easily. She peered out the porthole at the inky black waters and murky abyss below, awaiting salvation or a sudden icy end in the deep.
