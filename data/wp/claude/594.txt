The windowless room was dimly lit, empty except for a metal table and two chairs. Ahmed sat in one of the chairs, hands cuffed in front of him, anxiety building. How long had he been here? Hours? Days? He couldn't tell. 

The door opened with a loud click and two agents walked in. The bigger one, Agent Smith, smiled cruelly as he sat across from Ahmed. "We've tried other methods to get you to talk, but you've proven resistant. So we're trying something...new. Something we think you'll find quite unpleasant."

Agent Smith nodded to his partner, who clicked on a large television Ahmed hadn't noticed before. The screen flickered to life, showing the menu for an Adam Sandler movie marathon.

Ahmed scoffed. "You think watching silly American comedies will break me?" 

"You won't be laughing for long," Smith said. "Exposure to prolonged periods of Sandler's juvenile humor and poor cinematic choices has been shown to cause mental anguish, depression, and loosened tongues."

The first movie, Happy Gilmore, began playing. At first, Ahmed chuckled at a few jokes, but after 30 minutes his smile had vanished. After an hour, he felt the urge to bang his head against the table. The stupid voices and nonsensical plots were maddening.

For the next film, The Waterboy, Agent Smith insisted Ahmed repeat lines of nonsensical Cajun-accented gibberish along with the characters. "Foosball is the debil, Bobby Boucher!" Ahmed resisted but eventually complied, his dignity slipping away with each stupid quote.

By the time Mr. Deeds began, over 6 hours into the marathon, Ahmed was desperate to escape Sandler's foolish mugging and exaggerated accents. "Please, turn it off! I'll tell you anything, just make it stop!" 

Agent Smith smiled and paused the movie. "I knew you'd come around. Let's start with details of your organization's terror cells in western Europe."  

Ahmed sighed and shook his head. "I have no such information. I was just trying to get you to end this intolerable experience."

Agent Smith's smile disappeared. "You may have resisted today, but we have Adam Sandler's entire filmography at our disposal. Jack and Jill, You Don't Mess with the Zohan, Grown Ups 2...this is going to be a long week for you, my friend."

Ahmed's eyes widened in fear as Agent Smith started the next movie. He began screaming, the only possible sane reaction, as the all-too-familiar opening credits for Pixels started on the screen. After this, surely death would be a welcome escape. His spirit broken, Ahmed started to talk.

The CIA's new and controversial enhanced interrogation technique had worked again. No hardened terrorist could withstand prolonged exposure to the comedic stylings of the man-child Adam Sandler. Ahmed wasn't the first to crack, and he certainly wouldn't be the last. The future was bright for Sandler's particular brand of cinematic misery in the war on terror.
