The old warehouse lurked at the end of the abandoned street, holding untold secrets behind its rusty metal door. Jill walked toward it in the pale glow of the streetlights, the clicking of her heels on the broken concrete echoing off the buildings. 

As she reached to open the screeching door, she paused. Was she really going to go through with this? She had been searching for a way to increase her scant income to support her baby daughter for months without success. When her friend Lola mentioned this "opportunity" Jill dismissed it as too risky. Yet here she was, desperately trying not to get her hopes up as she pulled open the door.

Inside, a dozen people were scattered about a makeshift lab full of electronics, tools, and computers. In the center, a lanky man with wild gray hair gestured enthusiastically, directing the activity.

He noticed Jill and strode over. "You must be the new technomage," he said. "I'm Dr. Hendricks, the pioneer of technomancy. Come, let me show you what we've been working on!"

Jill followed him, incredulous at his claim. Technomancy was what people called the idea of using technology sorcery to manipulate electronic devices. It was a thing of science fiction. 

Dr. Hendricks led her to a table where a woman tinkered with a dismantled smartphone. "Rebecca here can reassemble this phone in under a minute using her technomancy skills."

Jill stifled a skeptical laugh. The woman, Rebecca, looked up at a signal from Dr. Hendricks and swept her hands over the scattered components. In seconds, parts spun and clicked into place, eventually reforming a complete phone. 

Jill's mouth fell open. Her mind grappled for a logical explanation but found none.

Dr. Hendricks grinned at her reaction. "You see? With practice, you can master technomancy too. Now, about your payment. As I mentioned, you will receive training and a guaranteed technomage salary base of—"

"Hold on," Jill interrupted. "I don't actually have any skills. I'm just here on a friend's recommendation. I can't do...that." She gestured at the reassembled phone.

His face fell. "You have no aptitude? No instinct for technomancy? I'm afraid that is quite necessary to learn the skills."

Jill's heart plummeted. She started to turn away, blinking back tears of disappointment. Her daughter needed medicine, and Jill needed a miracle.

"Wait." Dr. Hendricks touched her arm. "There may be another option. On rare occasions, I have encountered individuals with a dormant technomancy gene that I can help activate. But the process can be intense and the results are not guaranteed."

Jill wavered, hope and uncertainty warring within her. Her baby's feverish face swam before her eyes, tipping the scales.

"I'll do whatever it takes," she said.

Dr. Hendricks's eyes lit up. "Excellent! Come this way."

He led her to a back room and had her sit before a large computer screen. "I will use a program of my own design to stimulate your cells and activate any technomancy potential. Relax your mind—and prepare for the possibilities!" 

His fingers flew across the keyboard, entering line after line of code in a blur. Jill gripped the arms of her chair as the screen began to glow. 

A tingle spread through her body, building to a thrum of energy dancing across her skin. Files flew open on the screen of their own accord, code manipulating itself. Dr. Hendricks let out a laugh of delight. 

"It's working! How do you feel?"

Jill stretched out a hand, mesmerized, as a whirlwind of numbers and symbols swirled into view. Raw data, shed of its physical form, electrified her senses. Her consciousness expanded in a rush of understanding as she grasped the intricate workings of technology on a whole new level.

She turned to Dr. Hendricks with a grin of wonder and newfound power.

"Like the first technomage."
