The whiteboard was filled from edge to edge with scribbles of equations, derivatives, and arcane symbols. Dr. Gregory Davis stood back, squinting at the board. His unwashed hair hung limply over unshaven cheeks. His eyes were bloodshot from days without sleep. 

He was onto something. He could feel it. The proof was nearly within his grasp. The mathematical evidence that would prove, unequivocally, that God existed. 

Years of work had led to this moment. Sequestered in his apartment for over a decade, shunning friends and family, sustenance and sunlight. All that mattered were the numbers. The patterns that underlaid all of existence.

His hand moved automatically, adding a new string of figures to the board. A tune started playing in his head, a fragment of something classical he had once known. It rose in tempo and volume, matching the frantic pace of his thoughts.

There. Suddenly the figures aligned before his eyes. The music peaked in an exultant climax. He saw it. The final, incontrovertible proof for God’s existence, as clear as a lightning bolt from the heavens.

He opened his mouth to shout in triumph. But his voice caught in his throat. There, sitting calmly in his armchair, was a distinguished older gentleman, regarding him serenely over wire-rimmed spectacles.

“Well done, Dr. Davis,” the man said. “You found what you were looking for.”

Gregory's mouth worked soundlessly. His eyes bulged. 

 The man smiled gently. “I'm afraid, however, that I cannot allow you to share that proof with the world.”

“But...why?” Gregory finally sputtered.

"Faith, Dr. Davis. Faith must remain a choice, freely given. Not an obligation due to mathematical certainty."

Gregory's shoulders sagged as the weight of over a decade's obsessive work crashed upon him. His great triumph crumbling into dust.

The older gentleman rose and approached him, placing a hand on his shoulder. “You have done well, Dr. Davis. But your work here is finished.” A warmth suffused Gregory's body, filling him with a deep sense of peace. 

His eyes closed. And when they opened again, he was alone in the room. The whiteboard was blank. The music in his head had faded into silence.

But in his heart, he knew with certainty his quest was over. And that was enough.
