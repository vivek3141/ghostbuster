The café was bustling with the lunchtime crowd, but Emma found a small table tucked in the back corner. As she sat down, the familiar melody drifted through the speakers, transporting her back to that night two years ago. 

It was the annual Christmas party at her office, and Emma was feeling particularly festive in her red dress and heels. She spotted Mark across the room, looking handsome as ever in a tailored suit. They had been flirting for months, their chemistry palpable with every glance and touch. As Adele crooned about finding someone like you, Mark strode over and extended his hand. “May I have this dance?” he asked with a charming smile.

Emma's heart fluttered as she placed her hand in his. He led her to the dance floor and pulled her close. His embrace was warm and intimate, and she felt at home in his arms. As the song built to the emotional chorus, Mark gazed into her eyes. “You look stunning tonight,” he said softly. Emma blushed, overcome by the intensity of the moment. The rest of the party faded away as they swayed together, two souls connecting through the poetic lyrics and melody.  

When the song ended, Mark whispered in her ear, “Come over tonight.” Emma didn't hesitate. They tumbled into his bed, passion overtaking them, holding onto the magic they had found on the dancefloor. 

In the early morning light, Emma awoke still enveloped in Mark's arms. She knew in that moment she had fallen for him completely. As she gently kissed his lips, he stirred and smiled at her. "Good morning, beautiful." 

For the next three months they were inseparable, forming the kind of deep, all-encompassing bond that happens once in a lifetime. Emma had never felt so seen and understood. She gave her heart to Mark entirely, dreaming of a lifetime together.

Until the day he ended it without warning or reason. The breakup stunned Emma. How could the man she loved so fiercely toss her aside just as suddenly as he had swept her off her feet?  

A single tear rolled down Emma's cheek at the memory, her latte growing cold on the table. She knew she had to stop rehashing the past, but the song had a way of transporting her back to that night when everything still seemed possible.  

 As the final notes faded out, Emma took a deep breath and steeled her heart. She stood up and walked out of the café without looking back, once again burying the memory of Mark and the part of herself she had lost two years ago on the dancefloor. It was time to find someone new, someone who wouldn't leave her heart in pieces when the music ended.
