Dear Mom and Dad, 

We made it to the Grand Canyon! What a spectacular sight. The vastness and beauty of it is hard to put into words. We watched the sunrise this morning and saw the colors change and light up the canyon walls. Truly an experience I'll never forget. Off to Las Vegas next, wish us luck!

Love, 
Jenny

Hey sis,

Las Vegas is bonkers. So many flashing lights, endless buffets and casinos as far as the eye can see. We saw a couple Cirque du Soleil shows which were incredible. I even won $200 playing blackjack! By the end of the day though, the excessiveness of it all was a bit much. I think we're ready to hit the road again tomorrow morning. Heading west into the desert, talk soon!

Dear All, 

Made it to Death Valley today. It's stunning but brutal - over 120 degrees! We hiked in the morning before it got too hot but still had to turn around after a couple miles in. After lunch we drove through Artist's Palette and Badwater Basin. The colors and rock formations are otherworldly, I've never seen anything like it. The desert scenery looks like a painting. Exhausting but amazing day. Heading into the Sierra Mountains tomorrow for cooler weather. Miss you!

Love,
Jenny

Mom and Dad,  

Greetings from Sequoia National Park! We're camping under massive redwood trees, some of the biggest in the world. We saw General Sherman, the largest tree on earth. Driving through the park and seeing those gigantic trees bursting out of the forest was humbling. Did some hiking through the groves and by alpine lakes. Nice to be out of the heat and enjoying nature. I can see why John Muir loved this area. Heading to Yosemite tomorrow, the views just keep getting better!

Love you!
Jenny & Chris

Dear Family,  

Our last postcard! We made it to Yosemite Valley today and it did not disappoint. Waterfalls, granite cliffs and stunning vistas around every turn. We hiked to the top of Yosemite Falls for a picnic lunch with panoramic views. A perfect ending to our road trip adventure. Months of anticipation and over 2000 miles later, this trip gave us memories that will last forever. Time to start the long drive home! We'll see you soon.

Love, 
Jenny and Chris
