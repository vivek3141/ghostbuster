The old mortician sighed as he put the finishing touches on the corpse in front of him. Mrs. Johnson looked peaceful at last, her wrinkled face softened in an eternal slumber. 

He had been working as a mortician for over 50 years now and had long since lost count of the number of lives he had restored. His ability to resurrect the dead came with a heavy price—for every life restored, a year was shaved off his own. At 83, he felt the weight of those missing years in his tired limbs and foggy mind. But he didn’t regret a single life brought back.

As a young boy, he had been obsessed with the idea of resurrection and life after death. He spent hours reading stories of revivification and poring over ancient tomes on alchemy and magic. His parents wrote it off as a youthful fancy, a curiosity that would fade with age and wisdom. They had no way of knowing their son possessed a rare and dangerous gift.

The first life he restored was his dog Max, who was struck by a car in front of their family home. As the 13-year-old boy wept over the body, a surge of energy passed through him into the still form. Max’s eyes fluttered open, his little chest rising once again. The boy was too overjoyed at getting his best friend back to question how it had happened.  

A few years later, the mortician’s gift revealed itself again when he was able to revive a fellow student who had collapsed at school. This time, however, the effort left him drained and weakened for days. He realized there was a cost to restoring life, even if it was not yet clear what that cost might be.

As word of his ability spread, people came begging him to revive their loved ones. He tried to refuse them, but found he couldn’t stand to see others suffer with loss like he had as a boy. And so, he honed his craft and opened his doors as a mortician who could guarantee return to life. For a price.

Over the decades, he had built up a sizable fortune from his work and gained notoriety as something of a miracle worker. But the more lives he restored, the more his own dwindled. His children and grandchildren had tried to make him promise to give up his ability, worried he would drain himself into nothingness. He smiled at their concern but carried on; how could he stop when he still had lives to save and work yet unfinished?

The mortician sighed once again as he covered Mrs. Johnson with a sheet. His work here was done, but another soul called out for revival. There were always more souls. 

He knew he didn’t have long left in this world, only a few resuscitations left before he breathed his last. But when Death came calling at last, he would not go gentle into that good night. His gift may have cost him in years but bought him a lifetime of purpose. And for that, he was ready and willing to pay the ultimate price.
