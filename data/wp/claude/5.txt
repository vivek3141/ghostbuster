The mountain stood still and large beneath the Warrior. It had not trembled in the days since the people chose him as their Champion. 'Perhaps the Dragon slumbers yet,' he thought. 'I shall wake him, soon enough.'  

He strode forward, heavily, in his iron raiment, shining dully in the morning sun. The shrouded peak drew slowly nearer as the sun climbed the sky, mirroring the Warrior's toil this day as the last. The Dragon slept silently in its lair amidst the clouds.

With each step, old doubts and fears rose unbidden in his mind. His hands tightened on the hilt of his sword, knuckles white beneath the gauntlets. The trek was long and hard, but at last he stood at the entrance to the Dragon's den, a mere crack in the rock face belching smoke.  

The Warrior rasped his sword from its sheath, the ring of metal on metal echoing ominously across the mountainside. He filled his lungs and shouted with all his might, "Dragon! Your Champion is here! Come forth and meet your end!”

The ground shook beneath his feet as a roar erupted from the cave, hot sulfurous breath billowing out. An eye emerged, aflame and ancient, reflecting the Warrior's determined face. “You disturb my rest, fool. Now you shall feed the flames!”

A torrent of fire burst from the cave, engulfing the Warrior. But his armor held fast, glowing red as his Charge relic shielded him from harm. The Dragon emerged fully, claws scraping rock, and snapped at the Warrior. 

He swung his sword with a mighty cry, cleaving scales from bone. The Dragon reared back in pain and fury. And so they clashed - the Champion of men against the scourge of the mountain, as the sun crossed the sky and the people below waited with bated breath for their fate to be decided.
