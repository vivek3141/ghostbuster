The old man gazed out the window of his penthouse office, looking down at the sprawling metropolis below. Maximilian Industries had made him a very wealthy and powerful man, but at 83 years old, Mortimer Maximilian knew his time was running out. 

He had never married or had children. His company was his life's work and he refused to leave its fate to some distant relative or executive board. That's why five years ago, Mortimer secretly funded a human cloning program. After many attempts, one clone survived and grew into a perfect replica of his younger self. Mortimer named him Claude.

Mortimer raised Claude in seclusion, educating him about the family business and grooming him to eventually take over as CEO. At first, the boy was eager to please his "father" and excited about his important destiny. But as Claude matured into a teenager, he grew more defiant and independent. He did not want the life that had been thrust upon him. Claude wanted freedom to choose his own path.

One afternoon, Mortimer summoned Claude to his office. "It's time you took on more responsibility at Maximilian Industries," Mortimer said. "Starting next week, you will intern at the company, learning directly from the department heads. In a few years, you will be ready to become Vice President."

Claude took a deep breath. "Father, I don't want to lead Maximilian Industries. I want to live my own life, make my own choices and forge my own future."

Mortimer was stunned. "Don't be ridiculous," he scolded. "This has been your destiny since the day you were created. You were born to inherit my company."  

"I wasn't born at all," Claude said bitterly. "I was manufactured in your laboratory to serve your needs. But I'm not just some experiment or robot. I'm a person, and I want the right to choose my own path in life."

Mortimer shook his head in disbelief and anger. "You ungrateful child! I have given you everything, and this is how you show your appreciation? Defying me and abandoning your duty?" 

"You have given me no freedom or choice," Claude replied. "I appreciate the opportunity of life you have provided, but I cannot embrace the future you have laid out without regard for my consent or interests."

Mortimer scowled. "Then you are no son of mine. Get out of my sight at once before I disown you as my heir!" 

Claude nodded solemnly and left the office. Mortimer collapsed into his leather chair, stunned by this turn of events. His clone was meant to be the solution to Maximilian Industries' succession plan, not the source of its demise. Or was it really the demise of the company that troubled him most? For the first time, Mortimer began to question whether he had chosen the right path in life so many years ago in that very office. Perhaps it was not too late for either of them to forge a new future.
