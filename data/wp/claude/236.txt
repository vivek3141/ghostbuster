The Pain That Lingers 

The pain started with a stubbed toe when I was five years old. It was just a normal childhood accident, but the pain didnâ€™t fade like it should have. My toe throbbed for days, weeks, months. My parents took me to doctors but none could determine why the pain persisted. They could find no injury or ailment to treat.

As the years passed, more pains emerged and stuck with me. A scraped knee while learning to ride a bike. A papercut from turning the page of a book. Minor inconveniences and injuries, but the pains collected and compounded, creating a chronic ache throughout my body. Simple tasks became difficult as the accumulated pain weighed on my every movement. 

By the time I was a teenager, the pain was unbearable. I could barely walk, let alone engage in normal activities with friends. My life narrowed to a singular focus of managing the pain. My parents devoted themselves to my care, desperately searching for anything to relieve my suffering. Experimental treatments and exotic painkillers were all temporary measures. The pain always returned as intense as before.

In my twenties, I retreated from the world completely. Strangers thought me elderly as I hobbled around with a cane and wore layers of clothing year-round to keep any errant sensory input from causing a new pain to emerge. By this point, my body was a roadmap of hurts real or imagined. There was no way to distinguish between the two - all pain felt uniformly real and overwhelming.

My life today, if you can call it that, is spent in near isolation. I live in a padded room, attended by nurses who see to my basic needs. Their touches are gentle but still the slight pressure of blood drawing or IV replacement adds another layer of stinging misery. The world outside exists only through my small television screen, a reminder of what life remains for most others.

Doctors have theorized my condition is a result of a misfiring in my brain and nervous system. For reasons unknown, my body never developed the ability to stop perceiving and transmitting physical pains after the initial injury or stimulation passes. My rare disorder has no cure and little treatment to offer beyond palliative measures to make the pain slightly less acute. Though research continues, most in the medical field are pessimistically resigned that my lifelong buildup of pain is a life sentenced to be suffered until the end. 

Trapped within the prison of my frail frame, I long for an escape from this ceaseless torment. In my dreams, I discover a method to peel away each pain as if withdrawing threads from a worn garment. I wake bereft as my slumber fantasy fades, realizing it was just a temporary reprieve. The pains snap back into place, resuming their chorus of anguish without mercy. In my darkest moments, death seems a sweet release, the only means of attaining lasting peace and solace at last. For now, I endure - caught between life and its litany of sorrows with no end in sight. Such is the fate when every pain felt builds without relief.
