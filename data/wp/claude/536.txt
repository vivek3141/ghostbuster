I had never been particularly religious growing up. My parents believed in God in a casual way but we rarely went to church or prayed at home. So I reached my mid-twenties without ever sincerely praying or asking God for anything. 

One night, I was feeling lonely and sorry for myself. I thought of all the times in my life I could have used divine intervention. What if there was a God, and he granted one prayer to each person if asked? What if everyone else had wasted theirs when they were younger, not realizing the opportunity? 

In a moment of desperation, I kneeled by my bed and prayed. “God, if you’re there, please give me a sign. Please make the sun rise earlier tomorrow, as my sign.” I felt silly after saying it, but I had nothing to lose.

The next morning, I awoke with the sunrise as always. Disappointment washed over me at the foolishness of my actions the night before. God did not exist, or if he did, he did not bother with the requests of mortal men. 

I went through my day as normal, not giving my prayer a second thought. It wasn’t until the evening when a friend called and asked if I had watched the beautiful sunrise that morning. I scoffed, saying the sunrise was as always. 

“No,” he insisted, “The sun rose at least 30 minutes earlier today. It was stunning. I watched the whole thing. Didn’t you notice?”

My heart leapt in my chest. “I...didn’t look at the sunrise today,” I stammered. I made an excuse to get off the phone and pulled up news reports and data from weather instruments. Sure enough, the earth had rotated slightly faster, causing the sunrise to occur earlier than predicted across the entire hemisphere. Scientists could not explain the anomaly.

In that moment, staring at the evidence on my screen, I knew. God had heard my prayer and made the sun rise early, just as I had asked. Tears of joy and wonder streamed down my face at the implications. God was real, and he had granted my prayer in a way I could not deny or dismiss, giving me a sign I had requested. I smiled, breathed a deep sigh of relief, and said, simply: “Thank you.” My lonely days were over. I was not alone.
