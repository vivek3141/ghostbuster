Scooby-Doo and the Gang Investigate Arkham Asylum  

"Like, this place gives me the creeps Shaggy!" Scooby-Doo whined as the Mystery Machine rattled up the winding road to Arkham Asylum. 

"Reah, rinks razy!" Shaggy agreed, clutching Scooby tightly. 

Fred, Daphne and Velma had decided it was time to investigate the rumors of strange noises and lights coming from the abandoned old asylum on the edge of town. Something weird was going on, and they were determined to find out what.

As they pulled up to the imposing iron gates of Arkham, a bolt of lightning flashed across the sky, illuminating the Victorian brick building. Scooby and Shaggy gulped.

"Jinkies, this place has a dark history," Velma said. "It was shut down decades ago after reports of inhumane experiments and inadequate living conditions."

"And now there are rumors it's haunted," Daphne added with a dramatic shiver. 

Fred pushed open the creaky gates and they cautiously made their way inside. An owl hooted and the wind howled, slamming a door somewhere. 

"Zoinks! Did you hear that?" Shaggy squeaked. Scooby trembled.

They explored the decaying halls by flashlight, cobwebs clinging to their clothes. A loud crash made them jump.

"W-w-what was that?!" Daphne gasped. They turned a corner and spotted a glow coming from under one of the doors.

"Look, a light!" Fred exclaimed. "There must be someone in there. Hello?"

No answer. Fred grabbed the handle and they burst into the room. Inside was an old laboratory, full of scientific equipmentâ€”and there, cowering by a smashed beaker, was a man in a lab coat!

"J-j-just leave me alone!" he stammered. "I only want to continue my experiments!"

"Your experiments?" Velma asked. 

"Dr. Victor Fries," the man muttered. "I must complete my life's work. Now get out, before it's too late!"

"Fries? Like in Mr. Freeze?" Daphne said. 

"Zoinks, he's gone nuts!" Shaggy cried. 

"Rah razy rcientist!" Scooby agreed.

Just then a familiar high-pitched laugh echoed through the halls. 

"The Joker!" the gang exclaimed together.  

"Fools! He's helping me perfect my formula to freeze all of Gotham!" Dr. Fries cackled.  

"We've got to stop them!" Fred announced. The gang sprang into action, chasing the sounds of sinister laughter through the twisting corridors of Arkham Asylum. After a frenetic chase, they finally cornered The Joker and Mr. Freeze in what looked like an old electroshock therapy room.  

"It's over!" Velma declared. "We caught you red-handed planning to freeze the city!"

"Curses, foiled again!" The Joker snarled. 

"And we would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you meddling kids!" Mr. Freeze shook his fist.

"It looks like the only madness in Arkham Asylum was your crazy scheme!" Fred proclaimed.

The police soon arrived and took the villains into custody. "Gotham is safe thanks to you," said the chief of police. "How can we repay you?"   

"We're just glad we could crack this chilling case!" Daphne said. 

"Now, time for some Scooby Snacks!" Shaggy cheered.   

"Reah, rakos!" Scooby barked.

And the Mystery Machine rolled away down the hill under the light of a bright new moon, away from the empty hall of Arkham Asylum.
