I woke up with a strange tingling sensation all over my body. I felt different, like something had shifted in my core. At first, I shrugged it off and got ready for my day as usual. 

On my way to work, I stopped at the coffee shop. As I handed a $5 bill to the barista, he gave me a puzzled look. "But you gave me $20 yesterday and told me to keep the change. Don't you remember?" I had no memory of that and insisted I only owed $5 today. But when I checked my wallet, there was a $20 bill missing. Strange.

At work, I joined the meeting that had already started. My coworker looked at me in confusion. "Weren't you just here a minute ago?" I shook my head. I was late today, I explained. He frowned but didn't argue.

All day, little things like this kept happening. People remembering me saying or doing things I had no recollection of. Almost as if I had been in two places at once. But that wasn't possible. Was it?

On my way home, I stopped by the park and sat on my favorite bench, enjoying the warm breeze. An old man was there feeding the pigeons. "Back again?" he asked. I gave a noncommittal smile. He nodded at my hands. "And no ring today either I see. Does that mean you're in some kind of time loop?"

I froze in shock. "What are you talking about?" The old man laughed. "One day you sit here with a wedding ring, the next without. You keep switching back and forth. I've never understood why, but I suppose it's not for an old man to question."

My head spun. Was this all real? Or was I going crazy? I thought back to the tingling I felt this morning. Whatever had caused that seemed to have also given me some kind of ability to warp reality. To change little details and events by sheer will or whim. I smiled at the realization of this power, even as a feeling of dread sat heavy in my stomach. With a power like this, what exactly was reality? And what might the consequences be of changing it?

I took a deep breath and closed my eyes. When I opened them, the park was empty. Had I erased the old man from existence? I couldn't be sure. But I knew one thingâ€”I needed to learn how to control this gift, and use it responsibly. Or else risk losing my grasp on reality altogether.
