Akron returned to his room, another day gone and he was no closer to finding work. He was a good swordsman, but the army had just dismissed a legion of good swordsmen back to a kingdom who did not need a single one. 

He sank onto the lumpy mattress of his rented room above the tavern, the familiar sounds of revelry below providing unwanted company. His armor and blade, once a source of pride, now only reminded him of his uncertain future. He had given over a decade of his life to the King's army, surviving border skirmishes and outright battles, only to find the peace they had won left no place for him.

He might have found work as a Night Patrolman had his unit been in one of the companies nearer home when the war was over. As it was, he and likely most of his brothers in arms were living on tabs and promises of payment that seemed less likely to be fulfilled with each passing day. The tavern keeper had been generous, but Akron was beginning to wonder how much farther he could make his 'soldier's honor' stretch.

The next morning, Akron rose early and donned his armor, the well-worn leather and dented plates feeling like an old friend. He made his way to the training yard, hoping that the captain of the city guard might give him a chance to demonstrate his skill and earn a place. However, when he arrived, he found over two dozen men already there with the same thought.  

As each man stepped forward to spar with the captain, Akron's heart sank further. They were good, some nearly as skilled as he, and with peace, even the city guard did not seem to need new recruits. By the time it was his turn, the captain had dismissed over half the men as not up to standard. Akron faced off against the man, summoning the determination that had kept him alive on battlefields. The clash of training swords rang out, and Akron pressed the captain hard, using all his wiles to penetrate the man's defenses. 

After a fierce exchange, the captain held up his hand. "You fight well. Had I any positions to fill, you would earn one today. Alas, the city has need of few swords at present."

Akron swallowed hard as he nodded, the ache in his arms nothing to the weight in his heart. It seemed honor and skill meant little in a kingdom at peace. His future was as uncertain as ever, the life of a soldier all he knew, yet now a life without purpose or place. As he walked away from the familiar ring of swordplay, the city stretching before him, he realized with grim clarity he had no path left to follow.
