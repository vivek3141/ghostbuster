I walked through the revolving doors of the gleaming skyscraper, ready to start my first day of work at the tech startup I had just joined. I approached the reception desk, where a smartly dressed woman looked up, her eyes widening.

“Good morning, sir!” she exclaimed. “How may I help you today?” 

I was taken aback by her overly enthusiastic greeting. “I'm here for my first day of work. I was hired as a software engineer.”

The woman looked confused. “Oh, my mistake. I thought you were...someone else.” She quickly made a phone call, speaking in hushed tones.

Within minutes, a man strode up, extending his hand. “Welcome to Anthropic, sir. I'm Robert, the CTO.”

“Nice to meet you,” I said. “But I'm just here as a new software engineer. I think there's been some confusion.”

Robert's smile wavered. “Of course, my mistake. Let me show you to your desk.” 

He led me to an expansive corner office with floor-to-ceiling windows. “Here is your office,” he said. I blinked in surprise. As an engineer, I expected a cubicle, not an executive office.

“I think there's been a mix up,” I said. “I was hired as an engineer, not an executive.”

Robert frowned. “I apologize. Let me check on this right away.”

He left, and I wandered down to the engineering department, introducing myself to a few curious coworkers along the way. They greeted me enthusiastically, commenting how thrilled they were that I was taking such an interest in their work. Their puzzling responses left me increasingly befuddled.  

Finally, I found an empty cubicle and settled in to review orientation materials. A while later, Robert rushed in, looking relieved to find me.  

“I am terribly sorry for the confusion," he said. "It seems an internal email went out saying the CEO himself would be going undercover today to do a surprise inspection. When you arrived, everyone assumed you were the CEO. I sincerely apologize for the mix up.”

My bafflement turned to amusement at the ridiculousness of the situation. I started laughing, and Robert joined in. 

“Quite an interesting first day,” I said. Robert nodded.

“Welcome to the team,” he said. “Despite the chaos, I have a feeling you'll fit right in.”

“Thanks,” I replied. “Though I hope the CEO doesn't actually come for a surprise visit, or this could get very confusing!”

We laughed again, and I turned my attention to actual work, ready to start my unexpected adventure as the accidental CEO.
