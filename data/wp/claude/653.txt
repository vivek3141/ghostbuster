The Vow of Death 

Jenna gripped Mark's hands tightly, as the priest calmly said the final words of the marriage rite. “You are now joined for life, in sickness and in health, till death do you part.”

As Jenna looked into Mark's eyes, the enormity of those words hit her. In this universe, marriage vows were not just symbolic. When one spouse died, the other would instantly perish as well. They had chosen to wed, knowing the consequence.

The guests erupted into cheers as they kissed for the first time as husband and wife. Despite the celebratory atmosphere, Jenna couldn't ignore the knot of anxiety in her stomach. 

The first years of marriage passed in a blissful whirlwind. Mark's zest for life helped Jenna overcome her initial fears. They pursued dreams and adventures together, traveled the world, started a family. 

But joy was often tinged with worry. Mark's high-risk hobbies, a dangerous job, even a contagious disease, any of these could end two lives instead of one. Jenna urged Mark to avoid peril when possible, though she was careful not to smother his lively spirit. She hoped their precautions and good fortune would grant them a long lifetime together.

When their children were grown, health issues started to emerge. Jenna's weak heart and Mark's kidney disease were managed, but underscored their vulnerability. Medical care could only delay the inevitable.  

Lying in bed one night, Mark squeezed Jenna's hand. "I have no regrets, you know. We chose this, and I'd do it again in a heartbeat."

Jenna nodded, blinking back tears. "I always thought the fear of losing you would outweigh the joy of having you. But I was wrong. A lifetime with you, however long, will always be worth it."

They lived another decade, treasuring each moment, until the double funeral that made their vow of death complete. In life and beyond, their remarkable love endured. The risk of eternal loss showed them the value of each day together. By binding their lives so inextricably, the world ensured they would never take that gift for granted.  Their story became a bittersweet inspiration to all.
