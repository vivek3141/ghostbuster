The knock on the door startled me. I wasn't expecting anyone, least of all Sheriff Banks. I opened the door with a sense of dread.

"Sorry to bother you, Hannah, but I have some news about your brother, Jacob." The Sheriff removed his hat, a gesture that meant nothing good. "There was an accident at the mill. I'm afraid Jacob didn't make it."

I stared at him in disbelief. Jacob, my younger brother, was dead? He was only fifteen, just coming into the prime of his life. How could this have happened?

My stepparents were distraught when they heard the news. My stepmother Claire clung to my father Ezra and wept bitterly. Ezra looked stunned, his usual stern expression gone. They had taken Jacob in as their own when they married my mother a few years ago, after my father died of influenza. Now Jacob was gone too.

We buried Jacob next to my mother in the little cemetery behind the church. The minister said comforting words about God's plan and eternal life, but little solace could be found in them. I returned home with an emptiness inside and a growing suspicion.  

Within a few months, Ezra and Claire were acting like their usual selves again. Almost too quickly, I thought. And then a surprise: they were adopting a new baby boy to "fill the void left by Jacob." It seemed peculiar to me that they could replace one son just like that. A feeling of unease came over me.

I thought back to when my mother was still alive. Her death from scarlet fever three years ago had been a shock. Claire came into our lives right away to "help out" as a nurse, and before I knew it, she and Ezra had married and taken over running the farm. At the time I was too grief-stricken to question it. Now looking back, their haste seemed sinister.

The final straw came when the new baby, Thomas, died suddenly in his crib at only three months old. My stepparents were inconsolable, acting as if they had lost their own flesh and blood. Their grief seemed inauthentic to me, as if performed for show. An awful realization struck me: they had built a habit of marrying widowers and adopting their sons, only to systematically get rid of them one after another. The deaths were too coincidental to be accidental. 

Panic building inside me, I knew I had to get away. I packed my bags in secret, stealing away in the middle of the night. As I glanced back at the little farmhouse one last time, I shuddered at how close I had come to sharing the fate of the others. My stepparents may have replaced their sons easily, but I was determined not to be replaced again.
