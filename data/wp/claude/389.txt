The old scout ship rattled as it entered Earth's atmosphere. Zlorb looked out the front viewport with anticipation. After decades of planning, the Gorcian armada was finally invading the little blue planet.

Zlorb turned to his crew. "Prepare for landing. Activate cloaking devices." The crew tapped at their consoles, activating the energy shields that would bend light around their ship, hiding them from Earth's primitive technology. 

The scout ship landed in a large field, the long grass hiding their craft from any passersby. Zlorb and his soldiers marched out, their metallic exoskeletons creaking and hissing with each step. Zlorb raised his arm, checking the controls on his forearm. "Atmosphere is breathable. Activate language assimilation devices."

There were clicking sounds as tiny implants in each Gorcian's brain were activated, nanobots flooding their systems to pick up the local language from scans and broadcasts. Within minutes, they would be fluent, ready to invade in secret.

Zlorb pointed at a farmhouse in the distance. "There. We start there. Capture the inhabitants for questioning. Move out!"

The Gorcians marched up to the house, weapons raised. Zlorb knocked on the door. A human male answered. "Hello?" 

Zlorb smiled, hoping it seemed friendly. "Greetings, human. We come in peace."

The man's eyes widened as he saw the Gorcians and their weapons. He screamed. Zlorb scowled, this was not going as planned.

Zlorb stormed in with his soldiers, grabbing the man and a woman who appeared. "Silence! We mean you no harm. We only wish to ask some questions."

The man stammered in terror, "Wh-who are you? What do you want?"

"We are explorers from a distant world," Zlorb said. "We seek information about your planet so we may establish an exchange of knowledge."

The man's face paled. "Y-you're aliens? An invasion?"

"Do not be alarmed," Zlorb said. "We come in peace." He turned to a soldier. "Establish a psychic link. Extract what we need."

The Gorcian placed his hands on the man's head. His eyes glowed for a minute.  Then the light faded.

"It is done," the soldier said. "I have mapped the locations of their leaders and weapons. Their technology and defenses are primitive. We will easily conquer them."

Zlorb grinned, mandibles clicking. "Excellent. Return to the ship and relay this to the fleet. Earth will soon belong to the Gorcian Empire!"

The scout ship rattled as it exited Earth's atmosphere. Zlorb watched the planet grow smaller, anticipating their return, and an easy victory. The Earth would never see them coming.
