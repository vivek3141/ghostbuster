The old house creaked as the wind swept through the trees outside. At night, when everything was dark and silent, the creaks and groans seemed louder to Emma. She lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, watching the moonlight filter through the curtains and cast shadows that seemed to dance and waver. 

Emma strained her ears, listening for any sound that seemed out of the ordinary. But she heard nothing but the sounds of the old house settling in for the night. Her imagination started to get the better of her. What if there was someone else in the house? What if she heard soft, stealthy footsteps making their way up the stairs and down the hall toward her room?

Emma's heart raced as her mind conjured up the possibilities. She threw off the covers, leapt out of bed and rushed to turn on the light. The room was empty. She let out a sigh of relief. Her imagination had played a trick on her again. She knew there was nothing to be afraid of, yet at night, in the dark and silence, her fears always seemed more real. Emma left the light on, crawled back into bed, and eventually drifted off to sleep, the familiar sounds of the old house creaking her back to a place of comfort.
