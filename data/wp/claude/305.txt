I slowly opened my eyes as consciousness returned. But something felt off. This wasn't my room. The walls were an unfamiliar pale blue color and the furniture was not my own. Where was I?

Panic started to rise in my chest as I realized I had no idea how I got here or where "here" even was. I swung my legs off the side of the bed and stood up, only to freeze in place at the sight before me. 

There were 5 other people in the room, but they all looked like...me. Different versions of me. 

One was a woman with long dark hair, but with my same eyes and nose. Another looked similar but was clearly of Asian descent based on their features. A third figure was in a wheelchair, and gave me a small wave and sad smile. My pulse raced as I tried to make sense of what was happening. Alternate universe versions of myself? How was this even possible?

I opened my mouth to speak, but no words came out. I didn't even know what to ask or say in a situation like this. The others seemed to understand my confusion and panic, as they looked at me with empathy.

The woman spoke first. "I know this is frightening. We all went through the same confusion when we first arrived here. But we mean you no harm." She had the same voice as me, just in a higher feminine pitch. 

"Where are we?" I finally managed to ask. "What is this place?"

"We don't know," the Asian man replied. "It seems to exist outside of space and time as we know it. One by one, we were brought here, seemingly at random, and from what we can tell we are all alternate versions of you from parallel universes. But as for why or how, we remain in the dark."

I stared at them, dumbfounded. This couldn't be real. I must still be asleep in my own bed, in my own universe, trapped in some bizarre dream. I blinked a few times, hoping to wake up, but the room remained. 

The man in the wheelchair spoke in a gentle tone. "We've been here for different lengths of time, ranging from a few days to over a year. But we have learned to live together in relative peace. You are welcome to join us, for as long as you are here."

"But I want to go home!" I blurted out. Panic started rising in me again at the thought of being stuck in some strange parallel world for an extended period of time, cut off from everything and everyone I knew. 

"As do we all," the woman said with a sigh. "But none of us have discovered a way out yet. Believe me, we have tried everything we could think of."

I sat down heavily on the edge of the bed, my head in my hands. This couldn't be happening. There had to be a way back to my own world, my own life. But at the same time, a part of me was fascinated to meet alternate versions of myself, to see how we were the same yet how circumstances had shaped us all so differently. 

One thing was for certain though - I wasn't going to give up hope. I would find a way home, no matter what it took. Home, and my own universe, were out there waiting for me. I just had to figure out the way back.
