I sighed, the wooden sword pinging incessantly off my adamantium ankle bracelet. Another new player, eager to make a name for themselves in the underworld by taking down a high level enemy. I turned, the ground trembling under my boots, and peered down at the offending gnat. 

He gazed up at me, eyes wide behind his iron helmet, and gulped. His sword arm fell limp to his side. I had a reputation that preceded me, and my ominous black armor, glowing crimson eyes, and twin axes that crackled with violet energy, did nothing to reassure the whelp.

"Begone from my sight, insect," I rumbled, my voice like thunder. I turned back to the River Styx, intent on continuing my patrol for souls attempting to escape their damnation. The incessant pinging started up again. I rolled my eyes. The gnats never learned.

I whipped around, snarling, "Have you a death wish, fool? I am Grimm, end-game boss of the underworld, destroyer of champions, and slayer of gods. My power is beyond comprehension and my wrath shall fall upon you like a--"

"Actually, Mr. Grimm, sir," the player squeaked. I blinked. Mr. Grimm? "I was hoping you might consider helping me level up. I'm having trouble fighting even the basic skeleton mobs. I can't complete any quests on my own and the game isn't much fun. Do you offer any training or mentoring services?"

I gaped at the tiny figure. In all my centuries overseeing the underworld, none had dared ask for my help. Let alone address me so informally. I ground my teeth. The gall! And yet...I had been growing bored lately. Perhaps tutoring a protege, an underling to pass my knowledge onto, would relieve the tedium. 

I crouched down, bringing my face close to the whelp. He trembled but held his ground. Admirable. "You have courage, mortal, I will grant you that." I bared my fangs in a skeletal grin. "Very well. I shall train you. But know this - I am a harsh master, and if you prove unworthy of my time, I will not hesitate to return you to the void from whence you came. Do we have an understanding?"

He nodded vigorously. "Yes, Mr. Grimm sir!"

I sighed. The "Mister" would have to go. I held out one massive, clawed hand. "Take my hand, mortal, and your journey to power shall begin."  The little gnat grasped one of my claws, his whole arm barely reaching around it. Perhaps this wouldn't be so tedious after all. The corners of my mouth twitched. My first protege. Let the lessons begin.
