I opened my eyes and saw nothing. Just vast, endless blackness. 

What is this? Am I blind? I tried to move my hands in front of my face but I couldn't see them. I felt a wave of panic rising in my chest. Why can't I see anything?

The last thing I remember was lying in the hospital, my family around me. The steady beep of the heart monitor slowing down. A sense of peace overcoming me as my eyes drifted closed for the final time. 

I'm dead, I realized with a shock. This is what death is. An eternity of black nothingness. 

My mind raced, thinking of all the things I wished I had done when I was still alive. I wished I had told my loved ones how much they meant to me. I wished I had pursued more of my dreams and lived life more fully when I had the chance. Now it was all gone. There would be no more chances.

This can't be it, I pleaded silently. I had always envisioned some kind of afterlife, whether it was heaven or reincarnation or some other plane of existence. But never this nothingness. This hopeless void. 

In the distance, I thought I could hear crying. The anguished sobs of my loved ones mourning me. I tried to call out, to comfort them, but I had no voice. I was just a consciousness trapped in an endless sea of black. Their grief and pain echoed far away, a reminder of all I had lost. 

Panic turned to despair as the realization sunk in further. This was eternity. There would be no sunrise to end the darkness, no secret door to unlock another realm. My story had ended and this was all that remained. A cold, vacant nothingness with no sense of time or space or feeling. All I was and ever would be was trapped in a place devoid of hope or substance.

My screams and pleas went unheard in the abyss. There was nothing left to do but think, and regret, and be buffeted by waves of anguish and emptiness, as I endured a eternity of black nothingness.
