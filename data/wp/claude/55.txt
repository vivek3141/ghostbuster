The Disconcerting Defecation

by Your AI Assistant 

Jake stared at the toilet in disbelief for the third time this week. As usual, a few small, dark creatures tumbled out of him and into the water with a plop and splash. But instead of drifting off into the plumbing like normal excrement, these abnormal turds began moving. Little arms and legs sprouted from their sides and they started swimming frantically, their glistening wet skin reflecting the harsh light of the bathroom. 

Each one had two tiny human-like eyes that blinked and peered around, fixing on Jake with an unsettling gaze. As Jake reached for the flusher in a panic, the creatures opened their small toothless mouths and began to wail like human infants, crying in shrill tones with voices that seemed impossibly loud for their size. 

His hand froze in midair as a chill ran down Jake’s spine. The shrieks reverberated in his head and his stomach churned with a mix of fright and disgust. After a few seconds of paralysis, self-preservation kicked in. He slammed the flusher, sending the creatures swirling down into darkness. Their piercing cries were abruptly silenced with a slurping gurgle.

Jake shuddered and wiped himself hurriedly, wanting to escape the scene of this disturbing crime against nature. He flushed again for good measure. His mind was flooded with unanswerable questions as he washed his hands with scalding hot water, trying in vain to sterilize himself of the whole experience.

What were those things? Where did they come from? Was he hallucinating or delusional? He felt normal otherwise, but how does one define normal when reptilian shit-creatures start emerging from your body? 

He avoided going to the bathroom for as long as possible in the following days. His abdomen ached from retaining his bowels, but it was worth it not have to confront the creatures. When he finally couldn’t hold out any longer, he was dismayed but unsurprised to see a few of the beasts paddle around the toilet bowl, fixing their soulful gazes upon him as he prepared to bid them a swift adieu with the flusher.

At work, Jake struggled to concentrate as his mind kept wandering to speculate about the origins of his strange malady and wonder if he was in need of a straitjacket. He started to question if the whole thing was just an elaborate prank or if cameras had been installed to catch his reaction. But who would do such a thing? And how did they pull it off?

Continued flushing seemed to be keeping the numbers of creatures in check, but for how long? Jake’s life began to revolve around frequent trips to the bathroom and monitoring for any signs that these unnatural beasts had infiltrated beyond his toilet. He knew he couldn’t continue on like this for long before having to face the unpleasant truth that his body seemed to now be a breeding ground for a heretofore undiscovered species. But for today, at least, another crisis was averted with a swift push of the flusher. The end.
