I peered through the scope of my rifle, lining up the shot on the balcony of the Berghof. In the distance, I could see the familiar figure of Adolf Hitler enjoying the morning sun, surrounded as always by his officers and attendants. 

My finger tensed on the trigger. This was the moment I had trained for, the chance to take the shot that would end this madness and save millions of lives. But I hesitated. Killing Hitler had become too easy, too predictable. As last year's champion, I had a reputation to uphold, and simply shooting him from afar wouldn't earn me any points for creativity or difficulty. I sighed and lowered my rifle.

The judges in the future demanded more and more spectacle and drama with each competition. Last year my elaborate scheme to poison Hitler's vegetarian meal at a state dinner had barely edged out the flamboyant contestant who parachuted onto the roof of the Reichstag, fought his way through guards armed with futuristic weaponry, and confronted Hitler man to man before dealing the fatal blow. The audiences across time periods have become jaded with every variant of a sniper's bullet or time-bomb. They crave the unexpected, the preposterous.

An idea began to form in my mind, audacious yet ludicrous enough to satisfy the thirst for hyperbole and shock value. I packed up my rifle and hiked back down the mountainside, heading into the nearest village. There, in a dimly-lit tavern, I used what little remained of my dwindling funds to purchase a rusty old hay wagon and a crate of apples.

Two nights later, I parked the hay wagon on the side of the winding alpine road a mile from the Berghof. In the distance I could see the faint glow of lights as the usual revelry ensued within the Nazi compound. I turned the wagon so it blocked the entire road, piled hay bales in a wall across the span, and emptied my crate of apples onto the ground around the wagon. Finally, I waited in the bushes, watching and listening.

It was almost midnight when I heard the approaching engine of a staff car, no doubt ferrying some officer back to his quarters after enjoying one too many schnapps at Hitler's party. The car came flying around the bend, only to smash into my hay-wagon roadblock at top speed. The collision shattered the windshield and bent the vehicle's frame, flinging open the doors. The driver and passengers, bruised and dazed, stumbled out of the wreckage. 

And at that moment, out of the darkness, I triggered the release on the secret panel in the wagon floor. A massive iron cage came crashing down, trapping the men inside. Angry shouts and frantic struggling ensued, growing louder as the men finally recognized the sole item occupying their cramped prison.

For there, in the center of the cage, was a small tufted eagle owl, its bright yellow eyes peering at them with what seemed a rather sinister intent. I strode over to the cage, smiling at their shocked faces. 

"Gentlemen," I proclaimed, "may I present to you Adolf Hitler's killer. By this time tomorrow, your beloved Fuhrer will be dead, felled by the venom of a pygmy owl's poisonous bite."

A hush fell over the group as they stared in horror at the unassuming little bird, imagining the headlines that would soon spread through the Reich. My work there was done. I had, in the end, assassinated Hitler without laying a finger on him. Let's see the judges deny me points for creativity this time.
