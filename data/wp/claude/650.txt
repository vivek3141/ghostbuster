The Harvest 

Jake tossed and turned in his bed, unable to sleep. His mind was racing with worries and anxieties about his job, his relationships, his unfulfilling life. As his restless mind jumped from one concern to the next, a strange feeling crept over him. A feeling that his struggles and suffering were somehow being cultivated and fed upon by sinister forces. 

He shook off the bizarre thought and glanced at the clock. 3:33 am. The witching hour. Jake didn't actually believe in such superstitions, but the timing seemed oddly fitting for his strange intuition.

His cat, Simba, suddenly awoke with a start and leapt off the bed. The hair on Simba's back was standing up as he stared intently out the open bedroom door into the darkness of the hallway. A chill ran down Jake's spine. He had never seen Simba act this way before. The cat hissed loudly, then darted under the bed to hide.

Jake heard soft whispers coming from the hallway. He strained to make out what the hushed voices were saying, but could only catch snippets. 

"...the distress is reaching peak levels now. We must harvest soon before..."  
"...yes, this one is ripe. His suffering will feed us for..."  
"...the others are also ready. We shall have a feast tonight!"

Jake shook with terror. He pulled the covers tightly over his head as if that would protect him from whatever sinister presences were just outside his door. The whispers grew louder as they approached, unaware that he could overhear them.

"This human's anguish and despair are utterly delicious. His troubled soul shall fetch a high price in the abyssal markets. Our demonic buyers will be well pleased with tonight's harvest!"

Jake's heart pounded as the implications sank in. His intuition had been right. There were malicious beings that cultivated human suffering to feed on souls. They were literal soul farmers, harvesting humanity to sell to the highest bidders in some unholy underworld market. 

The whispers turned into cackles of hideous laughter just outside his door. "Come, come, little morsel! Your time has come. Your soul is ripe for the taking!"

Jake leapt out of his bed as his door flew open with a bang. But no one was there. The cackles rose in volume and intensity, shaking the walls of his room. He screamed in primal terror as he realized the farmers were all around him, unseen, delighting in his anguish and preparing to claim their harvest.

His screams were cut short as an invisible force wrenched his soul from his body. He collapsed lifeless to the floor, his soulless corpse a testament to humanityâ€™s grim purpose - fodder for the insatiable hunger of the soul farmers that toiled in secret to reap their harvests each night. Their sinister laughter echoed through the empty halls of the farmhouse, celebrating another bountiful harvest before they continued onto the next crop of human chattel. And the sun rose again on another day of cultivation in humanity's fields.
