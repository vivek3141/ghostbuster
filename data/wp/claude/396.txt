You discovered a long time ago that you have the ability to change other people's emotions at will. Describe your daily life.  

My name is Emily and at first, I didn't realize I was different. As a child, I thought everyone could sense the emotions of those around them and subtly shift them if they chose. It wasn't until I was a teenager that I realized this was a gift only I possessed.

I can sense the emotions of anyone near me - their joy, sadness, anger or calm. And if I focus, I can amplify or dampen those feelings. Make a crying child suddenly start giggling. Calm a raging co-worker. Lift the spirits of a depressed friend. At first, I used my ability hesitantly, but now it is as natural as breathing.

My daily life follows a simple routine. I wake early, eager to start my work at the local hospital. As an emotional therapist, my job is to help patients process trauma or cope with difficult diagnoses. But my true purpose is using my gift. A few gentle nudges to amplify feelings of hope or ease anxiety can do more than any words I might share. I soak in the relief and gratitude of patients I've helped, which in turn renews my own spirit.

After work, I walk through the park. All around me is an emotional landscape only I can see. A couple bickering on a bench, their anger like flames. A weary mother exhausted after a day with her children, her tired calm flickering like a candle. Two teenagers awkwardly on a first date, their giddy attraction creating sparks of excitement. As I walk, I skim these emotions like fingers across piano keys, playing a melody only I can hear. A tweak here to ease anger, a nudge there to boost joy. I leave the park with a lightness in my own step.  

In the evening, I call my sister. She lives far away and craves these conversations where I can sense her true feelings, even from a distance. We talk for over an hour as I make subtle shifts to brighten her mood or calm her anxieties. She tells me she always feels better after our chats, never knowing why that might be. I go to bed content, my gift used for good and the emotions of the day balanced at last.  

This has been my routine and my purpose for as long as I can remember. I walk the world invisible, a secret gardener caring for the emotions of all those I pass by. It is a gift I use with care and responsibility because for me, every day holds the opportunity to ease another's burden and brighten the world - one feeling at a time.
