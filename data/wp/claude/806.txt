The Three Souls 

Three weary souls trudged up the golden path to the pearly gates of heaven. A stern angel stood guard with a scroll in his hands.

The first soul, a kindly old woman, approached the angel. "Name?" the angel asked.

"Agatha Timmons," she replied.

The angel scanned the list and smiled. "You may enter into the kingdom of heaven. You lived a good, charitable life."

The gates swung open and Agatha walked through, joy flooding her face.

The second soul, a cruel and corrupt businessman, swaggered up to the angel. "The name's William Stark." 

The angel checked the scroll and frowned. "You do not belong here. Your place is in the depths of hell for the evil you wrought."

With a puff of smoke, William disappeared. Screams echoed in the distance.

The third soul, a nervous young man, slowly came forward. "I'm Claude Dumont," he stammered.

The angel searched the scroll repeatedly. Claude's name did not appear.

"There must be some mistake," Claude cried. "I tried to live a good life!"

The angel shook his head. "I do not know why your name is missing. I cannot allow you entry."

Claude collapsed to the ground, sobbing. As his tears hit the golden path, there was a flash of light. An updated scroll appeared in the angel's hands.

"Claude Dumont," the angel read, a smile forming on his lips. "Your name has been added to the list. You may enter into paradise, where you will find eternal joy."

The gates opened once more. Claude gazed in wonder at the rewards of heaven as he finally went through.
