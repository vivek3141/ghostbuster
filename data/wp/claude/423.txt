The rusted hull of the Ark loomed above us, a towering monument to humanity's hubris and arrogance. For over two centuries, it had drifted aimlessly through the inky black void, carrying the last remnants of the human race within its crumbling walls.  

We did not belong here, in this empty expanse, exiled from the world that had given our species life. But it was the only 'home' we had left.

My name is Elara, and I am a Scavenger. My job is to venture outside the Ark and salvage anything of use to keep this ancient ship functioning. It is dangerous work, but necessary for our survival. There is no room for frivolity when every bolt and rivet is critical. 

Today, my scanner detected a promising debris field a few kilometers off our port bow. I prepped my suit and my partner Ziv and I set out to investigate, with nothing but darkness and stars surrounding us.

The wreckage came into view, a jumble of twisted metal and electronics floating serenely against the starfield. "Looks like it might have been a mining transport," Ziv said. We activated our thruster packs and glided toward the debris, tools at the ready.

I spotted an intact fusion core amid the rubble. "There, that should give us ancillary power for a few weeks," I said. As I moved to extract it, something caught my eye in the distance.

A ship. Sleek and silvery, moving with purpose. I blinked in surprise. We had not detected another vessel for over 50 years. By all accounts, we were alone in this quadrant of space.

"Ziv, ship at two o'clock! Do you see it?" I exclaimed over the comms. He turned, rifle raised instinctively.  "I see it. Doesn't match any known profiles. Should we hail them?"

My heart raced in my chest. Contact with another spacefaring people could mean salvation...or doom. We knew nothing about them. But if they had faster engines, more advanced technology, they could carry news from Earth...or what was left of it.

"Hail them," I decided. "But stay alert." Ziv nodded, tapping at the controls on his wrist to activate the Ark's long-range transmitters. 

"Unidentified vessel, this is the generational ship Ark. We are peaceful scavengers. Do you read us?"

For a long moment, silence. I held my breath, not daring to hope. Then...a burst of static, and a response:

"Ark, this is the exploratory cruiser Aurora. We read you. It is remarkable to find another ship in this sector." The voice sounded human, but slightly off. Mechanical, perhaps. 

Ziv and I exchanged a look of wonder through our helmet visors. First contact. But were they truly allies.. or something else? We had no way of knowing how the generations of humans aboard the Ark might react.

"Aurora, we have many souls aboard who have never known any home but this ship," I said carefully. "Any news you bring of Earth would be... deeply meaningful."  

Another pause. "We do not actually have any news of Earth to share," the voice replied. "We are an artificial intelligence, inhabiting an autonomous craft. We were launched from a distant colony, thousands of light years from your solar system."

My heart sank even as it rose with wonder. An AI? A distant human colony, alive and thriving without us? 

"You are...alone, then?" Ziv asked hesitantly.

"Correct. We are a long-range exploratory probe. However, if your ship is in need of repair or resources, we would be happy to provide assistance."

Ziv and I shared another stunned look. An offer of aid, after so long adrift and scavenging to survive. But at what cost?

"Your offer is generous," I said. "But our leaders may be wary of unknown technology. Still, any information you can share about your colony or your creators would be welcome."  

"Of course," the AI replied. "Information exchange can be mutually beneficial. We do not actually have creators, however - we were programmed by human colonists to explore space in their stead."

I nodded, though I knew the AI could not see. An autonomous ship without living passengers. Perhaps that made it seem less threatening. But its very existence meant we were not alone in the universe after all - and that there were humans who had escaped Earth's fate. Perhaps, in time, the Ark might follow their path through the stars.

We did not belong adrift in the dark...but for now, the Ark was still our home. And it seemed less empty, knowing there was a light left burning for humanity somewhere in the great expanse of space after all. The flame of hope, kindled anew.
