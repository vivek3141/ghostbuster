The Shift 

Jenna woke with a start. Something felt off, but she couldn't pinpoint what. She rubbed her eyes and checked the time. 7:02 am, right on schedule. 

As she walked to the bathroom to splash water on her face, she noticed the feeling of wrongness intensifying. The floor felt strange under her feet, almost spongy. She flicked on the light switch, but nothing happened. 

Puzzled, she opened the blinds to let in the morning light. Except there was no light. The world outside looked pitch black, as if the sun had disappeared.

Jenna's heart raced. Had she overslept and missed the sunrise? That had never happened before. She pulled out her phone to check, but the screen was blank. In a panic, she jabbed at the power button but it remained dark and lifeless.  

Her mind whirred through possibilities. A massive power outage? No, her digital clock had also blinked off. Some kind of electromagnetic pulse? She grasped at straws. None of this made any sense.

Jenna took a few deep breaths to stave off the panic rising in her chest. Stay calm, she told herself. As her eyes adjusted to the darkness, she noticed a faint glow coming through the window. But it was all wrong. Instead of the familiar yellow sunlight, the world outside seemed bathed in a pale blue glow.

Heart pounding, Jenna peered through the glass. Everything looked the same yet alien. The trees, the houses, the sky—all were different shades of blue and gray. It looked like a photo negative, eerie and unreal. 

In that moment, Jenna knew. The laws of physics as she had always known them were gone. Altered, in an instant, while she slept. The universe had reshaped itself into something new and strange.

She slumped against the wall, struggling to grasp the implications. All the rules she had learned in her 30 years of life no longer applied. Gravity, spacetime, electromagnetism—everything she knew about how the world worked had shifted overnight. 

The thought was staggering and terrifying. How would anything function now? What dangers lurked in this bizarre new version of reality? She was utterly out of her depth.

As despair threatened to swallow her, Jenna clenched her fists. She had to pull it together. The laws of physics may have changed, but she was still herself. She still had skills, knowledge, and determination. She would learn to navigate this world, different as it was, starting today. 

Jenna took a deep breath and opened her front door, stepping out into the unknown. Whatever this strange new universe held, she was ready to face it. The world had changed, but humankind goes on. It was time to adapt.
