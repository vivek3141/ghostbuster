The dusty surface of the moon stretched endlessly before me as I took my first steps outside the lunar lander. Even through the visor of my spacesuit, the harsh gray landscape seemed utterly lifeless and barren. 

As I walked further from the lander, following the planned exploratory path, something caught my eye in the distance. A strange shape, too symmetrical to be natural. I hurried towards it, my boots kicking up little puffs of moondust with each stride.

As I got closer, I suddenly stopped in my tracks. There before me, battered but still standing, was an ancient flagpole. And hanging limply from it, the faded colors of a flag from a society long forgotten. 

My heart raced. This was impossible. According to the historical records, the first successful moon landing took place over 600 years ago. But here was physical proof that an even earlier civilization had mastered space travel and made it here first.

With trembling hands, I took photographs and scans of the site. This was a monumental discovery that would shock our people. We thought we were the pioneers, the first to set foot on another world. Yet here was evidence of an unaccounted for spacefaring society that had achieved what we thought was impossible in an era lost to the darkness of prehistory.

I gazed up at the inky black sky filled with unfamiliar constellations, at the pale blue marble of Earth suspended above the horizon. A deep sense of wonder and humility filled me in that moment. We were not the first. But now, we had a mystery to solve - who planted this flag, and what became of the civilization that had started this ancient space race? Our future had suddenly become more rich and strange than I ever could have imagined.
