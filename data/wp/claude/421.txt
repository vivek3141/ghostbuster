I had a peculiar talent that I had never shared with anyone. It was mundane yet seemingly impossible. I could wiggle my ears. Not just a little bit. I could wiggle them in circles, flap them up and down, and move them independently of one another. It was a useless skill, so I had kept it to myself all these years.

One night, a group of us were at a party, sitting in a circle sharing amusing talents and stories.  As the tales started getting more outrageous and improbable, I thought this might be an opportunity to finally share my secret ability. When it was my turn, somewhat shyly, I said, “I can wiggle my ears.”

My friends looked at me dubiously. “Prove it,” said Mark. The rest of the circle nodded, clearly skeptical. 

I took a deep breath and started moving my ears, first up and down, then in circles, then independent figure eights. Jaws dropped. For a second there was stunned silence.

“That’s impossible,” exclaimed Jenny. “You have to be faking it somehow.” The others agreed that there must be some kind of trick. 

“It’s not a trick,” I insisted. “I’ve been able to do this since I was a kid.”

“But ears can’t move like that,” Mark said. To my friends, human ears were apparently fixed in place, only capable of detecting sounds, not moving in a complex, controlled fashion.

“I’m double jointed,” I offered as a possible explanation. Still, they remained unconvinced. I got up and turned my head from side to side, demonstrating that my ears continued their acrobatics independent of my head movements. 

“I have a rare condition called auricular hypermobility,” I lied, making up a medical-sounding term on the spot. I had no idea if there was a real diagnosis for my unusual ability. 

My friends were still skeptical but starting to come around. I had one final idea to prove my point. “Here, feel them move,” I said, inviting them each to give my ears a gentle tug to verify they were indeed repositioning themselves in impossible ways. One by one, they took turns grasping my ears, their eyes widening as they felt the animated cartilage under their fingers.

By the end of the night, my secret talent was revealed. No longer mundane yet still rather peculiar, my ear wiggling escapades had become the hit of the party. I was happy to finally share this part of myself, however weird, with my closest friends.
