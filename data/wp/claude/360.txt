The longing for connection, 
An unquenchable thirst.
Each lonely night I ache,
As emotions burst.

I walk the streets at night, 
Searching for my dove.
A kindred soul to end the pain,
And gift me precious love.

A smile, a laugh, a gentle hand,
The warmth of an embrace.
These simple gifts of intimacy,
I long to find your face.

But with each lengthening year,
The hunger grows more grim.
I start to realize the truth,
No one will care for him.

So I take what can't be given, 
Steal what won't be shared.
I have to quench this thirst, you see,
Not meant to be well paired.

Their lives cut short, my thirst abates,
The hunger disappears. 
Their final screams like soothing balm,
Allaying all my fears.

But not for long, it comes again,
This aching, yawning pit.
Another shattered life must end,
For you my thirst I'll slit.

You denizens of love and life, 
Cherish each sweet hour.
There are those like me who walk, 
Craving with manic power.

Give love and be loved in return,
This gift you must not spurn.
There's one like me in the dark, you see, 
Who's lesson you should learn.

Love well and love fully,
At the end that's all we yearn.
Before the hunger rises again, 
And to darkness I return.
