Billy and Duke had been best friends since we brought Duke home as a puppy two years ago. Billy was 4 at the time and desperately wanted a dog. He promised to walk, feed and take care of Duke. I was skeptical but eventually gave in. 

At first, things were fine. Billy dutifully walked and fed Duke. They played together in the backyard. But soon, Billy started preferring Duke's company to friends his own age. Everywhere Billy went, Duke followed. At dinner, Duke sat by Billy's chair waiting for scraps. At night, Duke slept on the floor by Billy's bed. 

Recently, Billy's behavior started changing in disturbing ways. He stopped using a glass and started drinking water directly from the toilet bowl, just like Duke did. When friends came over, Billy insisted on "play fighting" and jumping on them, like puppies do. At the park, he dropped to all fours and chased after other dogs.

My husband and I didn't know what to do. We told Billy that he needed to spend less time with Duke and more with human friends. We banned Duke from the dinner table and put his bed in the laundry room at night.  

One afternoon, my friend Jenny brought her toddler son over for a playdate. The boys were playing Legos in Billy's room. I went to check on them and was horrified to find Billy humping Jenny's son, just as Duke often humped his toys.

Enough was enough. We sat Billy down for a serious talk. We told him that while Duke was part of the family, Billy needed to be around other people. We set strict limits around Dukeâ€”no more sleeping in his room, no scraps at the dinner table. We arranged playdates and activities to get Billy engaging with other kids his age again.

It was a struggle at first. Billy threw tantrums and refused to do anything without Duke. But slowly, he started rediscovering other parts of himself. He made friends at his new football club and at school.  He no longer copied Duke's behaviors and was acting like a typical 6-year-old boy again.

Duke is still Billy's best friend, but they now have an appropriate owner-pet relationship. Balance has been restored. My little boy is growing up, but he'll always have his faithful four-legged companion by his side.
