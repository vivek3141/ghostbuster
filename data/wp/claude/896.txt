The little wolf pup Ruben was the naughtiest wolf in the pack. He was always playing pranks and jokes, causing trouble for the other wolves. His favorite trick was to run into the forest and yell "Boy! Boy!" at the top of his lungs. The older wolves would come running, thinking there were humans nearby. But when they arrived, out popped little Ruben from behind a bush, laughing at his trick.

One sunny morning, Ruben was bored while the rest of the pack slept. He decided to go into the forest for another round of his favorite game. "This will be the best one yet!" he thought. He ran deep into the forest, farther than he had ever gone before. When he was sure he was far from the pack's cave, he took a deep breath and howled as loudly as he could: "BOY! BOY! COME QUICK!"

Within seconds, Ruben heard the pack waking and scrambling into the forest toward the sounds of his howls. He laughed, picturing them crashing through the trees, fangs bared, only to find his trick again. Ruben hid behind a large oak tree, peeking out to see the wolves approaching.

But this time, something was wrong. The wolves looked scared. They were sniffing the air intensely and growling. Ruben suddenly smelled something unfamiliar too - a smoky, musky scent he had never encountered before.

Just then, huge creatures emerged from the forest right behind the wolves. They were unlike anything Ruben had seen before. They walked on two legs, carried long sticks that crackled with a strange orange glow, and wore animal skins.

Humans! Ruben realized with terror that he had called the pack toward humans - their most feared enemy. Ruben watched in horror as the humans raised their sticks and thundering sounds filled the air. Wolves began to fall. His packmates were under attack!

Ruben bolted from his hiding spot, howling in panic. He ran as fast as he could, but one of the humans spotted him and made chase. Ruben could feel the human gaining on him, its thundering stick pointed straight at him.

Just as the human was almost upon him, Ruben felt sharp teeth sink into his tail, pulling him backward. It was his mother! She had found him just in time. Ruben scrambled after his mother, tears streaming down his face, his little legs pounding the earth. They ran until the sounds of thundering and howling faded behind them.

Back at the cave, Ruben saw only half of the pack had returned. The rest had been lost to the humans' attack. Ruben knew it was all his fault. He bowed his head in shame before the pack leader. From that day onward, Ruben never again cried "boy" when there was no boy to be found. He learned the hardest of lessons that day, taught through tears and the loss of those he loved most dearly. Ruben the naughty wolf pup would be naughty no more.
