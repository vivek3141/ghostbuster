The jubilant crowd cheered as Obama delivered his final speech as President. Eight years of progress and transformation, now complete. 

Suddenly, a fiery streak slammed onto the White House lawn, tires screeching. The DeLorean's gullwing doors flew open, and a disheveled Bernie Sanders tumbled out, shouting “Everyone, please, you must listen! There's no time!”

The Secret Service rushed to intercept him. “Stand down!” Obama commanded. “Let the Senator speak.”

Sanders stumbled forward, grasping Obama's hands. “Thank God I'm not too late. There are terrible things coming. Disasters, abuses of power, threats to liberty and democracy itself. But it's not too late - you have to warn people, bring them together, guide the country through the darkness!” 

Obama frowned, concerned for his old friend's sanity. “Bernie, what are you talking about? I'm not President anymore. My time is over.”

“No, no you don't understand,” Sanders said desperately. “I'm from the future. 2024. Things went so wrong after you left office. But now the future is unwritten again!”

Murmurs and confusion spread through the crowd. Obama gently squeezed Sanders' hands.

“Bernie, calm yourself. I cannot lead where the people do not grant me authority. My role now is to follow the nation's chosen path, not to seize some imagined crisis.”

Tears welled in Sanders' eyes. “Don't you see? Your moral authority could save us. Without it, the future falls into darkness and fear.” 

Obama smiled sadly. “The future is not yet written. Have hope, my friend.” He turned again to the crowd, who now watched in awed silence. “The future is yours to shape. Be brave. Stand up for justice, equality and reason. Darkness comes, but light persists, if good people don't give in."
