Well fuck, you actually did it, you managed to take over the world. Now what are you supposed to do? You were joking, it was all a joke dammit!  

Jake couldn't believe his stupid prank had spiraled so out of control. He had built the doomsday device in his garage as a joke, to poke fun at all those over-the-top supervillains in comics and movies. He had never imagined actually using it.

But in a moment of frustration, he had activated the device, sending out a signal that knocked out power grids across the globe. Everything was in chaos. All infrastructure and technology was crippled under an impenetrable electromagnetic pulse. 

In the aftermath, Jake emerged as a hero, giving instructions via his shortwave radio on how communities could band together. He reluctantly accepted the mantle of leadership as grateful survivors pledged their allegiance. In just a few months, his reach had spread across borders, his control cementing over territories and nations.

And now here he stood, supreme ruler of Earth, all because of a practical joke gone horribly wrong. 

Panic welled up inside of him as he gazed out the window of the presidential palace. He didn't want any of this responsibility. He could barely take care of his cat, how was he going to care for billions of people?

There was only one way he could see out of this mess. He walked over to a control panel, entered a familiar code, and took a deep breath. He had made this bed, now he had to lie in it.  

With the flip of a switch, power was restored across the planet. As society rebooted itself, Jake vanished into the shadows, his brief reign over. His joke had come full circle, and the lesson was clear - some things were better left unbuilt.
