The rickety elevator clanked as it slowly descended into the fiery depths. I knew I had reached the gates of Hell. The doors creaked open. 

A blast of hot, sulfuric air hit my face. Before me was a vast, scorched wasteland. The cracked ground glowed orange from the rivers of lava flowing through it.

Demons cackled and circled above, reveling in the new souls entering their domain. Their leathery wings stirred the foul air.

A gnarled, clawed hand grabbed my shoulder and shoved me forward. "Welcome, foolish mortal. You will never again know the light of day." A hideous, fanged beast spat in my face.

In the distance, the tortured screams and anguished cries of the damned echoed. Billows of black smoke rose from the infernos, blocking out any memory of the world above.  

My heart raced with terror and dread. This was to be my eternity. As the door slammed shut behind me with an ominous thud, all hope was extinguished. I stumbled into the acrid darkness of my descent into Hell, alone in a sea of misery, forever lost.

The end.
