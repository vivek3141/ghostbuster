The old warehouse lurked at the end of the abandoned street, holding untold secrets behind its rusty metal door. Jill walked past it every day on her way to school, her footsteps echoing between the decaying brick buildings. She avoided looking at the warehouse, though she couldn't have said why. It gave her a creeping feeling of dread that seemed unreasonable in the light of day. 

One morning, Jill heard a loud crash and a roar coming from the direction of the warehouse. She froze in her tracks, her heart pounding. After a few seconds of silence, she laughed at herself for being startled by some stray cat or falling debris. She continued on her way, shaking off the feeling of unease.

The next morning, Jill again heard a loud noise from the warehouse. This time it was a high-pitched shriek. She walked faster, telling herself she was imagining things. But her imagination couldn't explain the dent in the warehouse door, as if something had rammed into it from inside. 

Jill knew she should tell someone, but what would she say? That she heard noises and saw dents that could easily be explained away? She realized with a sinking feeling that she didn't want to know what was really inside the warehouse. It was easier to ignore it, as the city ignored so many of the secrets it held.

On the third morning, Jill's worst fears were confirmed. She came upon a litter of massive footprints in the dust outside the warehouse, leading to a gaping hole in the door. The footprints were unlike anything made by a normal animal. She followed them with her eyes, her heart in her throat, cold dread stealing over her. She knew now that no one would believe her. The monsters were real, and one had escaped.

Jill quickened her pace to get past the warehouse, breaking into a panicked run. She raced to school and went straight to her teacher, breathlessly reporting that there had been a break-in at the old warehouse. Her teacher regarded her with a patronizing smile. "I'm sure it was just some stray dog, Jill. No need to let your imagination run wild."

Jill insisted, tears of frustration springing to her eyes, but it was no use. No one would listen. She realized with anguish that the truth would remain hidden until it was too late. The city had turned a blind eye to monsters for so long, it could no longer recognize one even as it stared it in the face. And so no one would mourn until the deaths began, and the monsters could no longer be ignored or explained away.
