I opened my eyes and was surrounded by a strange misty grayness. There were no shapes or shadows, just an empty expanse in all directions.  Am I dead? I thought. Where am I?

"You're in the space between," said a voice. It sounded like my own inner monologue, but externalized and autonomous. "Between heaven and hell," it continued. "This is the realm of the undecided soul."

"Who are you?" I asked aloud. There was no mouth moving, just a voice speaking in my mind. 

"I'm a manifestation of your deepest conscience and subconscious. I have taken form here to judge whether your soul is fit for heaven or hell."

I felt a deep pit form in my ethereal stomach. My fate rested in a strange psychic construct of my own mind? 

"Please," I thought, "I have tried to live a good, moral life. I don't deserve an eternity of suffering." 

The voice laughed. "It's true, you avoided the major sins and misdeeds. But goodness is more than just the absence of evil. Did you actively spread joy and compassion in the world?"

I faltered. I had lived a life avoiding harm, following the rules, not rocking the boat. But had I really made a positive difference to others?

"You see," said the voice, "you coasted through life in a haze of mediocrity. You fulfilled your obligations but never aspired to true virtue and grace."

A lump formed in my throat. Or rather, I experienced the sensation of a lump forming. I had no physical body here, I realized. I was pure consciousness - and the voice was a personification of that consciousness. Pleading my case to myself would get me nowhere. I had to change from within.     

"You're right," I admitted. "I could have done more. I could have spread more kindness and joy. I coasted through life when I could have truly made an effort to lift people up."

"And why do you think you deserve heaven now?" The voice was stern and unmoving. 

"I don't," I said. "But I want the chance to do better. To go back and truly live according to my highest self. I want to earn heaven, not just ask for entry."

There was a long pause. "That is a start," the voice said finally. "But intentions and promises mean little without action." 

"I understand," I said. "If I promise to live selflessly, to spread compassion, and to seek real virtue, will you grant me the opportunity?"  

"I will send you back," said the voice, "and your truest self, your soul, will remain here to watch and judge your actions. Make the virtuous choice each day, act with kindness even when difficult, spread love and joy at each opportunity. Do this for one lifetime, and your heaven shall be earned."

Before I could reply, I found myself in my body again, gazing up at a bright blue sky and the tree branches swaying above me. I took a deep breath, filled with a strange mix of fear and hope and determination. My life's work was before me. I sat up, filled with a clarity I had never known in life, ready to finally live according to my higher self each and every day. My fate depended on it.
