The shadows lengthened as the sun dipped below the horizon. Jake sat motionless on the park bench, lost in thought.  

It turns out quantum immortality is a fact of nature, and you're the only person who is aware of every time you die.

This realization had haunted Jake for years. He remembered the car crash when he was 17 that should have killed him. The tumble down the stairs at 22. The cancer diagnosis at 37 that mysteriously went into remission. 

Each time, his consciousness continued in a parallel world. But no one else knew. His secret was a lonely one.

Jake gazed at the passersby hurrying to dinner, blissfully unaware of the ephemeral nature of their existence. For them, life moved in a single stream, unbroken. They didn’t wake in the middle of the night, heart pounding, as memories of other lives, other deaths, crowded their mind.

A jogger ran down the path in front of him. In another world, Jake thought, I died on that operating table. I’ll never take any of this for granted.  

Jake rose and walked toward home, embracing the setting sun's fading warmth, grateful once again for this life he now inhabited. His loneliness was a small price to pay for the wonder of continued being. Every moment a gift to be savored. An eternity to unfold, one world at a time.
