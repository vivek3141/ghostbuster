The lonely two-lane road stretched before me, illuminated only by my dim headlights. I had been driving for hours, far longer than I should have, trying to outrun my restless thoughts. 

As I crested a hill, a familiar melody drifted from my radio. It was "Come Away With Me" by Norah Jones, a song I hadn't heard in years. I turned up the volume, transported back to happier, simpler times.

My heart skipped a beat. Everyone said that you heard this song just once, one minute before meeting your soulmate. I nervously checked the clock - it was just after midnight. I strained to see through the darkness, wondering if another set of headlights would appear. 

The song ended as I descended into a valley. Disappointment washed over me, followed by annoyance at my gullibility. Soulmates and signs from the universe were fanciful notions. I had given up on love long ago.

Yawning hugely, I decided to stop at the next motel. As I rounded a bend, a figure appeared in my high beams, waving frantically. I slowed and opened the window, one hand on my phone in case I needed to call for help.

A young woman,bedraggled and breathless, rushed up to my door. "Please, can you help me? My car broke down a mile back and I have no cell service out here."

I hesitated, wary of letting a stranger into my car so late at night. But I saw real fear in her eyes, and I couldn't leave her stranded. "Get in," I said. "We'll call for roadside assistance at the next town."

She slid gratefully into the passenger seat, hugging herself against the chill night air. "Thank you so much. I'm Jessa," she said, extending a hand. Her fingers, unlike the rest of her, were long, delicate, and cold.

"I'm Anil," I said as my skin tingled at her touch. I turned up the heat and passed her my coat, our eyes meeting briefly. A rush of déjà vu came over me, fleeting but powerful, like sensing an echo of a dream.

We drove onwards into the night, two strangers sharing a comfortable silence. The song on the radio when we met replayed in my mind, a reminder of the unlikeliest of possibilities coming to pass. My head told me it was foolish, but my heart wondered if this was a sign - if soulmates and second chances were real after all.
