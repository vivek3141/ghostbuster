The old cabin sat nestled between towering pines, where two streams joined and calm waters ran deep.  Jack came every summer to fish, escaping the bustle.

One night, a storm rolled in. Heavy rain poured as lightning flashed and thunder boomed. The streams swelled and joined into a raging river. 

Jack woke with a start as water rushed under the cabin. He scrambled out, but the water rose fast, dark and churning. His gear washed away. The cabin shook and started to collapse.

Chest-deep in the freezing flood, Jack was swept away. He grappled for anything to grab onto. A branch snapped. Swimming hard, gasping, he caught a rock and clung as rain pelted his face.

When dawn broke, the waters receded. Jack emerged exhausted. The forest glistened, reborn. His refuge was gone, but life remained. The waters would always run.
