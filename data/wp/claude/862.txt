You wake to the sound of your alarm, hitting the snooze button as always. The daily routine begins. Shower, coffee, commute into the office, meetings, emails, deadlines. The normal hum of life passing you by at a rapid yet steady pace. 

At the end of the long day you make your way home, tired in both body and mind. You fix a simple dinner, watch some mindless TV, and head to bed, ready to repeat it all again tomorrow.  

As you drift off to sleep, your mind begins to wander. At first, you find yourself in the familiar settings of home and work. But soon the scenes start to shift and change. The walls of your house begin to bend and warp into strange shapes. New rooms appear that you've never seen before. Outside the window, the usual view of neighborhood rooftops is replaced by a vast, open sea underneath an expansive sky filled with two suns and a ringed planet looming close by.

You walk through a door that wasn't there before into a long, metallic corridor. Strange symbols and signs line the sleek, curved walls as you make your way down the passage. You come upon a room filled with people, but not any kind you recognize. Some have pale blue skin and pointed ears, others have scaled skin and slit-pupiled eyes, and still others are made of what looks like living stone or wood.  A cacophony of sounds - some familiar tones of conversation, others completely foreign and musical - fill the space.

As you take in this bizarre scene, a figure approaches you. She looks mostly human, except for the pair of iridescent wings folded behind her back. She greets you with a warm smile and a melodic voice: "Welcome. We've been waiting for you. You have many questions, I'm sure, about where you are and why you're here."

You open your mouth to speak, but find yourself unable to form words. Your mind is simultaneously trying to make sense of this strange dream world while also insisting it cannot possibly be real.  

The winged woman continues, "This is no ordinary dream. Your consciousness has drifted into what we call the 'dream verse' - a dimension that exists alongside the waking world you inhabit in your daily life. Here, the fantastical is real and the impossible becomes possible. Your mind has tapped into this realm, and we have called you forth to explore."

"But why me?" you finally manage to ask, your voice sounding small and unsure. 

Her smile widens. "Because you have an open and creative mind. The dream verse chooses those who can accept the strange and unusual without fear or judgement. It will teach you and show you wonders, if you let it." 

She extends an open hand toward you. "Come. We have much to show you."

You look at the proffered hand, unsure of what to do next. Your logical mind says to wake up, escape this bizarre dream and return to the comfort of the familiar. But another part of you, long dormant, stirs with a sense of curiosity and adventure. 

You take the winged woman's hand. She leads you through another door into a world beyond imagination. The dream has only just begun.
