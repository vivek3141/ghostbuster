The Decision 

Mark Stevens was tired of the rampant crime in his city. Every day there were news reports of violent robberies, assaults, and worse. The police seemed powerless to stop the rising tide of lawlessness.  

One night, Mark was working late at his job at the library. As he walked to his car after dark, he was mugged at gunpoint. The young thief took his wallet, watch, and phone.  

That was the final straw for Mark. He decided he had to take action. Not by becoming a police officer—he knew he didn’t have the proper training for that. But he could use his wits and determination to make a difference.

Mark created a disguise to hide his identity. He wore a black coat, gloves, and mask that covered his entire face except for his eyes and mouth. If the criminals wanted to instill fear, then he would give them something to fear. He began to patrol the streets at night, watching and waiting for crimes to happen so he could stop them.

His first night out, Mark stopped a car theft in progress. He snuck up on the thief trying to steal a vehicle and knocked the crowbar out of his hands. “Not tonight,” Mark said. The thief turned, cried out in fright at the dark figure before him, and ran away as fast as he could.

Mark continued his vigilante acts, disrupting robberies and assaults. But his methods became progressively more violent. Criminals ended up with broken bones, stab wounds, and worse. The city began to wonder who this masked man was. Opinion started to turn against the anonymous vigilante. Some saw him as no better than the criminals he tried to stop.

Jenny Griffin was a concerned citizen. She wanted her city to be safer, but she feared this vigilante's extreme methods were only making the violence worse. She began to investigate, hoping to discover the man's identity and turn him into the police.

One night, while peering out her apartment window, Jenny noticed a figure in black sneaking into her neighbor's garage. She called the police, then went to the garage herself. Inside, she confronted the masked man as he held a pair of would-be burglars at gunpoint.  

"Stop right there!" Jenny said. The vigilante turned, startled. The burglars seized the moment to run away and escape.

Jenny stood her ground. "You call yourself a hero, but you're just a criminal like the rest of them. Your violence needs to end before you kill someone."

The vigilante raised his gun. But then he faltered, lowering it again. She was right, he realized. His methods had gone too far. 

Word spread of how a lone woman faced down the frightening vigilante. Soon stories began to emerge of the masked man using non-violent means to stop crimes, and then disappearing as quickly as he came. The mystery surrounding his eventual fate only added to his legend.  

Mark Stevens, now retired from his short-lived career as a vigilante, watched all this with a small smile. His city was turning a corner, becoming a little bit safer each day. And it was all thanks to an ordinary woman brave enough to stand up for what was right.
