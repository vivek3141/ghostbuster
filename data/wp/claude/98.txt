The Ability to Freeze Time

I always knew I was different. Ever since I was a little girl, I had this strange ability - I could freeze time. When I froze time, everything and everyone around me stopped moving. The birds in the sky hung motionless, the bustling traffic stilled, and people were paused in place, footsteps halted and mouths open mid-sentence. 

At first, I thought it was just my imagination. An amusing little game I played. It wasn't until I froze time during a school assembly in third grade that I realized this was no game. After the principal announced a pop quiz, I panicked and time froze. The auditorium became a sea of motionless children and teachers. I walked through the frozen chaos in disbelief. I unfroze time a few minutes later and pretended nothing had happened.

I kept my ability a secret and experimented with it in private. I could choose to freeze certain people so they remained conscious with me. I picked my best friend, Jenny, to include during one of my "time freezes." At first, she didn't believe it was real until I proved time was truly frozen around us. We giggled at the silly faces of frozen classmates and rearranged items in the classroom. For the first time, I felt a sense of belonging. 

One day, during another pop quiz, a bully named Mark was tormenting a shy girl named Amy. As Mark reached out to grab Amy's test paper, I instinctively froze time. Mark's outstretched arm stopped just short of Amy's desk. A surge of confidence arose in me. I walked up to Mark and twisted his wrist backwards, gave Amy her test paper back, then unfroze time. Mark howled in pain, clutching his wrist in confusion. Amy looked at me gratefully. I had used my ability to stand up for someone else for the first time.

While my ability to freeze time is a curious oddity, a part of what makes me different, it is also a gift I can use to help others. I may never truly understand why I have this power, but I can choose to use it responsibly - to pause time, reflect, and act with compassion. For that shy girl Amy, and for anyone else who could use a bit of kindness, I will freeze time.
