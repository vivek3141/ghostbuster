The Addiction of the Ages 

Vekk wiped the sweat off his brow as he maneuvered his cargo ship into the docking bay of Space Station X54. His current cargo was particularly valuable and risky: 10,000 liters of human blood.

Most species in the galaxy found the consumption of human blood intoxicating and highly addictive. The plasma-like red liquid contained a peculiar set of hormones and neurotransmitters that reacted strongly with most alien physiologies, inducing a euphoric high. As a result, human blood had become a highly prized commodity on the galactic black market. 

Vekk had spent the last six months slowly collecting blood from derelict human settlements on rim worlds. It was dangerous workâ€”the human colonies were isolated and paranoid about alien contact. But the payoff for a shipment of human blood made it worth the risk. Vekk stood to make 50,000 glitters of platinum for this shipment, enough to live like a king for a year.

He docked the ship and was greeted by a squad of heavily armed guards. They were hired by the station master to protect valuable cargo like this. "Take it to hold C12," barked their leader, a hulking Drazirian with a nasty scar across his face. 

Vekk entered the specified cargo hold, lit only by a red glow to help preserve the blood. Hideous, pulsing veins lined the walls and a drainage pit occupied the center of the room. This was a consumption chamber, where addicted patrons would pay to experience the euphoric rush of fresh human blood. Vekk connected the massive storage tanks to the veins and machinery in the room, and watched as his precious cargo flowed into the station's restricted access system.  

An hour later, Vekk met with the station master, a wizened old Arcturian named Zelo, to conclude the deal. "60,000 platinum, as agreed," Zelo said, sliding a card across the table. The number flashed on Vekk's wrist computer, his account balance ticking upwards. 

"Always a pleasure," Vekk said. He shook Zelo's bony hand and turned to walk away, eager to spend his newly earned fortune. 

"Vekk," Zelo called after him. Vekk turned back. The Arcturian leaned forward, dropping his voice. "This batch is particularly potent. Tell your suppliers we want more. I'll pay 70,000 platinum next time."

Vekk grinned, sharp teeth glinting. "It will be my pleasure," he said. The addiction was strong, and business was booming. Vekk strode off to plan his next withdrawal from the human veins of the galaxy.
