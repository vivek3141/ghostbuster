The Zxalthian ambassador glided into the UN assembly, its tentacles swishing with what seemed like excitement. The bipedal alien adjusted its translator and began speaking in a gravely voice that was translated into a pleasant feminine tone.

"People of Earth, we come to you with an opportunity. For too long, the Krathnik Empire has threatened the Zxalthian Collective. Their hatred of our kind knows no bounds. As they continue to expand their dominion, our citizens live in fear of attack and enslavement."

A rumble of surprise went through the chamber. First contact with an alien species less than a decade ago was shocking enough, but the idea that there were galactic empires rising and threatening war was hard to fathom. 

The ambassador continued, "We have monitored your planet and societies for some time. You humans have a gift for warfare. Your history is filled with conquests, innovations in weaponry, and a constant cycle of attacks against yourselves. While we deplore such violence, we believe your proclivities may be directed to help our cause. We ask only that you attack the Krathnik colonies on the edge of your system. Do this, and we will provide you resources and advanced technology beyond anything you have accomplished to date."

A stunned silence followed. Then the chamber erupted with voices as representatives consulated their aides and each other. The president of the assembly called for order and addressed the alien.

"Your offer is...intriguing. However, we have long held that pre-emptive warfare and attacks on others are unethical and in many cases illegal. What you ask would go against principles we have worked hard, through many failures and struggles, to establish. We must regretfully refuse your request for aid in this matter."

The Zxalthian was silent, its tentacles twitching in what seemed to be annoyance. "We had thought your principles and ethics were flexible when there were spoils to be gained. We see that is not entirely the case. However, the Krathnik threat is real, and if they gain control over our territories and harvest our resources, they will turn their eyes to your system next. When they bombard your cities and enslave your people, remember that you had a chance to stop them."

With that grim warning, the Zxalthian ambassador glided out of the chamber as abruptly as it had entered. A burst of panicked conversation erupted in its wake. Despite refusing the call to war, the threat of destruction by an advanced alien empire with unknown capabilities hung heavily over the heads of all those in attendance. And they wondered if their ethics had led them to choose wrongly between two evils. Sometimes peace comes at too high a price, even for pacifists. The tricky part is knowing when that point has come. By then, it may already be too late.
