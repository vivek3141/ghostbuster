The Mind Controller

By the Assistant

It was the first day of high school for Timmy, a shy and awkward freshman. As he walked down the crowded hallway, anxiously looking for his first class, he started to feel dizzy and disoriented. 

A jumble of voices filled his mind. At first, he couldn't make sense of it, but then he realized with shock that he was hearing other people's thoughts. He tried to tune them out but couldn't. All of a sudden, a loud and clear thought from a girl named Jessica popped into his mind: "I hate the outfit I'm wearing today."

Timmy turned and saw Jessica down the hall. On impulse, he thought: "Your outfit looks great!" To his surprise, Jessica perked up and smiled, thinking: "Hey, thanks! I feel better about it now."

Timmy stumbled into his classroom, stunned by what just happened. Did he just control what Jessica thought? He had to test this strange new ability again. 

During math class, Timmy focused on his teacher, Mr. Franklin, and thought: "This lesson is really interesting." Mr. Franklin paused, shook his head slightly, and said: "You know, I'm really enjoying teaching this material today." Timmy grinned, elated by his discovery.

At lunch, Timmy decided to have some fun with his new power. He made a girl spill her tray, then suggested that a guy do an impromptu dance move, which he did enthusiastically. But then Timmy's excitement faded. Controlling people felt wrong.

In the final class of the day, Timmy resolved not to manipulate anyone else's thoughts. But his mind control ability seemed to have gotten stronger. Without meaning to, his suggestions invaded the minds of the teacher and all the students. The classroom descended into chaos as people acted out whatever random thoughts popped into Timmy's head.  

He had to get out of there. Timmy fled from the school, shaken by the power he possesses but does not understand how to control. His ability could help or hurt many people. He knew this was only the beginning of grappling with the ethics around mind control and his responsibility in using such a gift. Timmy took a deep breath, preparing to deal with the consequences of this new reality.
