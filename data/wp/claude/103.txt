Jenna was nervous as she walked onto the set. She had done hundreds of scenes in her successful career as a porn star, but this was the first time she was doing a "do a fan" scene where she would meet and film with a fan contest winner. 

When she walked in, she saw him - Tom, an attractive man with kind eyes and a shy smile. Her heart skipped a beat. She had dated around over the years, but never felt an instant connection like this before. 

"Hi, I'm Jenna. You must be Tom, the winner of the fan contest. Congratulations!" she said, extending her hand. When their hands touched, she felt sparks fly. 

"Wow, thanks! I'm a huge fan. I can't believe I get to do a scene with the Jenna Jameson!" Tom said, his eyes widening.

As they discussed the scene, Jenna subtly flirted with Tom. She brushed against his arm, gazed into his eyes and found excuses to touch him. However, Tom did not seem to react. 

When filming began, Jenna's advances became more brazen. As they kissed passionately, she slipped her tongue into Tom's mouth. She pulled him closer, moaning with pleasure. But Tom remained focused on the task at hand, seemingly oblivious to her true feelings.

The director yelled "cut!" and the scene ended. Jenna felt devastated. How could she have been so wrong about the connection she felt?

Tom turned to her. "Wow, you're an incredible actress. For a moment there I really felt like you were into me!" He laughed. 

Jenna's face fell. Her advances hadn't been an act - but Tom assumed it was all part of the show. The chemistry she felt was real, but tragically would remain unrequited. Such, she thought, is the doomed romance between a fan and a fantasy.
