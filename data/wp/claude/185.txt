The cold metal of the table stung my back as I slowly regained consciousness. I blinked a few times, my eyes adjusting to the dim light of the room. Where was I? How did I get here? I tried to move my arms and legs but they were strapped down tightly.

Panic started to rise in my chest. For 25 years I had evaded capture by the police with painstaking precision. As a serial killer, I was meticulous and careful. I never left clues or evidence behind. The cops had no idea I even existed. 

Yet here I was, strapped to a table, completely helpless. How had this happened? My mind raced through the possibilities. Had I gotten sloppy with my latest victim? Had someone seen me and reported me to the police? No, that wasn't possible. I would never have allowed that to happen. 

Just then a speaker crackled to life. "I see you're awake," a distorted voice said. It seemed to be coming from a speaker in the ceiling.

"Who are you?" I demanded. "What do you want?"

"I have been watching you for some time," the voice replied calmly. "You have quite the fascination with death, don't you? 25 years and not a single clue left behind. I must say I'm impressed."

My blood ran cold. This person had been observing me for years without my knowledge. How was that possible? I was meticulous in what I did. There were no witnesses, no one to see me in the act.  

"What do you want from me?" I asked again, struggling against my restraints. They didn't budge. 

"I want to play a game," the voice said. "For 25 years you have meticulously hunted your victims. Now, I shall hunt you. If you can escape this room, you are free to go. But if I catch you...well, let's say you'll experience the fear and pain you have inflicted on so many others."

With that, the speaker cut off. My mind was racing. How had this happened? How had someone managed to apprehend me without my knowledge and hold me captive here? And how was I going to escape this twisted game of cat and mouse? After 25 years being the hunter, I was now the hunted. And I had a feeling this mysterious captor would show me no mercy. The game was on.
