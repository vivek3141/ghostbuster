The interrogation room was cold and bare. A single lamp hung over the metal table, harshly illuminating my cuffed hands.

Detective Smith sat across from me, a thick file on the table between us. My file. He opened it slowly and cleared his throat. "We have enough evidence to put you away for life. Multiple counts of murder in the first degree." He paused, steepling his fingers. "If you cooperate, tell us the details of your first killing, we'll take the death penalty off the table."

I leaned back in my chair, contemplating. My first kill had been a lifetime ago. Before the thrill had worn off, before the compulsion set in. I wasn't sure if I wanted to revisit that memory, to stir up what had started it all. 

But self-preservation won out. "It was a girl named Amanda, fifteen years old. Red hair, freckles. I saw her walking to school one morning. Something about her caught my attention." I swallowed hard. "I followed her into an alley and hit her over the head. When she woke, I had her tied up in my basement."

The detective's face was impassive, but his knuckles were white on the file. I continued, the words spilling out now in a rush. 

"I kept her for three days. After she died, I realized I had found my calling. The thrill of the hunt, the high of the kill. I craved it constantly after that first taste of sweet, teenage blood." 

I leaned forward, making eye contact with the detective for the first time. "You asked for the details of my first killing. But I have to warn you, detective, once you hear them, you can't unhear them. You sure you want to open that particular door into hell?"

He held my gaze for a long, breathless moment. Then he slammed the file shut, leaving my gruesome confession unrecorded. "Take him away." The guards came in and I was returned to my cell, a ghost of a smile on my lips.
