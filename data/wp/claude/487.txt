The old clock on the wall ticked steadily, counting down the minutes to midnight. John sat in his armchair, the only sound in the room the rhythmic ticking of the clock and the rustle of pages as he turned them. 

His wife Jane had gone to bed over an hour ago, as she did most nights. Their routines had diverged many years ago. While Jane was an early riser, John had become more of a night owl as the years passed. He cherished these quiet late-night hours, a time of peace and solitude for reading and reflection.

As John read his book, furrowed in thought, his mind wandered to memories of years gone by. He thought of the lively dinners with friends, nights out at the theater, family vacations with their two young daughters. Images arose unbidden of birthday parties, graduations, weddings. All the moments of joy and sorrow, challenge and triumph that make up a lifetime.

His gaze drifted to the framed photos on the mantle and side tables of the den. Images of the girls as babies, as awkward preteens, as radiant brides. His heart swelled at how they had blossomed into intelligent, compassionate women with families of their own. At least those parts of life had turned out well.

Not all of it, though. There were the painful disappointments, the paths not taken, the unforeseen hardships that life seemed to dole out with indifference. Loss was an inevitable part of the bargain, the price we pay for the deep joy of living. 

With a sigh John closed his book, the words blurring in his tired eyes. He glanced again at the clock, surprised to see how late the hour had become. Time seemed to slip through his fingers like the fine sand of an hourglass these days. 

As he stood up and stretched, his joints creaking in protest, John felt the full weight of his seventy years pressing upon his shoulders. He clicked off the lamp, shrouding the room in darkness as he felt his way to the stairs, climbing slowly step by step towards the soft glow under the bedroom door.
