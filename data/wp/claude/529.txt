The Time Traveler Extermination Squad 

SS Oberführer Klaus Schmidt strode down the dimly lit corridor beneath the Reich Chancellery. Two SS guards stomped to attention as he approached and saluted.

“Report,” Schmidt barked.

“All sectors secure, Herr Oberführer,” one guard responded. “No alerts or disturbances to report.”

“Good. Remain vigilant.” Schmidt continued on. His special division, Task Force Zeit, had one mission: protect the Führer from threats that did not yet exist. 

Deep in the bowels of the massive building, Schmidt entered a stark room. Inside was a glowing orb, roughly two meters in diameter, suspended in mid-air. This was one of the Nazi's most closely guarded secrets--a device capable of detecting disturbances in the space-time continuum.

His team of scientists and technologists continuously monitored the orb, which used exotic particles and electromagnetic fields to sense shifts consistent with time travel. When such a shift was detected, Task Force Zeit would mobilize to eliminate the threat, whether it appeared in seconds or decades hence. They had already quietly eliminated over 600 would-be assassins, hysterics, and time criminals seeking to alter the course of history. 

A shrill alarm rang out as Schmidt entered the monitoring center. Scientists scrambled to controls and displays, shouting incomprehensible readings and coordinates. The orb pulsed angrily, shifting to a scarlet hue.

“Location and time index!” Schmidt demanded. 

One scientist turned, eyes wide. "28 days in the future. Inside the bunker...”

Schmidt's heart seized in his chest. An assassin was arriving in the Führer's private underground quarters, just four short weeks away. 

“Dispatch all units to 28 Tage station immediately! Seal the bunker and deploy advancing countermeasures. Go, go!” 

Soldiers and technicians poured into the corridors and stairwells, ascending in a thundering herd. Within minutes the entire sub-level was on lockdown. The bunker had been transformed into an impenetrable fortress.

Four weeks later, as Hitler began his lunch inside the sealed bunker, a flash illuminated the room. Where empty space had been, there now stood a woman in strange garb, brandishing a bizarre-looking weapon.

In a split second, a dozen pistols and machine guns were trained on her. She looked around in confusion, realizing at once she had erred--but her fate was already sealed. The firing squad opened fire in unison, cutting her down in a thunderous hail of gunfire. 

Silence descended again. Hitler looked at the dead woman on the floor of his bunker, her body riddled with bullets, then to his security forces.

“Remove that from my sight at once,” he said coldly. His life, and his Reich, would endure. The future--any possible future--had been eliminated.
