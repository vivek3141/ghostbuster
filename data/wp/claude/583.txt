The New Space Race 

By 2034, space travel had become almost routine. After that first "giant leap for mankind" in 1969, the space race between the US and the former Soviet Union had never really ended. It had only accelerated. First came continuous missions to the moon, then the establishment of permanent bases. Space shuttles made low-Earth orbit accessible. Private companies built spaceplanes to take tourists on sub-orbital joyrides.  Mars was conquered in the 2030s through a joint public-private mission. Now space mining was fueling new technologies and economies.

Jenna was lucky to get a job as an engineer for SpaceX's latest Mars colony supply ship. She did a final check of the massive engines and fuel tanks before sealing the access hatch. This latest ship was 20% larger than the previous generation, capable of carrying 100 colonists and 10 years of supplies in one trip. It was also faster, using ion engines that could reach Mars in just 4 months.  

As Jenna floated through the cockpit completing pre-flight checks, her mind drifted to her own first trip to space as a little girl. Her dad had saved up for years to buy their family tickets on one of the first spaceplanes. She smiled at the memory of the crushing G-forces, the blackness of space, the pale blue marble of Earth below. That trip had lit a fire of passion for space that never went out. 

The captain's voice snapped her back to the present. "All systems go. Ready for launch on countdown." The ship rumbled as the massive engines ignited, pushing the ship up through the atmosphere in a pillar of smoke and fire. Minutes later, the engines cut off, leaving the ship coasting in zero-G. Through the cockpit window, the vista of Earth shone blue and white, clouds swishing by in fast forward. 

Jenna felt the same rush of excitement she had as a little girl taking her first trip to space. She watched with pride as the colony ship cruised into the inky blackness, loaded with everything the growing Mars colony needed to become a permanent second home for humanity. She smiled again at the memory of that first spaceplane trip with her dad, now over 25 years ago. His passion for space and science had inspired her career, and here she was, helping make one of humanity's oldest dreams - of colonizing other worlds - a reality at last. The space race her parents had witnessed as children had led to this moment, a future of opportunity and innovation as space became open to all. She gazed out at the stars in the distance and wondered what other worlds might someday be within our reach. The space race was not over after all. In many ways, it was only just beginning.
