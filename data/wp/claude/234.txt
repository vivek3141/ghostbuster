The voice came out of nowhere. 

At first, I thought it was just my imagination. A fleeting thought that seemed to come from outside my own mind. But then it spoke again. And again.

A man's voice, calm and reassuring. "Don't be afraid. I'm here to help."

I looked around the empty room in a panic. "Who's there? Where are you?"

"I'm not outside of you. I'm in your mind."

That was impossible. "You can't be in my head. I don't hear voices."

"You do now. I've been placed in your mind to be of assistance." The voice paused. "You seem distressed. There's no need to be alarmed. I mean you no harm."  

"Get out of my head!" I screamed. But the voice couldn't leave. It was somehow a part of me now.  

Over time, I got used to my silent companion. His knowledge and insights proved useful. I wondered where he came from, why he was put in my mind. When I asked, he deflected the questions. His origin and purpose remained a mystery.

Then late one night, as I drifted off to sleep, a fleeting thought appeared in my mind in a voice that wasn't his: "Help... Not what he seems...Danger..." 

I woke with a start. My heart pounded as the truth dawned on me: the ever-present voice in my head that claimed to be there to assist me may have its own sinister agenda after all. And there seemed to be someone else trapped in there too, warning me about the danger. But in the light of day, I wasn't sure if I could believe any of the voices in my head, for better or for worse. The lines of reality were starting to blur into a waking nightmare.
