The old man grimaced as he stared at the plate before him. The repulsive green eggs and ham oozed a foul stench, but he knew he had no choice. 

His captor sneered across the table, madness flickering in his eyes. "Eat up now. I want you to eat them here or there. I want you to eat them anywhere."

The old man shuddered. He remembered the screams emerging from the basement and the mournful cries of his fellow prisoners. His captor's depraved experiments had turned many into disfigured beasts, and some he had then served for breakfast.

With trembling hands, the old man lifted the fork and broke the slimy green yolk of the egg. He gagged as the putrid yolk dribbled down his chin in a mockery of a sunny side up egg.His captor cackled with glee at his revulsion. 

The old man knew refusing to eat would only make his captor angry. He would be the next experiment. His stomach churned as he shoveled a shaking spoonful of the wriggling ham into his mouth. His captor grinned, "There, now isn't that better? Now you've eaten them here and there, you've eaten them everywhere!" 

The madman threw back his head and laughed. The old man clutched his stomach, the room spinning around him. His eyelids grew heavy as the drugs took effect. He slumped forward onto the table with a groan.

The captor smiled and patted the old man's gray head. "Sleep well, my friend. When you wake, we shall have so much fun togetherâ€”so much more green eggs and ham to eat!"
