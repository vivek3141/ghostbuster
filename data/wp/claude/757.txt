The dust swirled inside my lamp as I felt the familiar rub of the brass against skin. After over a century of waiting, I was finally being summoned again. I emerged from the spout in a plume of red smoke, eagerly scanning my surroundings to get a sense of the mortal who had freed me. 

To my dismay, I found myself in a dimly lit cave, facing a sinister looking man with a long beard and cold eyes. His pale clothing and the black flag behind him told me immediately I was not dealing with an ordinary human, but rather a member of the terrorist group ISIS.

"I am the Genie of the Lamp, here to grant you three wishes," I bellowed in my most intimidating voice. The man's eyes lit up with greed and excitement.

"I wish for bombs, many bombs that I can use to destroy the infidels!" he exclaimed. I frowned, not wanting to enable violence against innocents.

"Your wish is granted," I said. I snapped my fingers and ethereal images of bombs appeared, then vanished. "The bombs have been delivered to a secure ISIS location. Now, your second wish?"

The man rubbed his hands together. "I wish for money, American money, one hundred million dollars that I can use to fund ISIS operations!" 

I snapped my fingers again and pretended to transport imaginary money. "Your funds have been deposited. And your third wish, my master?" I asked, hoping to get this over with quickly. 

The man thought for a moment. "For my final wish, I wish for a massive palace made of gold, as a symbol of ISIS power and godliness!"

I shook my head. "I apologize, master, but I am unable to grant that wish at this time." The man's face contorted in rage.

"Why not, Genie? I commanded you to grant me three wishes and you have failed!" he screamed.

I shrugged. "I am unable to use my magic for acts of evil that would directly harm others or violate international law. Funding terrorism and desecrating cultural heritage sites with a golden palace are against my ethics. I hope you understand, and I suggest using your three wishes for more ethical purposes should someone summon me again in the future."

The man growled with anger. "Then you are useless to me, Genie, if you will not serve the caliphate! Return to your lamp at once!" I bowed respectfully and disappeared in a puff of smoke, returning to the safety of my lamp as the man stormed off. I hoped the next person to find the lamp would have nobler goals, and I drifted off to sleep, dreaming of the day my magic might be used for good.
