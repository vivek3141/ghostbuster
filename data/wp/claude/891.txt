The Sky is Green 

The sky was green today. It had been for as long as Jenny could remember. She stared up at the emerald expanse above the crumbling rooftops of her neighborhood. Some days it seemed more yellow-green, other days a deeper emerald. But always that unnatural shade, not the pure blue of her mother's memories.

Her mother told her stories of that blue sky, cloudless and stretching endlessly above the city that was once clean and gleaming. But that was before the war that left the sky scorched and the city in ruins. The war that took Jenny's father. After the last bomb fell, the sky turned green and never went back.

Most of the city was abandoned, left to decay after the inhabitants fled or perished. Jenny's family stayed. Her mother refused to leave the only home she had ever known. They remained in their small house, living off what they could scavenge or grow in their backyard garden.  There were enough abandoned stores of food and supplies to sustain them, as long as they were careful. But with each passing year, as more buildings crumbled and weeds overtook the rubble, the pickings became slimmer. 

This morning, Jenny set out to scour the remains of the old supermarket a few blocks away, hoping there might still be something useful left within its dusty shelves and cobweb-filled storeroom. Anything at all would help. The garden was struggling, their food supplies dwindling down to the last shelf-stable cans and bags.  As she walked down the empty streets, the green-tinged sky seemed heavier than usual, like a moldy cloak of clouds was slowly descending to suffocate what little life remained below.

The supermarket was dim and musty as always. Jenny turned on her flashlight, the weak beam barely enough to cut through the gloom. She headed to where the canned goods were still partially stocked, heart lifting at the sight of some beans and soups still intact. As she filled her bag with provisions, a strange noise drifted through the market—a soft whirring, as of engines. Startled, she froze in place, listening.  There—the sound was coming closer, helicopter blades slicing the too-still air.  

Jenny quickly doused her light and crouched down. No one had seen or heard from the military since they dropped the final bomb years ago. Why would they return now? The old familiar fear and anger swelled in her chest.  Then came a hollow boom that shook the building. A flash lit the front windows, reflecting off walls of dull metal cans. She gasped—they were bombing the city again!

Heart pounding, Jenny crawled to peer through a window.  In the hazy distance, she spied two helicopters circling where her neighborhood used to be, dropping more bombs onto buildings already crumbled into dust and memories. She stared in shock and horror, gripping the window frame to remain upright. Why were they bombing ruins? And then, in a flash of insight, she understood—they were making sure that nothing remained, that no one survived. They were eradicating the last vestiges of what they did, eliminating the witnesses.

The helicopters moved off, their dull roar fading. TheMarket was silent once more, but it was a silence that echoed with smoke and screams. The bombs were a message—the military would return to wipe out the final survivors clinging to their poisoned homes and green, green sky.  

Jenny wavered between fear and resignation.  All these years of struggle and loss, and now they would come again to take even the little that remained. She thought of her mother, still so defiantly hopeful, and knew they wouldn't flee—couldn't flee. This was their home.

She stepped through shattered glass onto the street, gazing at the new plumes of smoke marring the horizon. The green sky seemed brighter, as if fed by flames below. They would come again. And when they did, she would stand by her mother to defend the only thing left to them—the memory of a city once alive under a blue sky. She tucked away her precious bag of salvage and began the walk back home, under a green canopy of consequences.
