The inky blackness of the ocean stretched endlessly below the hull of my submarine. My instruments flared to life as a whale passed by, singing an alien song. I was floating at the mouth of the Mariana Trench, the deepest place on Earth. 

As a researcher, I was fascinating by the strange creatures that inhabit the trench. In my small sub, I descended into the abyss, eager to glimpse life rarely seen by human eyes.

The temperature dropped sharply as I went deeper. Massive pressures squeezed in around me. The feeble light from my sub spotlighted a waving anemone here, an odd translucent fish there. 

Then a low rumble shook through the water. My instruments buzzed in alarm. Whatever that was, it came from far below, deeper in the trench. The rumble grew louder, becoming an ominous roar. The roar of something immense, ancient, and angry.

A dark shape emerged into view, enormous and writhing. Whether beast or natural force, I could not say. It was tremendous, that much was clear. And it was rising swiftly up through the inky black water, right toward me. 

Panic seized my heart. I thrusted levers forward to propel my sub up and out of the abyss as fast as its sputtering engine would carry me. The roaring thing pursued, looming massively behind me, somehow both there and not there in the dark water. I raced for the light above, unsure if I would escape the trench before its depths caught up to me at last.
