The old cottage sat alone at the edge of the forest, decrepit and forgotten. The locals avoided it, wary of the strange noises and lights they saw and heard from within. Rumors spread that a witch lived inside, practicing dark magic and casting evil spells. 

One night, a weary traveler named Tomas stumbled upon the cottage in the dark. He had lost his way in the forest and needed shelter. He knocked on the crooked door, not knowing what to expect.

An old woman opened it, her face wrinkled but her eyes sharp and clear. "What do you want, boy?" she asked. Her voice was stern but not unkind.

"I'm lost and need a place to stay for the night," Tomas said nervously. 

The woman looked him over, then nodded. "You may stay. But do not touch anything, and do not disturb my work."

"Thank you," Tomas said, relieved. The woman showed him to a small but cozy room with a fire already lit. 

In the middle of the night, Tomas awoke thirsty. He left the room in search of water and noticed a soft glow coming from under the door of another room. Strange shadows flickered across the gap. His curiosity getting the better of him, Tomas peered through the keyhole.

The old woman was huddled over a bubbling cauldron, adding ingredients to the pot - was that a lizard's tail? Foul smells wafted through the keyhole as she chanted unfamiliar words. Tomas stumbled back in shock. His host was indeed a witch!

At breakfast the next morning, the old woman fixed her gaze upon Tomas. "You looked into my workroom last night," she said. It was not a question. 

Tomas swallowed hard, caught. "I meant no harm. I was only curious."

"Curiosity is what makes men meddle in affairs they do not understand," she said. "I am not what you think. I do not curse and hex. My potions heal the sick whom doctors cannot cure."

Tomas looked at the witch with new wonder. "Then why do the villagers fear you so?" 

She sighed. "People fear what they do not understand. It is human nature. I accepted long ago that I will live and die alone." She glanced out the window at the forest. "You should continue your journey now. And take care not to spread rumors you cannot prove."

Tomas departed with gratitude and new understanding in his heart. Not all witches were evil, and not all magic was dark. His night in the forest had taught him that things were not always as they seemed.
