It was Christmas Eve and everything was going as planned. The elves had finished making all the toys, the reindeer were rested and ready to fly, and my belly was full of Mrs. Claus's delicious cookies and milk. We began our journey around the world, delivering presents to all the good little boys and girls. 

Around 2 am on the West Coast of the United States, I was feeling quite satisfied with the progress we had made. My sack of presents was nearly empty. But then disaster struck. After a few too many cookies, I began to feel a rumbling in my stomach as Rudolph guided the sleigh over Los Angeles. Before I knew what was happening, I let out a thunderous burp. A huge ball of green gas came spewing out of my mouth straight into the night sky. I gasped, hoping the gas would dissipate, but no, this was no ordinary burp. Within seconds, the entire city of LA was covered in a thick smog of putrid green fog. 

Panicking, I ordered Rudolph to get us out of there as fast as possible. But the damage had already been done. As we flew away, I watched in horror through the rearview mirror of the sleigh. The smog had triggered panic in the streets below. People were evacuating their homes, fearing this was some kind of chemical terrorist attack. The police and fire departments were
mobilizing to handle the "gas leak". My burp had caused complete mayhem and I was responsible.

When I returned home and told Mrs. Claus of the events, she immediately grounded me. I have been forbidden from delivering any presents next Christmas. The elves are livid, as now they have a whole extra year of work ahead of them to make up for all the presents I failed to deliver this year. I have a lot of apologizing to do. But first, I need to call the Mayor of LA and confess - it was me. My name is Santa and [TIFU] by gassing Los Angeles with a burp. I only hope the city can forgive me for the stench I have unleashed upon them. I swear off those cookies for good!
