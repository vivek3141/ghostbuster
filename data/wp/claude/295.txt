The thunder boomed outside as the rain pounded on my windows. It was another dreary Saturday and I was browsing Reddit as usual, upvoting silly memes and streaming videos. As I clicked on another post, there was a blinding flash and a crack of lightning struck right outside my house. The power flickered off for a second, then came back on. 

“Whoa, that was close,” I said to myself. My heart was racing from the adrenaline. I shook my head and went back to Reddit, clicking to expand a new post.

But something felt different. The post seemed to expand on its own, the words and images growing larger and more vivid. Puzzled, I tried to scroll down, but the page moved with the speed of my thoughts. “What the...?”

I tried closing the browser but it wouldn’t respond. The Reddit page was alive, glowing on the screen. I stood up from my chair but then floated up towards the ceiling, drifting around the room like a balloon.

“No way,” I gasped. I focused my mind and found I could direct my floating with a thought. I gingerly made my way back to my computer desk, grabbing onto the chair to anchor myself. 

My Reddit username flashed through my mind - ZeroGravity. I stared at my hands in disbelief. The lightning strike must have done something, giving me the power to manipulate gravity and electromagnetism. I had become ZeroGravity in real life.

A giddy laugh escaped my lips as I floated around the room, tumbling and gliding with abandon. This was incredible! With practice I learned to push and pull the forces around me, changing direction and speed at will.

I spent hours experimenting with my newfound powers. But eventually I grew tired and had to rest. I floated over to my bed for a well-deserved nap.

When I woke, the rain had stopped and golden sunlight streamed through the windows. Had it all been just a dream? I stepped out of bed and nearly tumbled to the floor before catching myself in mid-air. Gravity was still under my control. A huge grin spread across my face.

My life was forever changed from that fateful lightning strike. By day I lived my normal life, but in private I honed my abilities through practice. I had become ZeroGravity, a real superhero with the power to manipulate forces and electromagnetism. And all thanks to a little luck and my beloved Reddit username. The End.
