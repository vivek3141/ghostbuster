The twin suns of Eden rose over the horizon, bathing the jungle in a warm orange glow. Mala awoke to the sounds of nature coming to life for a new day. Exotic birds chirped overhead, small creatures rustled in the undergrowth. 

Mala emerged from her shelter and stretched. She had survived another night on this strange but beautiful world. Three long years had passed since she crash-landed on Eden, but she remained the only human.

As Mala picked strange fruit for her breakfast, she wondered if today might be different. Would she finally discover signs of human life on Eden? Her hopes had faded many times before.

After breakfast, Mala set out exploring as usual. The unfamiliar constellations faded as sunlight filtered through massive trees. Everything seemed normal.

Until a flash in the distance caught her eye. She rushed toward it and found a small escape pod, half-buried in the jungle floor. Her heart raced. She dug furiously, freeing the door, and it hissed open.

A figure lay inside. Mala gasped—it was a man! His eyes fluttered open. They gazed at each other in silence.    

Mala helped him out of the pod. She smiled, overjoyed at her discovery.

The man spoke: “Thank you. I’m Adam. It seems I’ve crash-landed in paradise.”

Mala laughed. “Welcome to Eden, Adam. I’m Mala. And I believe this is the dawn of something new.”
