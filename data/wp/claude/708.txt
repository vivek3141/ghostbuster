Santa and Death both arrive at a young child's house at the same time. 

It was Christmas Eve and Santa was making his usual rounds delivering presents to all the good boys and girls. As his sleigh flew over a small house on the outskirts of town, Santa noticed a faint golden glow coming from the chimney. "How odd," he thought. He landed his sleigh on the roof and climbed down the chimney.

As he emerged from the fireplace, Santa saw a figure in a black cloak kneeling by the Christmas tree. It was Death, gently running his bony fingers through the hair of a sleeping child in the bed across the room.

"Death, my old friend," Santa said. "I did not expect to find you here tonight."

"I come for the child," Death replied softly. "His time has come to an end. I have appeared to take him to the other side."

"No, you cannot!" cried Santa. "It's Christmas, a time for miracles. Please grant this child one more day so he can experience the joy of Christmas morning just once."

Death considered Santa's request. "I see no harm in indulging in the whims of an old friend for a day. I shall return again for the child at the stroke of midnight tomorrow." He gently tucked the blankets around the child and faded into the shadows. 

On Christmas morning, the little boy awoke to find a pile of presents under the tree. His eyes lit up with wonder at the sight of the colorful packages and ribbons. As he opened each gift, discovering treasures of toys, games and treats, the boy laughed with pure delight. 

Santa watched from the window, happy he could give the gift of one more Christmas morning. But as the clock struck midnight, he sadly knew Death would be coming to fulfill his promise. 

The boy was ready for bed now, tired from a day of Christmas joy. As his mother tucked him in and turned off the light, the little boy smiled up at her and said, "What a wonderful Christmas this turned out to be, Mommy. And please thank the man in the red suit and the man in the black cloak for visiting me today - that was the best present of all!"
