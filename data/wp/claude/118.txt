The message flashed across my eyes as soon as I woke up. 

"Your free trial of life has ended. To continue living, please provide payment method."

I blinked a few times, confused and disoriented. What was this strange message in my field of view? I didn't remember going to sleep wearing any augmented reality glasses or lens. Everything seemed normal otherwise in my bedroom. 

I tried to dismiss the message with a wave of my hand but it remained stubbornly in place. 

"This is not a trick or joke. According to our records, your 30-day free trial of life expired today. Please provide payment method to continue living."

My heart started racing. What kind of cruel prank was this? I shouted at the empty room, "Stop this nonsense! I'm not paying anything!"

A new message popped up. "Very well. Shutting down life in 3...2...1..."

My vision went black. I couldn't feel anything anymore. My senses were cut off, leaving me in a dark, empty void.

Panic rose in my chest. Was I dead? Was this really happening? I tried to move my limbs, scream, do anything but I was trapped.

After what seemed an eternity, my senses flickered back on. I awoke with a huge gasp, back in my room, heart pounding and in a cold sweat. 

The ominous messages were gone. Everything seemed normal again. Was it just a terrible nightmare?

My relief was short lived. The familiar message returned.

"We hope you now understand this is not a prank. To continue living, please provide payment method."

I knew with a sinking dread that my 'free trial' of life had truly and absurdly expired. This was my grim new reality. I had no choice but to enter my credit card number to buy another day of life. One day at a time.
