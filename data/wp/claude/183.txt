The black slime moves quickly, coating the walls as you run. You are cornered, turning around to come face to face with a wall of the corrosive goo. A single eye opens in its center, followed by thousands more as tendrils slowly slither towards you.  

Panic rises in your chest as the slime oozes closer, coating more of the walls and floor of the cavern with every passing second. The mass of eyes stare unblinking, filled with an alien malevolence. You have nowhere left to run.

A tendril whips out and wraps around your ankle, burning through your boot and searing your skin. You cry out in pain and fear, struggling to pull free as more tendrils emerge from the slime, grasping at your clothes and limbs. The slime begins to coat your body, enveloping you in a cocoon of searing pain that steals the breath from your lungs.

Within the slime, the thousands of eyes turn as one to gaze directly at your face. An alien mind brushes against your own, cold and unknowable. It rifles through your memories and thoughts with an insatiable hunger, eager to plunder the knowledge within your brain. 

You scream, thrashing against the tightening bonds of slime and tendrils holding you in place, but there is no escape. The slime has you utterly immobilized now, and it begins to creep up your neck towards your face.

A tendril slithers over your mouth, muffling your screams. The slime covers your nose and eyes, plunging you into an inky and terrifying darkness. You feel the slime seeping into your ears, coating your face, an unavoidable invasion. The alien mind in control of this slime hive has accessed your brain. It picks and chooses which memories and thoughts it wishes to consume, discarding the rest.

Your senses fade as oxygen deprivation and the slimeâ€™s anesthetizing effects take hold. The alien mind within the slime withdraws from your crumbling consciousness, its curiosity sated for now. It will continue to feed on your mind and knowledge, unraveling the mysteries within until there is nothing left of the person you once were. You have become fodder for its relentless hunger and a new addition to its sinister hivemind. The slime will spread, and it will consume all.
