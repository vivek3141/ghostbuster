The cold gripped my body as the cryogenic chamber activated, but for some reason my mind remained awake. I could sense the utter stillness of my physical form as my consciousness continued on, trapped in a frozen shell. 

The 8 year journey to Kepler-22b passed in a strange state of dreamless hibernation. My only awareness was of the passing of time through the ship's announcements, noting our progress to the new colony planet. The rest of the 64 crew members were blissfully unaware in their frozen slumber.

Finally the announcement came that we had arrived at the planet's orbit. The ship began the awakening sequence to thaw out the crew, but I alone was aware of every moment. As the icy grip on my body slowly released, my sensations returned one by one. First came sound, the thrumming of the ship's engines and vague voices around me. Then sensations of my limbs, cold and heavy but tingling back to life. Last my vision switched on, blurred shapes coming into focus under the harsh lights of the cryo chamber.

The door to my chamber hissed open, and two crew members peered in. "Welcome back, you're the first one up! We've made it, can you believe it?" said a young woman. Through stiff lips I could only nod, overcome with the surge of emotions from seeing another human face after what seemed an eternity of isolation.

As my body thawed and sensations returned, I said silent thanks for arriving at our new home. While the journey for the others passed in the blink of an eye, for me every day was etched into memory. I alone bore the weight of time spent adrift in the void of space. But now there was soil under our feet again, and a sparkling sun in an orange sky. Our new world was teeming with life, ready to be explored. The frozen ache of deep space travel lifted from my mind at last. We had arrived, and my long vigil was over. Our future was just beginning.
