The old hobos sat by the fire under the bridge, warming their hands. It was a cold night and the two strangers were grateful for the fire.

"Name's Jesse," said one. "Been on the road for as long as I can remember."  

"Call me Luc," said the other. "Not many places left for us these days."

They sat in silence, staring at the flames. "Not an easy life, is it?" said Jesse. Luc grunted in reply.

"Makes you wonder sometimes why God made the world this way," Jesse said. "So much suffering. Doesn't seem right."

Luc looked at him sharply. "And what would you know about God's plan?" he snarled. 

Jesse shrugged. "I just try and do right by people, that's all."

Luc laughed bitterly. "Right by people? When was the last time anyone did right by us?" He pointed an accusing finger at Jesse. "Your God left us long ago."

Jesse shook his head. "He's still here, whether we see him or not. And there's always hope, as long as we've got compassion in our hearts."

Luc peered closely at Jesse and suddenly shuddered. He looked away quickly into the fire again. "You're a fool," he muttered.

Jesse studied Luc from the corner of his eye. A slow smile crept across his bearded face. "Maybe so," he said gently. "But I'll always believe in forgiveness - and second chances."

Luc slowly turned to face him, his eyes burning with a light that had nothing to do with the fire. Jesse gazed back steadily at him. And in that moment, they finally recognized each other.
