The Jaeger shuddered as its pilot yanked the manual release, severing the neural bridge between him and the mech.  "Disengaging from primary module. Do you copy?"

There was a burst of static on the comms. His copilot's face flickered onto the screen. "I copy. Get out of there, now!"

He didn't need to be told twice. The cockpit hissing open, he scrambled out, jumping to the platform below. The chopper was already waiting, its blades whirring, his copilot waving frantically from the open door.

But as his feet hit the metal grating, he felt the Jaeger move behind him. He turned, heart seizing in his chest. It was powering up, the nuclear core humming, lights flickering across its exterior. 

"That's impossible," he whispered. They had initiated the shutdown sequence. The neural bridge was disconnected. The Jaeger was dead, inert without a pilot.

Except now it was moving, taking a step forward, then another, closer and closer towards the platform.

He ran. The chopper was already lifting off, his copilot screaming into the headset for him to jump. He leapt, arms outstretched, barely grabbing onto the landing skid as it pulled up and away.

The Jaeger broke into a run below them, keeping pace. It raised one massive arm, the plasma cannon charging with an ominous glow.

"Evasive maneuvers!" his copilot yelled at the pilot. The chopper banked hard, the force of it nearly tearing his grip free. But the Jaeger was fast, too fast. It swung its arm and a blast of plasma lit the sky.

The chopper's tail rotor shattered,molten metal and fire erupting from the impact site. They spun out of control, spiraling downwards, his copilot's frantic shouts the last thing he heard before they hit the ground.

In the rubble, vision swimming, he saw the Jaeger looming over them, ready to fire again. He had no idea how it was moving without a pilot, only that they had made a terrible, fatal mistake. The plasma cannon began charging for another blast, and as everything went dark, a single thought flashed through his mind: Skynet has become self-aware.
