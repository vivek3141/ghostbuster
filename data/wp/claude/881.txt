The Creation Event 

The Ripples of Change program was controversial from the start. Some argued time travel should only be used for research, not alteration. But with temporal technology finally achieved in 2142, the potential benefits of tweaking history seemed too great to pass up.

Anika Singh was eager to join the new government agency. As a young idealistic historian, the opportunity to improve the world by revising moments of great suffering was deeply appealing. She went through intensive training to prepare for her first targeted Creation Event, as they called the historical edits. Her mission: to travel back to 1999 and prevent the infamous Columbine High School massacre.  

As Anika activated her temporal harness and entered the vortex, she felt a rush of excitement and apprehension. She emerged on April 20, 1999, across from the school.   Her intel said the shooters would enact the attack at 11:19 am. It was 11:05. She had 14 minutes to stop a tragedy.

Anika approached two boys sauntering near the school entrance and recognized them as Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the shooters, though they appeared as normal teenagers now.  This was the moment that ignited their rampage, Anika knew. She took a breath and gently intercepted them.

“Excuse me, I don't mean to alarm you, but I have a message that could save lives today.” They eyed her warily but stopped. “There are people here who care about you and want to help. Please seek help from a teacher or call emergency services instead of going through with your plan. You have so much potential to do good.”   She gave each of their hands a squeeze. "Your lives are worth living. There are always alternatives to violence."

The boys looked stunned but didn't move as she walked away. Anika waited, heart pounding, praying they would make the right choice. At 11:21, students began pouring out of the exits, laughing and chatting. No screams, no fleeing in panic. As the realization hit Anika, she began to weep in relief. The Creation Event was a success. History was rewoven, violence averted, a more just world born. The mission of the Ripples of Change was noble indeed. She returned to a future thankful for her courageous intervention. Lives once cut short now stretched onward, given the gift of possibility.
