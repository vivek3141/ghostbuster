I took a deep breath as the guards escorted me into the execution room. My heart was pounding as I saw the lethal injection table in the center under the bright lights. I had made my peace and said my goodbyes to friends and family. Now the time had come to face my sentence for the horrible crime I had committed. 

The warden was standing by the table, checking equipment. He turned to me with a solemn expression. "Any last words?" he asked. I shook my head. I didn't trust myself to speak.

He nodded to the guards who strapped me onto the table. I stared at the ceiling, blinking against the glare of the lights, waiting for the prick of the needle in my arm.

But it didn't come. The warden leaned down close. "We're not actually going to execute you," he whispered.

I blinked in disbelief. Was this some kind of trick? I gazed wildly around the room but the guards and medical staff were going about their business as if nothing was out of the ordinary. 

The warden slipped a sealed envelope onto my chest. "Inside is a new passport and identity we have created for you. The death penalty was abolished years ago, we just keep up the pretense to deter violent criminals. Someone will be along shortly to release you. You are free to go and make a new life for yourself with a clean slate. But if you ever commit another crime, your real identity will be revealed."

He stepped back and nodded again to the guards. They began to undo the straps holding me down. My mind was spinning. I was being given a chance at life again. A chance to start over and become someone new.

Within the hour, I was walking out of the prison a free man with a new name and identity. I took a deep breath of fresh air and gazed up at the open sky above me. I had been given a rare gift. A chance at redemption. And I was determined not to waste it. I set off to start my new life.
