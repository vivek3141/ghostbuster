The Curse of the Tuneless 

The music swelled as Sara walked down the street, her neighbors bursting into song as a bluebird landed on a branch above them. Sara sighed. It was another musical moment she alone couldn’t participate in. 

Ever since she was a little girl, Sara couldn’t sing. While the rest of the world erupted into spontaneous musical numbers like something out of a Disney movie, she stood there tuneless. At first her parents thought she was just shy. But after years of singing lessons, awkwardly moving her mouth while no sound came out during choruses of “A Spoonful of Sugar” or “Be Our Guest,” they realized the truth. Sara was cursed to be the only person in the world incapable of spontaneous song.

As Sara grew, she learned to fake it, moving her lips with the lyrics to blend in during the frequent musical outbursts at school and work. But she longed to truly belt out a tune and join in the joy everyone else seemed to feel during the musical moments. Sara felt like an outsider, and she knew her lack of singing voice made others see her differently too, their smiles becoming forced in her presence.

One night, as Sara lay in bed listening to her neighbors finishing a rousing rendition of “Our Town” from The Music Man, she made a wish on a shooting star outside her window. “Please, let me be able to sing. I want to join in the music too.” She drifted off to sleep, hoping her wish might be granted by morning.

The next day, Sara hummed quietly to herself, thinking her wish must not have come true. But when she opened her mouth to mutter something to her barista, a few notes came out, then a few more. Startled, she sang out loud for the first time in her life. Her barista grinned and launched into “Good Morning” from Singing in the Rain. Sara joined in, singing in perfect harmony. She had her wish.

Sara spent the day seeking out musical moments, eager to finally participate. But with each duet, chorus, and refrain, she began to feel a bit dismayed. At first, she thought she was just adjusting to experiencing what she had longed for her whole life. But after hours of spontaneous singing with acquaintances, friends and strangers alike, she realized the truth.

While song and music had always brought everyone else together, for Sara it was isolating her. The tunes that so easily fostered connection and joy for others were making her feel more alone and apart than ever before. Her wish had been misguided. Being tone deaf in a world of song was who she was meant to be.  

That night, as a chorus of “A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes” floated through her open window, Sara gazed at the night sky. “I wish to be unable to sing again,” she said softly. And with her heartfelt wish, her singular voice faded once more into silence as the familiar tuneless feeling settled comfortingly into her soul.
