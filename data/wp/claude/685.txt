It was love at first sight. The moment I saw her across the lecture hall, I was enthralled. Her name was Emily and she was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. She had long blonde hair that fell over her shoulders, piercing blue eyes, and a smile that could light up a room. 

We were in the same sociology class in our first year of college. I worked up the courage to ask her out for coffee and to my surprise, she said yes. We talked for hours at that first meeting, discovering shared interests and life goals. Emily was smart, funny, kind, and caring. I had never connected with someone like this before. We began dating and over the next few months, I fell deeply in love with her.

Emily and I were inseparable. We did everything together - studied, ate meals, watched movies, took weekend trips off campus. My friends jokingly called us 'the old married couple' but I didn't care. I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with this amazing woman.

Near the end of our freshman year, I bought an engagement ring. I was ready to propose and start planning our wedding as soon as we graduated. I took Emily out to a fancy dinner, got down on one knee, and asked her to marry me. To my shock, she started crying and said she couldn't marry me. 

Emily confessed that she had been cheating on me for the past few months. She had started secretly dating someone else and had fallen in love with him too. She didn't know how to tell me the truth and end things between us. I felt like I had been punched in the gut. The pain was unbearable.

I cried and screamed at Emily, asking her how she could do this to me. She apologized through her tears, saying she never meant to hurt me. I told her I never wanted to see her again. She begged me to forgive her but I ignored her pleas. My heart was shattered into a million pieces.

That was the end of my relationship with Emily. I did my best to avoid her for the rest of college. The sight of her with another guy made me sick to my stomach. I was heartbroken for a long time but gradually, the pain lessened. I started dating other people but never let anyone get as close as Emily had. 

Ten years later, I still think about Emily from time to time. I wonder if she is happy and if she regrets what she did to me. We could have had an amazing life together but she threw it all away. The anger and resentment faded but when I look back at our relationship, there is still one lingering feeling: and I hate her.
