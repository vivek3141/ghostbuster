The old castle stood atop the hill, dark and forbidding under the gray sky. Sir Gallant sighed as he looked out from the ramparts at the bleak landscape surrounding his home. His armor felt heavy and cumbersome, not because of its weight but because of the weight in his heart.

He was the last of his order. The other Knights of the Silver Shield had died out or drifted away over the long, lonely years. Now only Sir Gallant remained, steadfastly guarding the entrance to the Misty Mountains from enemies that no longer threatened. 

 Sir Gallant went through the motions of his duties. He patrolled the battlements and ensured the gatehouse was secure. He practiced at the quintain to keep his skills sharp, though his reflexes had slowed over time. At night he sat by the fire in the Great Hall, the silence echoing around him as he drank ale and ate stale bread. 
 
His only companion was his horse, Storm, growing long in the tooth but still determined. On the rare occasions travelers passed through, Sir Gallant would venture stories of past glories and battles, though the details felt more like fairy tales with each telling. The travelers never stayed long. They had places to go, people to see, lives to live. 

Sir Gallant wondered why he continued to stay. His oath and duty were to an order that was no more. The king who had charged them was long dead and turned to dust. There were no dragons left to fight, no evil sorcerers to vanquish. Yet the old castle on the hill was all he had known, the only life left to him after so many years of service.

And so each morning, Sir Gallant donned his armor, mounted his faithful Storm, and rode out to defend the entrance to a mountain pass that no one sought to cross anymore. Alone, the last Knight of the Silver Shield stood guard over a kingdom that had moved on without him. His was a lonely vigil, but still he watched.
