I stared out the window of my suburban home at the gathering forces outside. Three police cars, an FBI van, and two unmarked sedans were parked haphazardly around my front lawn. This had all started just a week ago. 

It was a sunny Tuesday morning, and I was walking my dog Buddy around the neighborhood like usual. As we passed by my obnoxious neighbor's ostentatious red sports car, a silly idea popped into my head. I pointed my finger at the car and said "Bang!" pretending to shoot it. To my utter shock, the car exploded into a fireball, the blast knocking me off my feet.

Buddy and I scrambled away from the burning wreckage as a plume of smoke rose up, thick and black. I couldn't believe what I had just done. How was that possible? I had imagined the explosion, but I didn't will it to actually happen. Did I?

Panic flooded my senses. I ran back home with Buddy, hoping no one had seen me. I peeked through the blinds for the rest of the day, dreading a visit from the police. But no one came. I started to convince myself I hadn't actually caused the explosion. Just a freak coincidence, I rationalized. My imagination had gotten away from me.

The next day, I cautiously walked Buddy again, ready to jog away at the first sign of trouble. As we walked past the still-smoldering car wreck, my finger twitched. I looked around to ensure no one was watching before pointing at a nearby oak tree. "Bang!" I whispered. The enormous tree split in half with a deafening crack, falling into another neighbor's yard.

My mind reeled as I realized what I had done. I had some kind of power, activated by imagining explosions with my finger. This couldn't be possible and yet here was the evidence in front of me. I rushed Buddy home, wild scenarios running through my mind. Should I tell someone? The government would certainly want to contain this. I couldn't go to jail, I couldn't become a lab experiment!

In the week since, I'd barely left the house. I was too terrified of what might happen if I pointed at anything else. But hiding away didn't seem to make the problem go away. And now government vehicles were pulling up outside, coming to contain the uncontainable. My strange ability had not gone unnoticed after all. I took a deep breath and steeled myself for what might come next. The power I had discovered was beyond anything I could have imagined.
