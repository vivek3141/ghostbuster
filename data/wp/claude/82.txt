The fire crackled in the center of the makeshift camp as the group of survivors huddled around for warmth. I looked at the scared and tired faces, weary from weeks of running and hiding. As the elected leader, it was my job to keep morale up, but I was struggling. 

We had been on the run ever since the aliens attacked and took over our city. The invaders patrolled the streets, enforcing their harsh laws and crushing any dissent. I tried to rally my people to stand up and fight back, to rebel against our oppressors, but they were too frightened.

"We can't live like this forever!" I urged them. "If we work together, we outnumber the guards. We can overwhelm them and retake our city!"

But still they refused. "It's too dangerous," they argued. "We have families to protect. If we rebel and fail, the consequences will be deadly."

I understood their fears but felt frustrated by their apathy. We were surviving day to day but not truly living. Didn't they want to be free? Didn't they want to risk it all for a chance to defeat the invaders? The difference between slaves and free people was the willingness to fight for freedom. 

As the last embers of the fire died down, and people retreated to their tents for the night, I stayed by the ashes, unable to sleep. I knew I couldn't force them to rebel if they weren't ready. But we couldn't remain hiding in the shadows forever. At some point we would have to make a stand, or accept our new reality under the boot of the alien oppressors. The only question was whether my people would find their courage before it was too late. I hoped so, for all our sakes. Freedom was worth any cost, but only if we were willing to pay the price.
