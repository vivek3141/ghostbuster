The dim light of the interrogation room did little to illuminate the man sitting across from me. His eyes were shadows, his expression unreadable. But his words echoed in my mind with crystalline clarity.

"You see detective; that wasn't the scary part. The scary part wasn't realizing I was the monster everyone thought I was. The scary part was realizing I didn't mind being that monster."

When I first met John Stevens he seemed perfectly normal. A little shy, a bit awkward, but normal. He lived alone, worked as an accountant, kept to himself. His neighbors never suspected that his basement had been soundproofed. That it contained a locked door with something awful behind it. 

The call came in from a concerned co-worker who hadn't seen John for over a week. I volunteered to do the welfare check, expecting to find him sick or injured. Instead, I found a house of horrors. Two women imprisoned in a basement dungeon, malnourished and terrified. And John calmly making dinner in the kitchen, as if nothing was amiss.

He surrendered without a fight, and now here we were. As I studied John across the table, I struggled to reconcile the monster in the basement with the unimposing man in front of me.

"When did it start?" I asked. "The impulse to hurt others?"

John blinked. "I don't have impulses like that. I never wanted to hurt anyone." His tone was matter-of-fact.

"Then why did you kidnap those women? Keep them locked up and starved?"

"It wasn't meant to hurt them. I never tortured or raped them. I just wanted to...have them. Like pets or playthings. I made sure they were taken care of. Fed them, gave them blankets and toys. As long as they behaved." He shrugged, as if this were a perfectly normal thing to do.

I pressed my lips into a hard line, disgust and anger roiling inside me. "That's not right, John. You can't treat people that way."

"No, I suppose not." He sighed. "I know now it was wrong. But at the time...it just felt good. Having that power and control. I liked going down there and seeing them. It just felt right somehow."  

He had finally come face to face with the monster, and the monster didn't care. John's lips curled into a small, chilling smile. "You're right, Detective. I'm just now realizing I don't mind being the monster. And that, truly, is the scariest part of all."
