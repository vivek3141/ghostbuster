The old man next door kept to himself. His aged face was familiar yet I couldn't quite place it. He walked with a limp and rarely left his small cottage.  My cat would often wander into his overgrown yard, and more than once he returned with scraps of food. 

One day, I knocked on his door to retrieve my cat. The old man answered. Up close, his face struck a chord of fear in me. Those eyes...they seemed to look right through me. I stammered an apology and grabbed my cat.

Rushing inside, my memory flooded back. The unbeatable supervillain who had conquered the world, ruled with an iron fist and crushed all dissent. His likeness had been plastered everywhere. Then, he had grown bored and disappeared from public view. Rumors spread of his quiet retirement. 

My cat meowed, snapping me back to the present. I fed him the scraps. Chicken, still warm. The old man must have just fed him. 

Over the following weeks, the old man and I developed a casual friendship. His wit was sharp, his stories captivating. He never discussed his past, and I never asked. I wondered if he knew that I knew. If this was his way of seeking redemption in his twilight years.

One day, he didn't answer his door. The weeds in his yard grew wild. I eventually called the authorities, who found him peacefully passed on. While sorting through his belongings, something caught my eye. An old photo of the supervillain in his prime, with a simple inscription on the back:

“To my only friend, the only one I could not defeat. You were my greatest challenge and my greatest gift. Thank you.”

I wept. The old man had known, and he had won after all.
