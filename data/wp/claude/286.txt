The alert flashed on my screen: "[ST] Flash Prompt in the chat room today! A $20 cash prize will be awarded!"

I perked up. I could use an extra $20. As a freelance writer, any little bit helps. I clicked over to the chat room, where participants had 15 minutes to write a short story based on the prompt "[ST]." As soon as the clock started, ideas began percolating. [ST] could stand for so many things: a secret tunnel, a sinister trap, a scenic trail. My fingers hovered over the keyboard as I debated which direction to take the story.

With only a few minutes gone, I settled on "[ST] Sunrise Trek." The story began unfolding in my mind. I started typing furiously.

The golden sun peeked over the horizon, tendrils of orange and red reaching across the sky. Maya adjusted her backpack and continued trudging up the steep gravel trail, her legs burning. But the beauty surrounding her dulled the pain in her muscles. 

She was hiking up to the scenic overlook, over 4 miles up, for the signature sunrise view. Her friends thought she was crazy for the predawn start, but Maya wanted to witness the dawn exploding over the valley. 

As Maya emerged from the forest, the trail opened up to reveal the vista she had climbed for. The sun glinted off the twisting river below, and the few clouds in the sky were set ablaze with color. She drank in the panorama, feeling peace and wonder wash over her.

In that moment, Maya realized that she had been so focused on forging up the trail in the dark that she hadn't noticed the gradual brightening around her, the details emerging as night shifted to dawn. Her determination to reach the top for the perfect sunrise photo had caused her to miss the quiet moments of simply being and appreciating each phase of the morning. 

Maya knew that when she returned home, no one would understand the profundity of this ordinary sunrise. But that didn't matter. What mattered was that she was here, fully present, watching the birth of a new day. She breathed in deep the cool, crisp air as the sun floated up from its slumber and smiled. The trek had been worth it, just to have this moment.

I finished my story with a minute to spare, proofreading quickly and hitting "Submit" just under the wire. My heart raced with exhilaration at writing a complete short story in 15 minutes. I was quite pleased with how the story turned out, capturing Maya's journey to witness a sunrise that ended up impacting her in a deeper way. Now to wait and see if the judges felt the same and deemed it prize-worthy! The joys and anxieties of a flash fiction contest.
