The darkness of the underworld caverns stretched endlessly before me as I strode through the halls of my domain. After eons of battling my way to the top, I had finally achieved my goal. Level 50 - the highest level of godhood. Down here, my power was absolute. The souls of the dead quaked at my passing. Demons and spirits bowed and scraped, eager to do my bidding. 

None dared challenge me. Except, it seemed, for the occasional fool.

A sharp rap on my ankle broke my brooding thoughts. I glanced down in annoyance. A small figure wielding a toy wooden sword stood behind me, hitting my heel with all his might. I sighed, halting my progress. This newcomer must have just arrived in the underworld, his soul fresh from the mortal realm. He couldn’t have been level 1 for more than a few hours.

I turned to face the upstart, folding my arms across my broad chest. My obsidian armor glinted dully, darkened pits where my eyes should be staring out from a skull wreathed in shadows. 

The child’s eyes went wide. His wooden sword drooped as his hands started to shake. He had not been expecting a level 50 god, especially not me, the most feared and ruthless of all the underworld deities.

“P-please don’t hurt me,” he squeaked. I considered him for a moment, then knelt down on one knee, bringing us closer to eye level. The boy twitched as if to flee, but my gaze kept him pinned in place.

“You are either very brave or very foolish to disturb me, young soul,” I rumbled. My voice was like gravel falling into a bottomless abyss. “What is your name?”

The boy gulped. “T-Tommy,” he stammered. 

I grunted. “And do you have any idea who I am, Tommy?” I asked. The boy shook his head nervously.

“I am the God of the Dead,” I proclaimed, sitting back on my haunches. “The Harvester of Souls. The Final Judge of mortal spirits.” Tommy's face, already pale from his recent demise, turned ashen. 

"I'm s-sorry for hitting you," he cried, tears welling up in his eyes. "I didn't mean to be bad. I just wanted to go on an adventure."

I waved a hand, dismissing his apology. "There are no gods in the mortal world, little spirit. But here, the rules are different. You would do well to be more cautious." I paused, considering. Though this child was foolish, his soul did not seem irredeemable. And I had not tasted an heroic soul in a long while.

"However," I continued, "your bravery has amused me. I will grant you a boon."

Tommy blinked in surprise. "A boon?" he asked uncertainly. 

I nodded. "You wish for an adventure? I shall give you a quest. Complete it, and I will raise you to level 10 and release you to explore the underworld." Tommy's eyes grew round with excitement and disbelief. 

"Really?" he cried. I nodded again.

"Here is your task: you must travel to the Shrieking Pits and retrieve a wailing stone from the clutches of a grieving widow. Return the stone to me, and your reward will be great." 

Tommy gripped his wooden sword tightly, his fear replaced by determination. "I won't fail!" he promised. I laughed, a grim, hollow sound that echoed through the caverns. 

"We shall see, young soul. We shall see."
