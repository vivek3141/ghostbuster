The Timer 

Emma glanced at the timer on her wrist, as she did every morning. 10 days, 13 hours and 27 minutes left. Her heart skipped a beat. After 30 years of waiting, she was finally going to meet her soulmate.

Emma went through her day in a daze. Work at the florist shop dragged on. All she could think about was the timer ticking down. What would he be like? Where will I meet him? She made floral arrangements mechanically, her mind occupied with thoughts of what was to come.

The next day, Emma was out at lunch when she noticed a handsome man smiling at her from across the restaurant. She smiled back shyly and glanced at her timer. Her eyes widenedâ€”it read just 1 hour and 13 minutes left. Emma's heart raced. Could this be him? She tried to remind herself of the odds of meeting her soulmate just hours before the timer ran out.  Impossible. But what if...

Emma walked back to the shop with a spring in her step. The timer was down to just 10 minutes now. And who should walk through the door at that exact moment but the man from the restaurant, holding a bouquet of flowers.

"Delivery for Emma," he said, smiling broadly.

Emma stared at him, then down at her timer as it buzzed. It read 00 hours, 00 minutes, 00 seconds. She looked up with tears of joy in her eyes.

"It's you." she whispered. 

"Soulmates, at last." he replied. He held out the flowers. "I'm Michael. I saw you at the restaurant and took a chance you might be the one. I wanted to find you before the timer hit zero."  

Emma threw her arms around Michael, overjoyed at being in the arms of the man fate had destined for her. After waiting so long, her soulmate was finally by her side, and the timers that had guided them their whole lives had led them to this perfect moment together at long last.
