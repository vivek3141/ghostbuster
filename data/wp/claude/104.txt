I woke up to the smell of eggs and toast as my husband, Captain Obvious, had already started making breakfast. 

"Good morning, Captain Obvious," I said as I walked into the kitchen.

"Good morning, dear," he replied. "I'm making eggs and toast for breakfast, which we eat in the morning."

I smiled and poured myself a cup of coffee. We sat down to eat and talk about our plans for the day.

"I think I'll mow the lawn today, since the grass has gotten quite long," Captain Obvious observed between bites of egg. 

"That's a good idea, the lawn does need mowing," I agreed.

After breakfast I went to take a shower while Captain Obvious washed the dishes. "I'm washing the dishes so we have clean plates and cups to use again," he noted from the kitchen.

"Wise thinking, dear!" I called back.

I then sat down to do some work for my job. As usual, Captain Obvious came in to state the obvious. "You're working right now, I see. I will leave you be so you can focus."

"Thank you, that would be helpful," I replied.

Around lunchtime, Captain Obvious called me to eat. "It's time for lunch, so I made sandwiches." 

After eating, Captain Obvious proceeded to mow the lawn as planned. I continued my work as I heard the lawnmower roar and Captain Obvious comment, "I'm now mowing the lawn with the lawnmower so the grass will be shorter."

By dinner time, we were both ready to relax from a productive day of pointing out the blatantly clear and undertaking mundane chores. As we sat down to dinner, Captain Obvious sighed and said, "It's been a rather long day, hasn't it? But a good one, filled with accomplishing necessary tasks and the stating of obvious facts, as is customary in our household."

I smiled at my ridiculous yet devoted husband. Another day in our marriage to Captain Obvious.
