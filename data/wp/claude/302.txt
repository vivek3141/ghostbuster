The mug taunted me from across the kitchen counter. There it sat, pristine white with "Susan" emblazoned on the side in obnoxious blue script, a gift from my coworkers for my 5th "anniversary" at the company. As if 5 years chained to a desk doing menial paperwork was something to celebrate. 

I had nowhere else to put the ugly thing so on the counter it remained, a constant reminder of the inanity of office life and obligatory social rituals. Its overly cheerful greeting irritated me every time I entered the kitchen. "Good morning, Susan!" it seemed to chirp. "Are you having a productive day?"

This morning, I finally snapped. The mug's message seemed louder and more mocking than usual. As I filled it with coffee, the glue holding the handle on gave way, sending the mug crashing to the floor. Shards of ceramic flew across the kitchen tiles as hot coffee splattered the cabinets. 

A smile crept across my face. No more inane greetings. No more obnoxious reminders of workplace obligations. As I grabbed paper towels to clean the mess, my eyes caught the pieces of the once pristine mug. The blue letters were fractured but still legible. "Su...an".  Those broken letters gave me an odd sense of satisfaction.  

Just then the doorbell rang, jolting me out of my moment of contentment. It was a delivery man with a package. "Congratulations on your 5th year with the company!" read the note inside. My heart sank as I tore away the paper to find another godforsaken mug, this one even larger and more ostentatious than the last, the letters "Susan" now spelled out in pink glitter. Some punishments, it seems, will follow you no matter what. I sighed and found a place for the horrid thing on a shelf, a new reminder of life's endless torments and the futile attempts to escape them.
