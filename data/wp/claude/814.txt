Four years ago, you watched your closest friend enter a portal. Since, you've waited every day for her to come out. She just stepped out, with a defeated, scared look on her face.  

I sat on the park bench, staring at the shimmering azure portal as I had done every day for the past four years. Waiting for Jenny to emerge. Hoping today would be the day.

The portal glowed, lighting up the clearing in the woods. My heart seized as a figure stumbled out and collapsed on the grass. “Jenny!” I screamed, rushing over to her. 

It was her. My best friend Jenny, who had walked through that portal four years ago on a dare. But the woman who emerged looked very little like the vibrant 22-year-old I remembered. Her hair was matted, her face pale and gaunt. She was trembling and kept looking around wildly, as if expecting some horror to emerge from the portal behind her.

“Jenny, it’s me, Mark,” I said softly, kneeling beside her. Her eyes focused on mine, filled with fear and disbelief. 

“Mark?” she whispered. “You...you waited?”  

“Of course I did,” I replied, overcome with emotion. I wanted to hug her but was afraid of frightening her. “What happened in there?”

She shook her head, tears flowing down her cheeks. “I don't...I can't...”

“It's okay,” I said soothingly. “You're safe now. I'm here.”

She threw her arms around me, sobbing into my shoulder. I held her tightly as her body shook, releasing four years of built up trauma. We stayed like that for a long time until her sobs subsided.  

When she lifted her head, there was a glimmer of the old Jenny in her eyes. “Thank you for waiting,” she said. 

“Always,” I replied. 

She took a deep, shaky breath. "I was trapped. In this strange world, filled with dangerous creatures and...and magic. I didn't know how to get back. I fought every day just to survive, hoping I could find another portal to escape through.”

My heart broke at what she had gone through. To be trapped and fighting for survival every single day. All alone. "How did you find your way back?”

A haunted look crossed her face. "It opened. The portal, it was like it was waiting for me. But things came out of it, chasing me. I barely made it through ahead of them. We have to seal it, Mark. We can't let those monsters into our world."

I studied the portal, this mysterious gateway that had returned my friend, but also unleashed unknown terrors. Jenny was right. We had to find a way to close it. I put my arms around her again, filled with determination.  

“Don't worry,” I told her. “Now that I have you back, I will never let anything hurt you again. We'll seal the portal. Together.”

She nodded, leaning her head against my shoulder once more. I knew then, in that moment, that no matter what it took - our lives from now on would be about keeping our world safe. And about making up for those four lost years that had disappeared into another world. I smiled, finally at peace now that my friend, my Jenny,  had come back home.
