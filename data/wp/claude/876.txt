The squealing brakes shattered the silence of the night. I slammed on my brakes, swerving to avoid the deer that darted into the road. My car spun out of control, headlights illuminating the guardrail rushing towards me. 

Panic rose in my chest as I realized I was moments away from a horrific crash. In desperation, I threw my hands up and shouted, "Jesus, take the wheel!"

I braced for impact, but it never came. Slowly, I opened my eyes. My car was still, nestled in some bushes on the side of the road. I was unharmed. But that's not what made my breath catch in my throat.

Jesus was not driving. In the driver's seat was a woman - if you could call her that. Her skin seemed to glow, and she looked at me with eyes as deep as the night sky. An angel. 

"Are you alright?" she asked. Her voice was melodic, soothing.

I stammered, unable to find words. She gave a small smile. 

"Do not be afraid. I will not harm you."

"Are you..." my voice was barely a whisper, "An angel?"

She nodded. "I am. When you called out for help, I came. Although 'Jesus' did not take your wheel, I was sent to assist you."

My mind was racing with questions. "Why did you help me? Why are you here?" 

"We are always watching over humanity. I intervened to save your life, as it is not yet your time. You still have work left to do." Her eyes flitted up, looking at something over my shoulder. "It seems I must take my leave. Remember, we are always watching. Help will come if you ask. Farewell for now."

With that, a bright light flashed and she was gone. I sat stunned, gripping the steering wheel in awe of what just transpired. An angel had saved me, and now I knew there were more chapters yet to be written in the story of my life.
