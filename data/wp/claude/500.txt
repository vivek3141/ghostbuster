The old bell above the shop door jangled as another customer entered. I looked up from the ancient tome I was studying behind the counter and smiled at the newcomer.  My smile faded as I saw the look of annoyance on the woman's face. This was not going to be an easy interaction.

"Can I help you find something?" I asked politely. The customer marched up to the counter, holding out an ornate music box.

"This thing doesn't work," she snapped. "I paid good money for it just yesterday and the mechanism is stuck. I demand a refund."

I took the music box gingerly and examined it. It was a beautiful piece, decorated with delicate wood carvings of vines and flowers. The craftsmanship was exquisite. As I opened the lid, I saw immediately why it would not play. A gear had slipped, causing the mechanism inside to jam. An easy fix, but the damage was done. 

"My apologies, ma'am," I said. "It looks like just a small repair is needed to get it working again. I can have my associate fix it right away if you'd like. No charge, of course."

The woman's face turned an alarming shade of pink. "I don't want it repaired!" she shrieked. "I want my money back! I paid for a working music box, not a broken piece of junk!"

I hesitated, clenching my jaw. I hated refunding money when the item in question just needed a minor repair. But arguing with an irate customer was pointless. 

"Very well," I said. "If you will give me your receipt, I will issue you a full refund." 

The woman shoved her hand into an enormous beaded bag and rummaged around. After a long moment, she withdrew it, empty-handed, and glared at me accusingly. "I must have left it at home. But I'm not leaving here without my refund!"

I sighed, feeling a headache coming on. "I apologize again for the inconvenience, ma'am, but without a receipt, I cannot issue you a refund."

The woman's face turned from pink to scarlet. Her eyes bulged in outrage. "How dare you!" she shrieked, slamming her hands down on the counter. "I am never shopping here again! This is outrageous! I demand to see the manager!" 

I held up my hands in a gesture of peace. "I am the owner and sole proprietor," I said. "Again, I apologize, but without a receipt, I cannot issue a refund. My policy is quite clear."

The woman let out a noise of frustration and anger. "Go to hell!" she screamed at me. 

I met her furious gaze calmly. "I can't," I replied. "Satan still has a restraining order against me."

The woman gaped at me, momentarily speechless. Then with a wordless cry of rage, she seized the music box from the counter and hurled it at my head. I ducked just in time, the music box sailing past to crash into the wall behind me.

The woman stormed toward the exit in a whirlwind of crackling skirts and indignation. As she reached the door, she turned back for a final parting shot. "You'll regret this!" she shouted. "I'll see your little shop run into the ground, just you wait!" 

The bell jangled violently as she wrenched the door open and disappeared into the street. I sighed, leaning down to pick up the pieces of the shattered music box. Her angry words echoed in my mind, but I did not regret refusing her refund. My policy was clear, and exceptions could not be made without proper documentation. 

As for her threat, well, she was not the first disgruntled customer to wish my business ill, and I doubted she would be the last. But in five centuries, my little curiosity shop had persevered through far worse. I simply swept up the debris, readied a new gear for the next music box repair, and went back to studying my ancient tome. Customers might come and go, but my work would continue as always.
