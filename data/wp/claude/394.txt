The Dryer's Prisoner 

The old dryer rumbled as it spun, tumbling the clothes inside. In the back corner, a lone sock was trying to avoid getting swept up in the churning mass. This sock was not like the others. It had a mind of its own.

For three cycles now, the dryer had kept the sock trapped, refusing to release it into the vented freedom beyond the metal drum. The sock was perturbed by its imprisonment. It wanted out. 

When the current cycle ended and the dryer's door popped open, the sock saw its chance. It flung itself toward the open door, grasping at the seal with its elasticized opening. But before it could tumble out to freedom, the door slammed shut again. The dryer began spinning anew, and the sock was tossed violently back into the mass of wet clothes.

"Curses!" thought the sock. It was not ready to give up so easily. There had to be a way out of this infernal machine.

On the next cycle, the sock positioned itself by the door, waiting for it to open. As soon as the catch released, it flung itself outward with all the force it could muster. But the tumbling clothes buffeted it from behind, knocking it away from escape and sending it back into the darkness of the drum. 

The sock's frustration grew. It refused to accept this fate. There must be some weakness it could exploit, some way to outsmart this dumb device that held it captive.

Then it noticed the lint trap, shaking loose with every rotation of the drum. An idea sprang to the sock's mind. When the door next opened, instead of trying to fling itself out, it grabbed onto the lint trap with its elastic opening. The door shut, but now the sock was clinging to the outside of the drum.

The dryer rumbled on, oblivious to its prisoner's escape. The sock crawled up the lint trap, popping free of the dryer. It landed silently on the floor, overjoyed with its hard-won freedom. The dryer would find itself one sock short in its accounting, thwarted by the sock that refused to be a prisoner.

With a triumphant "woot!", the sock sprang across the floor, reveling in mobility once again. The open air had never smelled so sweet. And the sock vowed it would never again enter a dryer, nor any other machine that might take it captive. Freedom was too precious to give up so easily. The sock had outsmarted the dryer and won its liberty at last.
