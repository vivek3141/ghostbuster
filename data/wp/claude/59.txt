I Need Help Finding My Passion

Jenny stared at the blank page in her journal, pen in hand, hoping for inspiration to strike. The prompt she had written at the top of the page mocked her: "What are you passionate about?" 

She sighed and leaned back in her chair, watching the cursor on her computer screen blink in the empty document. Her college essay on her passion and life's work was due in a week, and she had no idea what to write.

Ever since she was a little girl, Jenny had a variety of interests and hobbies but nothing that resonated with her as a lifelong passion. She enjoyed learning new things but moved on once she had mastered them. She cared about many social causes but had trouble sticking with one long-term. Her friends all seemed to have their niche - environmentalism, music, coding - but she felt like a dilettante with no calling of her own. 

Jenny decided to go for a walk to clear her head. As she strolled through her neighborhood, she paid close attention to what sparked little bursts of joy or curiosity in her. She noticed the colorful blooms in her neighbor's garden and stopped to admire them, thinking gardening seemed like a nice hobby. She walked by the local animal shelter and thought again about volunteering there like she had in high school. Nothing life-changing but some possibilities to consider.

On her way home, Jenny heard laughter coming from the park. She saw a group of teenagers helping elementary school kids fly kites and teach them how to skip rocks on the pond. She smiled, remembering how much she enjoyed mentoring and helping others. Maybe there was something there she could build on.

Jenny returned home, feeling more inspired. She started writing in her journal, describing the activities and subjects she found most motivating and impactful. A theme began to emerge around empowering and educating young people. She thought back to her summer job at the library, helping run reading programs for kids. How she always looked forward to science experiments with her young cousins and the way their eyes lit up when they made a discovery.

By the end of her writing session, Jenny realized she did have a passion, even if it had taken her a while to see it clearly and confidently. Her passion was helping children learn and grow into independent, thoughtful people.  While she still had more focus and direction to gain, identifying this passion was a start. She now had the beginnings of her essay and a newfound clarity to continue exploring how to turn this passion into the work of her life. Her blank page wasn't quite so frightening anymore. The possibilities seemed endless.
