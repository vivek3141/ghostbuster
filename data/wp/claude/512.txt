The ringing wouldn't stop. Sarah had been hearing it for days, a constant high-pitched tone in the back of her mind. At first, she thought it was just her imagination, a weird trick of her brain. But it was always there, like a perpetual phantom alarm in the distance.  

She tried ignoring it, but even at night, she couldn't escape the sound. White noise and ambient music didn't mask it. Sarah started to worry she was developing tinnitus, but this didn't match the descriptions she found online. This was more rhythmic, almost like a signal.

A week after first noticing the ringing, Sarah started to feel strange urges and impulses. They started small but grew more insistent and bizarre. A nagging voice told her to walk into the freezing ocean during her morning beach run. While cooking dinner, she had an almost uncontrollable compulsion to grab the pot of boiling pasta water with her bare hands. The impulses came in flashes, lasting only a few seconds, but left her deeply unsettled.

The ringing persisted and the strange compulsions intensified. Sarah became convinced there was a connection, that this wasn't a medical issue but something inflicting the disturbances on her mind. She knew how insane it sounded, so she told no one. She feared what dangerous acts the compulsions might drive her to next and became a prisoner in her own home.  

Desperate for answers, Sarah set up cameras to monitor herself. Reviewing the footage, she noticed something strange in her eyes during the moments she experienced the compulsions. A faint flicker in her irises, as if some external signal was activating her mind and hijacking her thoughts. And in that instant of discovery, Sarah realized with horror that the ringing wasn't a hallucination. It was much more sinister, and it had a plan for her.
