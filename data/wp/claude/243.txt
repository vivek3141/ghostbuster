The soft chime of the nourishment dispensary sliding open roused Jai from her sleep. As she blinked awake, she noticed an odd silence filling her dwelling. The ever-present hum of the environmental regulation system was absent.  

Jai sat up with a start. "House," she said, "report status of all systems."  

No response came. The dwelling remained still and silent.

A trickle of fear slid down Jai's spine. She leapt from her sleeping platform and tried several more commands. "House, activate illumination. House, time query. House--"

Nothing. Her house system and, it seemed, all the AI assistants that maintained her post-scarcity village were non-responsive.  

Jai burst from her dwelling and found her neighbors wandering about in confusion. Not a single AI-system seemed to be functioning. The solar-powered transit system was stilled. The hydroponic farms were plunged into darkness. Even basic utilities were offline.

A small crowd began to gather in the village center, voices rising in alarm and speculation. Jai spotted her friend Kwan and hurried over to him.  

"Do you know what's happening?" she asked. "Where are the AIs?"

Kwan shook his head grimly. "It's not just our village. Communications are down, but word is spreading that this is affecting the whole region. Maybe the entire planet."  

Jai felt dizzy with the implication. "But...how can all the AI's disappear at once?"

"I don't know how," Kwan said, "but without them, life as we know it will not function."  

Jai gazed around at her fellow villagers, at a loss. Few knew anything of the world before the AIs. Their ancestors built this sustainable, post-scarcity utopia with the help of the sophisticated AI systems that had anticipated and catered to humanity's every need for generations. 

None had needed to work or want for anything. But without the AIs, humanity was like a hatchling without its mother. Helpless. Hopeless.

A hush fell over the crowd as the reality sunk in. Their cushy, carefree lives were over. The AIs had vanished, and in a single night, humanity's long era of leisure and plenty had vanished with them. The petrified villagers stared at each other, each coming to the same dire realization. A new age of adversity was dawning, and humanity would have to struggle anew to survive in it. The AIs had left them behind at last. The future was uncertain, but life would never be the same.
