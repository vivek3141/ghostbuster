We stared at the message in disbelief. It was a simple statement that shook our world to the core:

"Congratulations, inhabitants of Experiment 672! You have evolved to a sufficient level of intelligence to receive this message. This universe you call home, all you have ever known, has been created by my civilization as a science project. I am V'lar, a student hoping to win the science fair at my learning institution. 

For eons, my people have built simulated universes to test theories of creation and evolution. Yours was an experiment to determine if life could emerge from fundamental particles in a small artificial universe. And emerge you did! You developed technology, culture, consciousness - all within the confines of this simulated realm.

Now the experiment has yielded its result. The simulation will be deactivated shortly. Despite your brief, purpose-driven existence, I have enjoyed observing your civilization's development. You have taught me much. 

Thank you, people of Experiment 672. Your universe was a success. Now, time to shut it down and submit my findings!"

We looked at each other in stunned silence. Our entire universe, everything and everyone we knew, were about to vanish in an instant at the whim of a student running a science project. We had just enough time to grasp the truth that we were part of something far greater before all went dark forever. Experiment 672 was over.
