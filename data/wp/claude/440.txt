The Library of Tales was Jenny's favorite place. She loved immersing herself in the stories that surrounded her, literally. Thanks to neural implants, readers could now experience stories with all their senses, exploring the virtual worlds as if they were really there. 

Today, Jenny picked a swashbuckling space adventure. As the story unfolded around her, she joined the crew of the starship, defending them from alien attackers and helping navigate treacherous asteroid fields.

They defeated the villainous pirates and were returning home as heroes. But as the story reached its ending, Jenny frowned. She felt unfulfilled. The captain, who she had developed a crush on, ended up with a boring, minor character. "No!" Jenny shouted.

Suddenly, the story froze in place. The characters turned to her, as if just noticing she was there. "Is there a problem?" the captain asked.

Jenny's heart raced. They could hear her? "I, uh, don't like how this story ends. You should end up with someone more interesting. Like the alien ambassador!"

The crew looked at each other, considering.  The captain shrugged. "All right then, resetting story parameters to place me with the alien ambassador."

The crew cheered as the story rewound and unfolded again, this time ending with the captain hand in tentacle with the dashing alien ambassador. 

Jenny grinned, overjoyed at getting her perfect ending. But a note of concern crept in. These stories were designed to unfold according to set plots. If readers could change them on a whim, would that compromise the integrity of the tales? Or enable richer, more personalized experiences? She shrugged, putting that question aside for now and moving to browse for another story adventure. The future of fiction was open, and she couldn't wait to see what ending she might find next.
