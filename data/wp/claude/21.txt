Simon stumbled through the dense jungle, heart pounding. The sounds of the beast were getting closer. An unearthly hiss echoed between the ancient trees, followed by a roar that shook the very air. 

He had been foolish to venture into the Forest of Scrolith alone. His fellow villagers had warned him, but Simon was determined to prove himself as a hunter. He thought he could take down one of the fabled white tigers that roamed these woods. But now he realized, too late, that he was the prey.

Another roar thundered behind Simon as a massive paw, claws as long as daggers, swiped at his back. Pain seared across his shoulders as his tunic was shredded. He cried out and ran faster, ignoring the blood flowing down his back.

Up ahead, Simon spotted a massive tree whose roots formed an arch over a small hollow. If he could make it there, he might be safe. The tiger would not be able to reach into that space with its claws. He threw himself forward just as the beast pounced again, its hot breath on the back of his neck. Rolling into the hollow, Simon crouched down as far as he could go, hoping it would be enough.

An enormous white muzzle, stained red with Simon's blood, poked under the roots. The tiger snorted in frustration, realizing its prey had escaped - for now. One glowing yellow eye peered in at Simon, filled with rage and hunger. It let out an ear-splitting roar, a promise of vengeance and a grisly death. 

But the hollow was too small for the tiger to reach Simon. It prowled around the tree, searching for a way in, but eventually gave up. The sounds of its footsteps faded into the distance. 

Simon remained in the hollow until sunlight filtered through the dense canopy above. His back burned, but he had survived. He would return home battered and bloodied, with no trophy, but with a newfound respect for the thousand teeth of Scrolith and the ancient beasts that guarded this forest. He had escaped the tiger's claws and lived to tell the tale - and warn other foolish souls not to venture into the woods alone.
