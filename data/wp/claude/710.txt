You threw your head back and laughed at the joke your friend Mark just told. As you glanced around the room at your closest friends gathered to celebrate your birthday, a strange feeling crept into your mind. Lately, little things they said or did seemed a bit off. Almost as if they knew more about you and your routine than normal friends should. 

You shook the thought from your head as you blew out the candles on your cake. Just paranoia. But later that evening, as you were leaving the bar with Michael and Lizzie, you realized they were walking on either side of you in a protective formation. When you arrived home, John and Stephen were there waiting in the living room, behaving as if it was perfectly normal for them to be there at midnight without any heads up.

A cold chill ran down your spine. Your friends had always been there for you, but their behavior tonight seemed coordinated, almost as if they were...guarding you. The realization hit you like a freight train—your friends weren't just friends. They were undercover agents tasked with protecting you.

Your mind raced through the implications when you heard a window smash downstairs. You froze in place, but your friends sprang into action, grabbing you and pushing you behind them as figures began climbing through the broken window. Except these weren't ordinary burglars—they were carrying rifles with silencers. 

One of the men snarled, "Where is the target?" You gasped and your friends formed a tighter circle around you. You peered out from behind them to see five armed gunmen scanning the room. When one of their gazes fell upon you, he lifted his weapon. 

"There! Get the target!" he shouted. Your friends dove in front of you as shots rang out. You screamed as they fired back while pushing you out of the line of fire. Amid the chaos, you felt a hand grab your arm and yank you backwards. "Come with me, we have to get you out of here!" Michael yelled as he pulled you towards the back exit. 

Your head swimming, you ran with him to his car. Your loyal friends, no, your protectors, had saved you yet again. As you sped off into the night, leaving the gunfight behind, you knew you owed them more than just the truth. You owed them your life.
