Jake typed the coordinates into the Slingshot Mk7 and waited as it calibrated for the latest timeline hop. When the indicator changed from red to green, he hit the launch button. 

There was a flash and the world around Jake changed. Gone were the brushed metal walls of the time machine chamber, replaced by opulent wood panels and oil lamps. Jake took a deep breath, the musty scent of the 18th century filling his nostrils.

A quick check of his holographic disguise in the mirror showed a proper 1700s nobleman staring back at him. His Two Timers uniform was gone, replaced by ruffled cuffs, a tricorne hat and beauty mark. 

Jake strode out of the abandoned barn that served as his launch point, heading into the manor house where Lady Penelope was hosting a masquerade ball. His watch still worked, showing he had 3 hours until his Slingshot automatically retrieved him. More than enough time for a tryst with the delightful Lady P.

As Jake entered the ballroom, powdered wigs and masks swirled around him.  He caught sight of Lady P in a scarlet gown, gazing at him longingly from behind her fan. As Jake approached, she whispered “To the old tower, in 10 minutes.”

Jake grinned, his heartbeat quickening. This was the thrill of time travel romance - secret encounters in different eras, no strings attached, no consequences.  Two Timers Incorporated promised discreet affairs with any time period their clients desired. 

After the required 10 minutes of social niceties, Jake slipped out of the ballroom and climbed the spiral stairs of the tower. At the top, Lady P was waiting, wig askew and gown already unlaced.

“My darling,” she purred, drawing him into an embrace. Jake was intoxicated by her scent and the danger of their encounter.

Just then, a deafening roar shook the tower. The skies outside lit up, blinding in their brightness. 

“What witchcraft is this!” cried Lady P, clutching at Jake in terror. He peered out the narrow window to see a huge metal craft hovering over the manor, searchlights scouring the ground.

Jake’s blood ran cold. It couldn’t be. But there was no mistaking the TTI logo on the side of the craft. Something had gone wrong with their timeline andnowTwo Timers Incorporated had come looking for him.

His watch beeped urgently, the 3 hours up. But with TTI’s enforcers already here, there would be no slipping away unnoticed tonight. Jake took Lady P’s trembling hand, his perfect system crashed down around him. The cheater’s paradise had found its end.
