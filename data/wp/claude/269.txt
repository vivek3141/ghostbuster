The Amazing Amanda sighed as she floated high above the city, impervious to the cold wind. Her amazing superpowers allowed her to fly, super strength, and invulnerability. She could do things no normal human ever could.

Yet here she was, bored out of her mind. 

When Amanda first discovered her powers a few months ago, she was ecstatic. She would finally be able to help people with her amazing gifts. She designed a flashy costume and came up with her superhero name, The Amazing Amanda.

But her first few attempts at heroics were utterly pointless. She tried stopping a high-speed chase, but the police had already deployed spike strips to end it. She helped evacuate a burning building, only to find the fire department had already cleared the entire building. Each time she tried to help, the relevant authorities already had the situation under control with their training, skills, and technology.

Her powers were useless compared to modern tools and techniques. Everything she could do, technology and law enforcement could do better and faster. 

As Amanda gazed down at the city, she wondered if there was any point to her powers at all. She couldnâ€™t find a way to help that didn't just get in the way. All she seemed good for was floating above the city, an invulnerable bystander. Her dream of becoming a real superhero, of using her gifts to save the day, seemed utterly unreachable. With a sad sigh, Amanda flew up into the clouds, disappearing from view.
