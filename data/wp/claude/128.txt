The Price of Paradise 

The old wooden sign hung crookedly from a post that had seen better days. The faded letters were still legible: “Paradise awaits, but not for free. The twisted and most evil thoughts you've had in life must be enacted upon you before you can enter.”

Jenna stared at the sign, a chill running down her spine. Her journey to Paradise had been long and difficult, full of obstacles and trials to test her spirit and determination. She had conquered them all, believing she had finally proven herself worthy of the eternal bliss that awaited in Paradise. 

But this final challenge seemed different. Darker. More sinister.

Her eyes scanned the valley before her. Paradise was visible in the distance, all golden light and joy, a place of beauty just out of reach. The only path there led through a rocky, treacherous gorge below the sign.

As Jenna started down the path, shadows seemed to writhe and stir around her. The air felt heavy. Oppresive. She walked slowly, nervously eyeing the jagged rocks and twisting passages around each turn.

Before long, she heard a hiss behind her. She spun around but nothing was there. Her heart pounding, she quickened her pace. Then came whispers in her ear, faint but unmistakable. Her own voice, speaking her darkest thoughts. The twisted imaginings she had never given life but had flickered briefly in the deepest recesses of her mind.

A scream caught in her throat as she broke into a run. The path narrowed until she could hardly fit, jagged rocks tearing at her clothes and skin. But the crevices echoed with laughter now. Her laughter. 

 The path opened into a clearing. Breathless, Jenna stopped short, looking around wildly. The clearing was empty. But in front of her stood a narrow bridge of rope and wooden slats spanning a chasm. Far below, nightmarish creatures prowled and howled.

Her eyes snapped up to see a figure approaching from the other side of the bridge. A little girl, no more than six or seven, with golden curls and a sweet smile. Jenna sighed in relief. But as the girl set foot on the bridge, her smile melted into a sinister grin. She stared at Jenna with contempt and said in a distorted grown-up voice, "You stood by and did nothing while I suffered. You deserve this.” 

Jenna gasped. How did this creature know her darkest secret? Decades ago, Jenna had glimpsed a little girl being abused but had been too scared to get help. Her cowardice and indifference had haunted her all her life.

The girl strode confidently across the swaying bridge. With a shriek, she stampeded into Jenna, shoving her onto the bridge. Jenna clung to the ropes, struggling for balance over the yawning abyss. She glanced up to see the girl had disappeared—if she had ever truly been there at all.

Laughter and applause erupted from the shadows. The creatures below the bridge howled in glee at her terror. Jenna realizing with dawning horror that there would be no end to the nightmares conjured from the depths of her own mind. Her evil thoughts given life to torment her for eternity. 

With a sob, Jenna collapsed to her knees on the bridge. The price of Paradise was more than she could bear. There would be no bliss awaiting her, only anguish of her own creation. She hung her head as the creatures’ howls faded into the distance and darkness claimed everything around her. Paradise was forever out of her reach. The price was too high.
