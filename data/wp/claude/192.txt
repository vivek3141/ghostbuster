The morning sun filtered through the grimy windows of the rundown apartment. Mark blinked his eyes open, groaning at the pounding in his head. His body ached for release, for a hit of the only thing that could make him whole again. 

He fumbled on the nightstand for his works. The familiar ritual of cooking up a shot of heroin in a spoon and filling the syringe calmed his nerves. His hands steadied as the amber liquid filled the chamber. A length of rubber hose acted as a tourniquet around his bicep, the veins below bulging obscenely.  

With the needle in, Mark leaned back and closed his eyes. An enveloping warmth spread out from the injection site, seeping into his muscles, dulling the pains of existence. His mind quieted and for a blissful few hours, he simply floated.

When he came to, the high had worn off and the cravings started anew. His stomach rumbled but he had no money for food. His dealer, Vlad, wasn't expecting a delivery till nightfall. Mark paced his apartment, unable to keep still as his body screamed for another hit.

Night couldn't come fast enough. When the clock finally read 9 pm, Mark burst out of his apartment and headed to the alley two blocks over. As expected, Vlad's hulking frame materialized out of the darkness. Mark hastily counted out crumpled bills into the dealer's outstretched hand. 

"Not enough for a full bag," Vlad grunted. "This will have to do for now. Don't be late again." 

Mark clutched at the small bag of white powder like a lifeline. He hurried into a pub, bought a beer to avoid suspicion, and locked himself in the grimy bathroom stall. His hands shook as he cooked up a shot twice as big as his morning fix. The heroin hit his system like a sledgehammer and with an explosive rush, Mark slid into a blissful stupor.

The night passed in a haze of nods and half-formed thoughts. At some point he stumbled back to his apartment and passed out on the bed, not waking until the sun stabbed at his eyes again the next morning. His body was heavy, filled with lead, but his mind was clear for the first time in 12 hours.

And so the cycle continued, this daily chase for oblivion the only life Mark knew. He told himself this was the day he would quit for good. But the cravings came, like clockwork, refusing to be denied. His resolve crumbled like it always did. 

Pick your poison, Mark thought grimly as he filled another syringe with shaky hands. For him there was no choice, no way out of this labyrinth of need. Heroin was his poison and his sustenance, his tormentor and his only source of peace. He plunged the needle into his scarred vein and gave in once more to the only thing that made him feel whole.
