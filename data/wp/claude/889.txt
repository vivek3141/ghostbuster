The familiar old oak tree loomed over the hill, its branches swaying gently in the breeze. As I walked up the winding path, a sense of deep calm washed over me. I had been to this place so many times before in my dreams. 

At the top of the hill stood the little white cottage, smoke curling from its chimney. Before I could knock on the weathered wooden door it creaked open. There she was, the old woman who so often appeared in my dreams. Her wizened face broke into a toothless smile. "Welcome back, my dear! Come in, I've put the kettle on."

I followed her into the cozy kitchen, the aroma of cinnamon and freshly baked bread filling the air. "Sit down and warm yourself by the fire," she said. As she busied herself preparing a tray with teapot and cups, I gazed out the window at the familiar rolling green hills. Why was this place so vivid and unchanging each time I found myself here, asleep in my own bed miles away?

The old woman placed the tray on the table with a gentle clatter, startling me out of my reverie. She peered at me through rheumy eyes. "You seem troubled today. What's the matter?" I opened my mouth to respond but couldn't find the words. How could I begin to describe the strange familiarity of this world that existed only in my dreams? She seemed to understand my unspoken question. "This is a special place, my child. A place of comfort and healing. That is why you return here each night."

I looked up with surprise. "You know this is a dream?" She smiled her toothless smile once more. "Of course. I'm always here when you need me." A realization began to dawn in my mind, bringing with it a feeling of deep disquiet. "Who are you?" I asked haltingly. "Where am I?"

The old woman sighed, a look of sadness passing over her lined face. "You already know the answer. You just haven't wanted to face it." She reached over and grasped my hand, her papery skin as familiar as the touch of my own grandmother's. 

I awoke with a start in my hospital bed, my heart pounding. It couldn't be. I glanced over at the still figure in the other bed, the frail old woman I had shared my room with for weeks. The same woman I had unknowingly been visiting each night in my dreams. I walked over slowly and looked down into her pale, unmoving face. She appeared in that moment like a faded photograph of the vivacious figure who had just a moment ago served me tea and counsel. My mysterious dream companion and this comatose stranger were one and the same. I took her gnarled hand in mine, and wept with the bittersweet knowledge of dreams unfulfilled and a strange new connection I could now never lose. My vigil over this unknown woman who had become my unlikely guide and friend had only just begun.
