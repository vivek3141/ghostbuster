I have granted wishes for centuries, bound to an old lamp that has passed through many hands. Most wishes are small - riches, love, vengeance. But some stand out.

In 1547, a poor farmer rubbed the lamp. His first wish was for food to feed his family. His second was for better crops so he'd never want again. His third wish was that his village would always have enough. I granted prosperity and abundance for all.  

In 1920, a sick child found the lamp. Her wish was for all children to be healthy and happy. I eradicated disease and suffering for children around the world. Her selfless wish changed history.

Last year, a weary refugee rubbed the lamp. Her wish was for peace in her homeland. I brought stability, safety and tranquility. Not through force or control, but through compassion and understanding. By softening hearts and opening minds. 

Three simple wishes. Food, health, peace. Yet they shaped the world for the better. My power is limited to the imaginations of those who possess the lamp. For good or ill. I have seen humanity's potential for both. But in the end, most wish for basic kindness and dignity for all. And for that, I gladly grant. My name is Hope. I exist to serve.
