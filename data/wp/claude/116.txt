I glanced at the clock, 11:58 pm. Two more minutes until my shift started. I gulped down the last of my stale coffee and made my way to the secure access elevator. 

The elevator descended into the depths of Area 51. The doors opened to a dimly lit hallway. I swiped my key card and entered the cold, sterile lab. My colleagues were already at their stations, focused on the alien craft we had been studying for months.

As lead engineer, I approached the craft immediately. The strange symbols along its metallic surface still confounded our experts. We had not yet found a way to open the craft, despite our best efforts. I placed my hand on the exterior, feeling a faint vibration. Was it...humming?

At that moment, alarms blared. An emergency lockdown was triggered. My team scrambled, securing the area. 

"Report!" I shouted. No one had an answer. 

A loud hiss filled the room as a door opened in the craft's side. We aimed our weapons, a tense silence fell upon us.

A ramp descended. Our weapons shook in our grips. We stood, stunned, as two creatures appeared in the doorway.

They were the size of children, with elongated heads and large, black eyes. Their pale blue skin glowed under the harsh lights.

One creature stepped forward, raising its hands in a peaceful gesture. It spoke, its voice resonant in our minds: "Greetings. We mean you no harm. We have come from a distant world. Our purpose is exploration and discovery. We seek peaceful contact and cultural exchange. Do you accept our invitation?"

My heart raced. This was first contact. The course of humanity's future was now before us. History would remember this day. I stepped towards the creatures, my hands raised in greeting. "Welcome to Earth. We accept your invitation."
