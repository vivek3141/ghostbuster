The old lighthouse stood on the cliff, a silent sentinel overlooking the churning sea below.  Emma gazed out at the horizon, watching the crashing waves and listening to the cries of seagulls gliding on the wind. She took a deep breath of salty air and closed her eyes, feeling the warm sun on her face.

It had been 15 years since she last visited this lighthouse. She was just a child then, on a road trip with her parents. Her father was enthralled with lighthouses and made sure to stop at every one they passed. She remembered his excitement exploring the tower, reading every information placard, and talking with the park ranger. Her mother would pour over the gift shop, picking out little trinkets and toys to take home. It was a happy memory, frozen in time. 

So much had changed since that summer. Her father had passed away a few years later, and her mother slipped into a deep depression. Emma did her best to care for her mother, putting her own life on hold. The light that had once filled their home dimmed and faded. By the time her mother found the will to live again, Emma was firmly in the clutches of adulthood with little chance of escape.

She opened her eyes and gazed up at the red brick tower. It looked as it did in her memory, stoic in the face of time's passage. She wondered if the light inside still worked, guiding ships to safety even in the darkest of nights. 

Emma walked over to the door at the base of the tower and was surprised to find it unlocked. A wooden staircase twisted up into the shadows. She grabbed onto the railing and began her ascent, stepping carefully on the creaking steps. Spiderwebs caught in the corners and a musty smell filled the air.

At the top, she emerged into a narrow walkway encircling the giant light. The enormous glass lens was dark, no longer emitting its glow. She ran a hand gently along its surface, leaving a trail where she wiped away thick dust. 

In the distance, something caught her eye. A tiny light flickered at sea, a small beacon of hope. As she watched, it grew closer, and she realized it was an old sailing ship, making its way to shore as night fell. The ship navigated the rocky coastline, safely finding passage to the harbor.

Emma smiled, a warmth filling her chest. The lighthouse may no longer serve its purpose, but its memory lived on, a guidepost for the lost and weary. She knew then that the light inside her had never truly gone out. It was simply waiting for the chance to shine again.

She took one last look at the sea, breathed in the salty air, and made her way back down the twisting stairs. As Emma emerged again into the sunlight, she felt as though a weight had lifted. The joy of old memories returned, as fresh as the day they were made. Her father's love of adventure, her mother's kind heart - they were still there, gifts to carry with her always, helping to show the way.
