The old mill had seen better days. Once the largest producer of textiles in the county, it had fallen into disrepair and mismanagement. The owner, Mr. Pemberton, was at his wit's end trying to turn things around. As a last resort, he placed an ad seeking an office manager to come in and overhaul operations.  

To his surprise, he received a response from a young woman named Miss Price. While unconventional, Pemberton was in no place to be choosy. He hired Miss Price, hoping her outsider's perspective might be just the thing the mill needed.

Miss Price arrived early her first day, eager to get to work. The staff she met seemed pleasant enough, if a bit peculiar.  Mr. Fletcher, the foreman, had an unnerving habit of finishing other people's sentences. The head of the textile floor, Mr. Rainey, shook her hand enthusiastically for much too long while gazing intensely into her eyes. And Mr. Bartlett, in charge of the looms, never seemed to speak above a hoarse whisper. Still, Miss Price was determined to keep an open mind.

At the end of her first week, she sat down to compile her notes. Production was down, unsurprisingly, but waste and inefficiency seemed to pervade everything. Materials and tools went missing or were misused. Important documents had a habit of disappearing. Tensions ran high, with frequent arguments erupting between departments. 

A change in leadership was sorely needed, Miss Price concluded. She delivered her assessment to Mr. Pemberton, who gave her full authority to make whatever staffing changes she deemed necessary. However, when she began implementing reforms, she was met with suspicion and obstinacy at every turn.

“The old ways have served us well enough,” Mr. Rainey argued, his gaze once again unsettlingly intent. Mr. Fletcher nodded in enthusiastic agreement, declaring,  “New ideas will only disrupt our work.”

Mr. Bartlett said in a rough whisper, “It's not wise to change things that have worked for years."

Miss Price stood firm. "I was hired by Mr. Pemberton to improve efficiency and production. This mill must adapt or it will not survive.”

Begrudgingly, the strange staff accepted her changes, though they continued to watch her with wary eyes. Within a month, Miss Price had reorganized the workers, updated procedures, and implemented new safety standards. To her relief, output began to increase and waste declined.

One evening, Miss Price stayed late to double-check some records. Rounding a corner with a lit candle, she startled Mr. Fletcher and Mr. Rainey in the middle of a whispered conversation. They turned to face her with expressions of undisguised annoyance and irritation, dropping their friendly manners entirely. Mr. Rainey snarled, “This place was perfectly fine until you came along.”

Miss Price stood speechless, her candle trembling. Their faces seemed to shift in the flickering light, features momentarily rearranging into something sinister and malevolent. She blinked, and they were back to normal. 

Mr. Fletcher said smoothly, “Our apologies. We were just leaving.” They brushed past her without another word. Miss Price found herself trembling for reasons she couldn't explain. She resolved to be wary of the staff that were still so strange and inscrutable.
