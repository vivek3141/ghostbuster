The phone rings. You look at the caller ID and recognize the number of your childhood home. You pick up the phone and recognize the voice. It was yours when you were a kid.

You stare at the phone in your hand, stunned into silence. How is this possible? You know that number by heart, having grown up calling it every day. But your parents sold that house five years ago when they downsized into a condo.

"Hello?" The familiar yet unfamiliar voice comes through the line again. It's undeniably your voice, but from decades past, back when you were no more than eight or nine years old. 

You shake your head, sure this must be some kind of prank. "Who is this?" you ask cautiously.

The voice on the other end sounds confused. "It's me. Who did you think it was?"

Your mind reels. This can't actually be my childhood self, you think. That's impossible. But here you stand with the phone in hand, hearing a ghost from the past with your own ears. 

"Where are you calling from?" you press, trying to make sense of the nonsensical. 

"Our house, silly!" The giggle in the response delivers another shock of recognition. That's your laugh. Your family's nickname for you as a child, 'Silly',  echoes in your mind.

You sit down heavily on your couch, grasping at straws for a logical explanation. "What year do you think it is?"

"It's 1987, duh!" Young you replies with a hint of annoyance at the strange line of questioning. 

Over thirty years in the past. You shake your head in disbelief, but a strange thought is forming. What if, somehow, this call has slipped through a crack in time? What if you're really speaking to yourself as a child, all these years later?

Your mind spins at the implications. Young you continues chatting away about school and your favorite TV shows, but you barely hear the words. You're too focused on what this could mean, and what you could possibly say. Should you reveal who you are, speaking from decades in the future? Or would that only create chaos in both the past and present timelines?  

You struggle between your burning curiosity and the fear of metaphysical consequences beyond your understanding. But this may be a once in a lifetime opportunity, you realize. A chance to connect with who you used to be, and offer guidance to the child who is still figuring out their path in life.   

Taking a deep breath, you make a decision. "I have something to tell you, though you may not believe it," you say, interrupting young you mid-sentence. "I'm actually you, from the future. I'm calling from the year 2020."

Silence. Then, a burst of delighted laughter. "Wow, that's so cool! I didn't know I had a time phone. This is awesome!"

Your younger self accepts the impossible with the unbridled imagination of a child. To them, anything seems within the realm  of possibility, even a future version of themself calling out of the blue. 

Smiling, some of the tension leaves your body. You proceed to tell yourself a few tales of what life will bring, focusing on the joyful moments while glossing over the painful parts. You encourage following dreams and staying determined in face of obstacles. Most of all, you tell yourself to appreciate each moment and each person in their life. 

Before you know it, nearly an hour has passed in conversation with yourself across the expanse of time. But young you has to go to bed, though they beg to talk again. "Will you call back?" they ask hopefully. 

"I'll try," you promise, unsure if this experience can ever be replicated. "But no matter what happens, just remember - be good to others, follow your dreams, and enjoy the journey."

"I will!" comes the reply. "Bye future me! Thanks for calling. This has been the coolest day ever!"

You say goodbye, more emotional than you expect. As the call ends, you sit in silence once more. The impossible phone call has provided a chance for closure and connection you never anticipated was possible. Though you may never understand how or why it happened, you will remain forever grateful for the gift of speaking with your childhood self, if only for a short time. What a wonder, this thing we call life, full of mysteries beyond comprehension.
