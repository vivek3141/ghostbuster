Jenny sat alone during lunch, as usual. She picked at her food, not feeling very hungry.  She wished she had someone to talk to. At 16, she had never really had a close friend. Her autism made it difficult for her to connect with others and read social cues. 

She looked over at a group of girls laughing together a few tables over. They always seemed to be having so much fun. Jenny imagined what it would be like to join them, to share inside jokes and weekend plans. But she knew from experience that when she tried to join in with other girls her age, the conversation would fall flat, the interactions feeling awkward. It was easier to just avoid it altogether.

In her next class, English, Jenny's teacher announced they would be doing a group project. Jenny's heart sank. Group work always highlighted how different she was from the other students. She struggled to contribute and her groupmates usually ignored her input.

The teacher started assigning groups. "Jenny, you'll be with Emily, Beth, and Sasha," she announced. Jenny looked over at the three girls, who were popular and outgoing. They were sure to not want someone like her holding them back.

Emily caught Jenny's eye and smiled. "I'm glad you're in our group, Jenny! I loved your essay on Bradbury. You write so well."

Jenny was stunned. "Really?" she asked. Emily nodded. 

"Totally! I think this story is right up your alley. You should help figure out how we want to shape it."

Jenny felt a rush of relief and gratitude. For the first time, she felt like she had something to offer in a group project. She smiled back at Emily.

Over the next few work sessions together, Jenny found herself coming out of her shell. The three girls were patient, actively including Jenny and asking for her opinions. They genuinely seemed to appreciate her contributions. By the end of the week, what had started as a dreaded group project had blossomed into the seeds of new friendships.  For the first time in a long while, Jenny felt a little less alone.

"Do you want to go grab a snack with us after school today?" Emily asked Jenny on Friday.

Jenny hesitated, then gathered her courage. "I'd love to."She said. 

Emily grinned. "Awesome! Let's go get some pizza."   

As Jenny walked out of the classroom with the girls, laughing at Beth's latest story, she felt closer than she ever had to finding where she belonged. The project was over, but for Jenny, this was just the beginning.
