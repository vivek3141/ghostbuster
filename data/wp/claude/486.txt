The warmongering emperor Shahraz gazed out at the battlefield from his royal tent. Two armies clashed, fighting and dying for a few feet of land. His army was winning, of course, but the loss of life troubled him.

Shahraz valued strategy and cunning over brute force. As a boy, he excelled at games that tested the mind. He wished for a way to train his military commanders using a game, instead of sacrificing soldiers. 

One night, an idea came to him in a dream. A game using carved figures representing his armyâ€”foot soldiers, cavalry, elephants, and the vizier. The figures would move across a checkered board and battle for possession of each square. The game would teach his commanders the importance of foresight, positioning, and exploiting your opponent's weaknesses.

When Shahraz awoke, he summoned his royal craftsmen and described the game in detail. They set to work carving pieces from stone and wood, rendering each figure in the colors of Shahraz's army. The king named the game "Chaturanga" after a battle formation.

The game spread quickly through Shahraz's kingdom, then to neighboring lands. With each new player, the rules evolved. The elephant and vizier became more powerful. The foot soldiers gained the ability to move sideways. The game developed a rhythm and balance all its own.

In the years that followed, Chaturanga traveled the Silk Road, capturing the imagination of all who encountered it. By the time it reached Europe, the figures had become a king, queen, bishops, knights, rooks, and pawns. And "Chaturanga" had been mispronounced as "chess."

Shahraz's dream gave the world its first strategy game. A way for rulers and commanders to hone their craft through play, instead of waging real wars and sacrificing actual lives. All in pursuit of gaining a few fateful squares and declaring victory over your opponent.
