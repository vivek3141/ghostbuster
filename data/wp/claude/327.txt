The bait 

I knew what my father did for a living. He thought I was ignorant to the sounds of screams coming from the basement, or the stench of blood permeating the house. But from an early age, I knew my father's gruesome secret. He was a serial killer who preyed on innocent victims. And I was his bait. 

He would have me play in the front yard, choreographing my moves as if I was a puppet on strings. I knew he was watching from the window, waiting for just the right target. A kind, motherly figure who couldn't resist talking to the cute little boy playing alone. He would lure them into the house with an offer of lemonade or freshly baked cookies. The basement door would shut, and the real horror would begin.

I was terrified of my father and his sinister acts. But I was only a child, and he made it very clear that if I uttered a word about it, I would become his next victim. So I stayed silent, playing the role of oblivious son and bait.

When I was 16, I had my first girlfriend, a smart and perceptive girl named Jenny. One day, she came over unexpectedly and my father's basement door was open. She saw things no person should ever see. I begged her to stay silent, fearing for her life and my own. But her moral conscience couldn't allow that. She called the police.

My father knew as soon as the police arrived who had betrayed him. His rage was like nothing I had witnessed before. I knew this would be the end of both of us. But the police arrested him before he could act on his anger. As he was dragged away in handcuffs, spewing threats, I finally felt free of his shadow. I had survived my role as the bait, and could finally start living my life. Justice had prevailed, and the bait had defeated the serial killer.
