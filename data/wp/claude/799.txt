I thought I was the villain in this tale. I had it all planned out. The traps were set, the evil plot devised, the heroes walking right into my clutches.

Then he did the unthinkable. He didn't fall for any of my tricks or schemes. He evaded every snare.  But he didn't gloat or retaliate. He just gave me that infuriating smile of his, as if he knew something I didn't. 

When I finally had him cornered, monologuing like a fool, he put his hand on my shoulder and said "It doesn't have to be this way." His eyes were unbearably kind.

In that moment, something inside me cracked. The anger and hatred drained away, leaving me hollow. I suddenly saw with awful clarity the depths I had sunk to, the hurt I had caused.

I stumbled back, everything I thought I knew in tatters around me. "What have I done?" I choked out.

He stepped forward and embraced me. Just held me as I shook. I clutched at him like a drowning man.

When my ragged breathing had quieted, he said gently, "Evil isn't born, my friend. It's made. But it can be unmade too."

I lifted my gaze to his, daring to hope for the first time. "Teach me," I whispered.

He smiled again, and this time, inexplicably, I felt myself smiling in return. "Of course," he said. "That's what I'm here for."

Maybe I wasn't the villain after all. And maybe, just maybe, this could still have a happy ending.
