The old clock ticked away the seconds, as I sat in the armchair in the dark room. Time marched on for the living, but for me it stood still. I am Death, a constant yet fleeting presence in the mortal realm. 

As I sat in silence, I contemplated the lives of the humans I will soon visit. A life is but a brief flicker in the vast expanse of time, and yet to each person their life feels enduring and permanent. Such is the illusion of life. I do not judge the choices each makes in their time—I merely arrive when I must to extinguish the light and life they hold so dear.

My job is not meant to be cruel, only impartial and inescapable. For there can be no life without its ultimate conclusion; its fragile beauty and joys made more poignant because of their fleeting nature. The short lives of humans fuel purpose and passion, creativity and love. For if life went on endlessly, would anything matter or mean quite as much?

As I contemplated the approaching end of more lives this evening, my role felt less harsh than melancholy. To know life and all its sweetness, only to have to say goodbye—that is the great tragedy that I represent as Death. The ultimate thief that comes uninvited to steal away all that is precious and dear. 

And yet, I thought, perhaps I do a kindness too. To end the suffering and pain that so often accompanies life's more joyful moments. To provide rest for the weary and closure for those left behind. I alone see the whole messy breadth of a life, the sum of its parts that create a whole person now ready to be done. There is a time for all seasons under the sun, and a time for all things to end.

The clock struck the fated hour, and so I rose from my seat. Enough contemplation— it was time now for work. I gathered my tools and set off into the night, as I have for eternity. For as long as there is life, Death must follow. Our strange dance will continue without end, an eternal paradox by which we define each other. The light shall always give way to the darkness, and death shall always contemplate life.
