I always feared death. That is, until I died myself. 

My name is Eva and I was always anxious about what comes after this life. The unknown terrified me. So I did whatever I could to avoid thinking about it - I threw myself into my career, traveled the world, fostered pets, anything to escape dwelling on the uncertainty of the future.  

That all changed the day I collapsed at work and woke up three days later in the hospital, the steady beep of machines around me. The doctors said I had died on the operating table after a ruptured brain aneurysm, but they were able to revive me after 4 minutes. Those 4 minutes changed everything.

When I died, I didn't see flashes of memories, I didn't float above myself, I didn't encounter angels or demons or ascend to some heaven or hell. Everything just went black. It was the most peaceful feeling. No fear, no anxiety, just an easy fade to black. I had spent so much of my life worrying about the end, only to find out that death was nothing at all. 

This realization filled me with a calm I had never known. I saw the world through new eyes, appreciating each moment and encounter along my journey. I reconnected with old friends, told my family how much I loved them, traveled to places I had only dreamed of before. I also changed my unhealthy habits and focused on living well.

A year to the day after my death, lying in bed, I strained to hear the hum and beep of the machines that had brought me back. But there was only silence. I knew, with a feeling of warmth and peace, that I would not wake up this time. And I smiled, so grateful for the extra year of wonderful life I had been granted, and drifted again into the velvet black.

Death found me fearless at the end, and wrapped me in the same calm blanket of rest I encountered in those 4 minutes that changed everything. I was once afraid of dying, but living well and dying with peace is all any of us can hope for. And now I know, all that awaits us at the end of the journey is quiet, dreamless sleep. So live well, my friends, and have no fear of death.
