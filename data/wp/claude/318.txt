You wake up, floating upright in a cloning tank. Your first thought is one of confusion. The last thing you remember was driving to work, like any other day. Now you are suspended in a viscous fluid, a breathing mask over your face.

Your eyes slowly adjust to your surroundings. You are in a dimly lit room filled with advanced medical equipment. Through the glass of your tank, you can see technicians in white lab coats scrambling around, checking monitors and shouting at each other. 

A flash of realization hits you. You must have gotten into a fatal accident on your way to work. But your consciousness, your memories and sense of self, must have been uploaded and saved. And now you've been downloaded into a newly cloned body.

The technological implications are staggering. But those thoughts are interrupted by a more urgent concernâ€”something seems to be going wrong with the cloning process. The frantic technicians confirm your fear.

One of them, an older man, yells "Tank 12 is rejecting the upload! We're losing vitals across the board. We need to terminate this one and start the process over."

Your heart starts to race. They are going to shut this new body down and kill you, just as you've woken up in it. You start pounding on the glass of the tank, hoping the dull thumps will get their attention. 

A younger technician glances your way and does a double take. "Sir, the clone in Tank 12 is conscious and responsive!" The others stop what they are doing and turn towards you.

The older lead technician looks stunned. "That's impossible. The cloning cycle isn't complete, it should still just be an empty vessel. The consciousness upload isn't programmed to activate for another two hours."

You gesture wildly at your breathing mask, hoping they understand you are trying to communicate. The lead technician taps at a keyboard. There is a hiss, and the viscous fluid starts to drain from the tank. Oxygen flows through your mask, allowing you to breathe freely for the first time.

As soon as the fluid has drained, the tank door swings open. The lead technician approaches you hesitantly, as if you are some unclassified lifeform. 

"You are conscious," he states, almost questioning whether he can believe his own eyes. You nod emphatically. 

His brow furrows, deep in thought. "The technology must have advanced faster than expected. An early activation of a consciousness upload into a clone has never even been theorized, let alone attempted."

Your heart is still racing. But as you look at the wonder and amazement on the faces of the technicians, you realize they mean you no harm. You raise a hand, still somewhat unsteadily, and give a little wave. 

The lead technician laughs, breaking the tense atmosphere. "Welcome back to the land of the living! It seems the reports of your death were greatly exaggerated."

You smile, overjoyed at this second chance at life you have been given, in a new body no less. Your future has never looked brighter. The possibilities seem endless. You take your first breath of fresh air and close your eyes, ready to embark on a new chapter. An extraordinary new chapter, as the first human to undergo consciousness transfer into a cloned body. You are ready to see what this future holds.
