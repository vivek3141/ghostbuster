The thick Colombian jungle stretched as far as the eye could see, an endless sea of green under the harsh sun. The air was thick and humid, filled with the sounds of birds and insects. 

Juan made his way down the winding jungle path slowly, nervously clutching the battered leather satchel under his arm. His whole body was soaked in sweat, from both the oppressive heat and the anxiety about what he was about to do.

After half an hour of walking, he came upon a clearing with an old abandoned church, half reclaimed by vines and foliage. This was the place. He walked up the creaking steps and entered the church.

At the end of the aisle stood a makeshift altar, and behind it was a large stone statue of an indigenous god, with a grotesque grinning face and curved horns. The Cocaine God.

Juan emptied the contents of his satchel onto the altar, brick after brick of pure white cocaine. He kneeled before the altar and began praying aloud, thanking the Cocaine God for his good fortune and begging for continued success in his business. 

His prayers were interrupted by a loud bang as the church doors swung open. In walked a group of heavily armed men in camouflage fatigues. Juan's heart sank as he realized who they were—the paramilitary group that had taken over this region. And they did not tolerate challenges to their power.

The leader of the group strode up to Juan, picked up a brick of cocaine and examined it. "So you have been holding out on us, Juan. Tsk tsk. You know we require a tithe from all business in our territory."

Juan sputtered in protest but quieted as the leader pulled a pistol from his belt and pressed it against Juan's head.

"I will take this offering to our leader," the leader said, gesturing to the cocaine on the altar. "As for you—say hello to the Cocaine God for me."

The last thing Juan heard was the loud bang of the pistol and the laughter of the men echoing in the empty church. The Cocaine God's thirst for blood and sacrifice had been quenched once again.
