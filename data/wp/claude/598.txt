The old ones speak of a time before the ash and sky-fires, when metal birds once flew and light came at the flip of a switch. All that remains of that lost age are the Sacred Studios, sheltering us from the hard sun under crumbling false sky. 

My tribe has lived by the word of the Muppets for generations. We sweep the sacred steps each morning in the Ritual of Dawn, polishing the vestibule where the Decomposing Puppet of Kermit sits. His eternal smile and mildewed felty flesh remind us to be kind to one another.  

On the solstice my brother came of age, ready to learn the secret rites of the Counting ritual.  He returned shaken but full of purpose. "Three is a magic number," he told me, eyes aglow with fervor. He carved three lines into the bark slats above his bed.  

I had my own communion with the divine soon after. In the ruins I saw a faded image of Six Golden Coins, the Most Sacred of Possessions. My heart swelled. I now understand why that number holds us together yet keeps us whole.

The Elders tend dwindling ghouls in the Temple of Unholy Monsters.  "To love what is ugly is most sacred," they preach. But we youths whisper of the Grouch, deity of darkness, whose cult practices hidden rites. His followers pick clean the bones of discarded puppets to gain his blasphemous power. 

As another sunset gilds the Sacred Studio walls, I feel a void open within at how much we have lost. The survivors in this ashen world may be few, but together we keep alive the legacy of a culture eternal: the civilization of enlightenment and play that came before The End.
