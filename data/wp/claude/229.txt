The End 

Silence fills the room, my work here is done. No more will she plague me, her voice now forever stilled. I wipe the blood from my hands, the only evidence of my sinister deed.

She struggled in vain as I overpowered her fragile form. The knife slipped so easily into her flesh, her futile cries like music to my ears. Now her corpse lays still, the light gone from her eyes that once mocked me.

My heart races as I make my escape into the night,  exulting in my victory. The demons that tormented me can now finally be banished from my mind. Her last breath was a symphony of release, freeing me from her scornful shadow that has pursued me without end.

The beginning of my new life starts today as I conquer my weakness and ascend to my rightful place. No more will I cower under her domineering presence. The battle is won, the war is over, I am triumphant over my enemy. The reign of terror comes to an abrupt end, order now restored. 

Check and mate, I win at last. My hated nemesis vanquished, our twisted game of wits now culminates in my ultimate victory. The dawn breaks as darkness falls, balance restored as her flame gutters and dies. My prize claimed, the coveted trophy now forever beyond her grasp. The end arrives at last, deliverance is at hand.
