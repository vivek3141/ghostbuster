The dark halls of Hell echoed with the sounds of training. I swung from chains of fire, dodging jets of flame as I made my way across the cavern. Satan watched, judging my progress. 

"Faster!" he barked, "Do you think the souls of virtuosos and prodigies will be easily won?"

I leapt forward, the heat scorching my stone flesh. Mastery of fire was just the first of endless skills I must attain.

In the fetid swamps, I wrestled demons and beasts for days without rest. I learned the secrets of the worlds, from thestring dynamics of the smallest quarks to the love life of a protozoa. 

In Belial's library, I devoured grimoire after forbidden grimoire, preparing poisons, summoning creatures both dead and alien to this reality. I learned to play every instrument, speak all tongues, and compose poetry to make angels weep. 

Satan threw every curse, every trial, every test of  wit or strength or knowledge  imaginable at me. Slowly, painfully, his rumbling approval grew. I had become a weapon of corruption, perfectly honed. When I finally ascended to the throne of bones as the bringer of eternal darkness, all souls would be within my grasp, outmatched and outwitted. The kingdom my unholy father bequeathed would stand forever in my capable and terrible hands. My training complete, Hell's reign was just beginning.
