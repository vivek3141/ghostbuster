The old logging trail was overgrown but still visible to John as he made his way through the dense forest. His backpack was heavy with supplies for his final days. After 60 years of struggling with depression, he was ready to end it. 

As he reached a small clearing, he was surprised to see another man sitting on a large rock, staring intently at a bottle of pills in his hands. John coughed to announce his presence. The man looked up, startled.

They stared at each other for a moment, an unspoken understanding passing between them. "I guess we had the same idea," the man said grimly.

John nodded. "I'm John."

"Mark," the other man replied.  

An awkward silence fell. John didn't know what to say. He had planned to find solitude, not company. But something about knowing this stranger, Mark, made his own decision feel suddenly less sure.

Mark broke the silence. "There's a nice spot further up the trail, by a creek. Quiet and peaceful. That's where I was headed." He looked at John expectantly.

John wavered. Part of him wanted to join Mark, not be alone at the end. But another part of him worried it might make it harder to follow through. "I should probably keep going on my own," he said uncertainly.

Mark's face fell. "Oh, OK, I understand. It was nice meeting you, John." He turned to continue up the trail. 

John watched Mark go and felt an odd sensation - was it hope? The possibility of connection, however fleeting, had ignited some small spark inside him. "Wait," John called out. 

Mark stopped and looked back, his expression unreadable. 

"Do you mind if I join you?" John asked. 

Mark shrugged. "If you want." But John thought he detected the hint of a smile. 

They settled by the creek, watching the water flow over smooth rocks as the woods grew dark around them. A few awkward attempts at conversation petered out, but the silence felt comfortable now, shared between unlikely companions.  

John's thoughts turned inward as night fell. Was this still what he wanted? After the long, lonely years, the brief moments of connection with Mark had reminded him of what he'd once had, and lost. His pain felt a little less sharp. 

Mark broke the long silence. "It's funny," he said. "All those people telling me life is worth living - it never made a difference. But meeting you here today...for the first time, I feel like maybe it is."

John was quiet for a long moment, realizing the truth in Mark's words. "Me too," he admitted.   

They decided to hike out together the next morning, leaving their supplies behind. A long road of healing awaited, but in that moment, a spark of hope had been enough to guide them out of the woods.
