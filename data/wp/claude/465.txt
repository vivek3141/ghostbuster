The Forgotten Voyage of 1492

Little known to most historians, Christopher Columbus was not the first European explorer to reach the Americas. That distinction belongs to a Portuguese sailor named Duarte Pacheco.

In the spring of 1492, Pacheco set sail from Lisbon, Portugal on a mission to find a new trade route to India. He commanded a small carrack called the São Cristovão with a crew of just 32 men. Pacheco sailed down the West African coast, stopping in for supplies, and then turned west into the open Atlantic.

After weeks at sea battling storms, illness, and near-mutiny, Pacheco's ship finally landed on an island in the Caribbean. The natives they encountered spoke an unfamiliar language but were friendly. Pacheco traded with them and his men explored the verdant jungle interior.

Pacheco realized this new land could be valuable to Portugal. But tragedy struck—a tribal war broke out, and Pacheco's men were caught in the middle. Half his crew were killed, and Pacheco was gravely injured. He ordered the remaining men to sail back to Portugal and report their discovery. But only 12 survivors made it home.

Pacheco did not survive the journey. But on his deathbed, he told the king of finding a "New World filled with fertile land and gold." His claims were dismissed as madness. Just months later, Columbus convinced the Spanish monarchs to finance his famous voyage.

History forgot Pacheco's pioneering journey. But recently discovered Portuguese archives prove the truth of this tale. Duarte Pacheco, not Columbus, first reached the Americas from Europe. Though Pacheco did not live to see the significance of his discovery, this forgotten voyager should finally have a place of honor among the great explorers of the Age of Discovery.
