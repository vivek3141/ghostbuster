The old warehouse loomed over the dock, holding untold secrets behind its rusty metal door. Jill walked by it every day on her way to work, always wondering what was inside. She decided today was the day to finally peek in.  

As Jill slid open the heavy door with a loud creek, a flash of movement caught the corner of her eye. I froze in place, hoping the intruder  hadn't noticed me. It was probably just a stray cat, but I couldn't risk being seen. I slid behind a stack of crates, holding my breath.

The floorboards overhead creaked as Jill walked around. What was she doing here? This was my territory. I peered around the corner to get a better look, catching a glimpse of her red jacket. She didn't seem threatening. I meowed loudly, emerging from my hiding spot. 

The meow startled me, but when I saw the orange tabby cat I breathed a sigh of relief. "Hey little guy, what are you doing in here?" I slowly approached the cat so as not to scare it off. It meowed again and rubbed against my leg, seemingly happy for the company. I bent down to pet the friendly stray.

As the woman pet me, I purred contently. Her gentle strokes felt good. I weaved between her legs, wanting more attention. She obliged, scratching under my chin. "Aren't you a sweet boy!" she exclaimed. I meowed in agreement. This warehouse wasn't so lonely with a visitor. She gave me one final pat on the head before standing up. "See you around!" she said, before walking to the door. I meowed a goodbye as she left. 

The encounter left Jill feeling uplifted for the rest of her walk to work. She was glad she finally worked up the courage to explore the old warehouse, making an unexpected new friend in the process. She planned to visit the tabby cat again soon. Meanwhile, the cat napped in a pool of sunlight, happy to have met his new human friend.
