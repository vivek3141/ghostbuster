The angel of death, Azrael, gazed down at his sleeping son, Zakariah. His mortal life had been fleeting, as all human lives were. But to Azrael, who existed outside of time, his son's 33 years seemed but a blink. 

Azrael had loved Zakariah's mother, a kind-hearted baker. He had watched her for years, enchanted by her smile and generous spirit. Though forbidden, Azrael took on human form to be with her. He knew their union could only be temporary, yet he could not resist. Zakariah was the joyous, unexpected result of their love.

As Zakariah grew, Azrael visited often, delighted by a son who was smart, funny, and cared little for material things. Zakariah lived simply but richly, bringing happiness to those around him. Azrael knew that someday he would have to bear the agony of escorting Zakariah's soul to the afterlife. But not yet. Not yet.

This morning, Azrael appeared to Zakariah in a dream. "My son," he said, "you have brought me inexpressible joy. But your time on earth is ending. Do not be afraid. I will be with you, as I always have been, as I always will be."  

Zakariah awoke with a gasp. His heart pounded as the dream faded. A feeling of peace overtook him. "Do not be afraid," the soothing words echoed.

Azrael watched in sorrow as Zakariah left his home for the last time. An accident was destined for the winding cliffside road. Azrael longed to stop it, but could not disrupt the order of things, no matter how cruel it seemed.

Zakariah's cart collided with another, tumbling down the cliff. Azrael caught Zakariah's soul as it emerged from his broken body.  He held his son tight, heart shattering.  

Zakariah looked up at his father, understanding now dawning in his eyes. "You came for me, as you promised." 

Azrael could only nod, grief rendering him mute. He had thought he understood heartbreak over the eons. But never had he felt anguish like this.

Zakariah smiled gently. "Do not be sad. You gave me the gift of life, and I lived it well. Now a new adventure begins!"

Azrael gazed at his courageous, luminous son. Though they could no longer touch, Zakariah's soul glowed with a warmth that eased Azrael's pain. His son was right; this was not truly the end. They would have eternity together, angel and mortal, father and son.  

Azrael spread his wings and Zakariah's soul took flight, hand in hand into the light. The angel of death wept at his good fortune, an immortal made human, if only for a while. His mortal son had at last come home.
