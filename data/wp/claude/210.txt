They laughed at me when I said my superpower was hydrokinesis. Said that the ability to control water was useless. They forgot that the human body is 60% water. 

I had always known I was different. Ever since I was a little girl, I could feel the water around me. At first, I thought everyone experienced the world this way. But when I made the water in the bathtub swirl into a little whirlpool for my amusement, and saw my mother's shocked face, I realized this ability was something unique to me.

My parents warned me to never show or tell anyone about my power. "They won't understand," my mother said, "and people fear what they don't understand." So I kept it bottled up inside, trying to ignore the constant thrum of water in the pipes in the walls, the droplets in the clouds overhead, the blood running through the veins of every person around me.

When I reached high school, rumors started. Little things, like pipes bursting or lights shorting out whenever I walked by. Some people called me "weird" or "creepy." The popular girls even had a nickname for me: "Witchy Woman." I couldn't control the small effects I seemed to have on water and electricity. But I never dared show the full extent of my hydrokinetic power. My parents' warnings still echoed in my mind.

That is, until the day Mark and his goons cornered me behind the science building. They jeered and poked and prodded, calling me names like "freak" and "witch." Mark, his eyes glinting with malice, grabbed me hard by the arm. "Let's see if witchy woman can use her magic now," he sneered. 

Rage and fear coursed through me. Before I knew what I was doing, I sent a shockwave of water spinning out from me. It knocked Mark and the others to the ground, soaking them. They scrambled up and backed away in terror. 

Mark pointed at me with a trembling finger. "Witch!" he screeched. 

I ran. My secret was out and now the whole school would know. I burst into tears as I stumbled into the forest behind the school. 

That's when I heard the laughter. A group of students were tramping through the forest. I froze in my tracks, but it was too late. They had seen me.

"Well, if it isn't witchy woman," a boy named Todd said. The others laughed. 

Anger surged through me again. "I have a name, you know," I snapped. 

"OK, what's your real name then?" Todd asked with a smirk.

I squared my shoulders. "My name is Hannah."

"And what exactly did you do to Mark back there, Hannah?" Todd asked, still grinning but with a glint of curiosity in his eyes.

I took a deep breath. There was no going back now. "I can control water. I'm hydrokinetic."

They burst out laughing. "Sure you are!" "The ability to control water? That's totally useless!" 

I clenched my fists, and the puddles at their feet leapt up, wrapping them in coils of water. Their laughter turned to sputters and gasps. "Not so useless now, is it?" I asked.

Todd's eyes were wide. The others were yelling in panic. I released my hold on them, letting the water splash to the ground. They stumbled back, soaked and breathing hard.

Todd held up his hands. "OK, we believe you. And we'll convince the others to leave you alone too, or else." He gave me a nod of respect.

As they hurried off, I allowed myself a small smile. My ability was not so useless after all, and no one would be calling me "witchy woman" or any other names again. I was hydrokinetic, and now, finally, the world knew it.
