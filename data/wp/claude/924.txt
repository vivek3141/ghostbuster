The incessant buzzing outside my window told me the wasps were active again. I peered out the blinds to see several wasps flying in and out of a gray, papery nest attached to a branch of the oak tree in my front yard. 

A few weeks ago, the HOA sent me a stern letter demanding that I remove the wasp’s nest “using any means necessary.” They did not care how I did it, as long as the nest was eliminated. I tried to reason with them that the wasps were not bothering anyone and were simply acting in defense of their home. The HOA president remained unmoved. According to the HOA bylaws, any nuisance or unattractive feature had to be remedied.

I really didn’t want to kill the wasps. They were just doing what came naturally to them. But I also didn’t want to be fined by the HOA. I’d lived in this house for over 20 years, and I’d never had an issue with them until now. I decided to try to deter the wasps in a humane way before resorting to more drastic measures. 

First, I set up several fans around the nest, hoping the constant breeze would annoy the wasps enough to drive them away. But the determined wasps simply flew straight into the wind, undeterred. Next, I strung up mint-scented garlands and citronella candles around the nest, both natural wasp repellents. However, the only thing that seemed to repel was my neighbors, complaining about the strange decorations and smells coming from my yard.

With time running out before HOA penalties would be imposed, I enlisted the help of my friend who was a zookeeper. She brought over a non-toxic wasp repellent spray and handed me a protective suit to wear. As night fell and the wasps retreated into their nest, we thoroughly sprayed the entrance and surrounding branches. I went to bed hoping this would finally do the trick.

The next morning, I saw the wasps emerge from their nest, dropping instantly to the ground. My heart sank; we had clearly overdosed them with the repellent. But a few minutes later, to my surprise, the wasps started flying again, seemingly unharmed. They flew straight to my neighbor’s yard and began building a new nest in their tree! I walked over and apologized for the confusion, but they were delighted the wasps had moved out.

It seemed the wasps decided on their own that my house was no longer suitable and had willingly relocated to new accommodations. I called the HOA to report the nest had been removed through natural causes. Sometimes a light, thoughtful touch achieves what brute force cannot. My yard may now be wasp-free, but I missed seeing their nest outside my window, a reminder of the wonders of nature, and the resilience of life in the face of obstacles. The HOA sees a nuisance. I see a miracle.
