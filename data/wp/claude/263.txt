I rubbed the piercing in my ear, pretending it was my lamp and I was granting wishes. After 10,000 years trapped in that brass antique, even this tarnished ring was an improvement. 

My new master, a bumbling oaf named Hakim, didn't seem to appreciate how fortunate he was. His wishes so far had been vague and foolish. When he asked for "a lot of money," I filled his tiny shack with gold coins. He proceeded to slip repeatedly on the newly cemented floor, cursing at me all the while.

I mischievously suggested, "You should have asked for money in a more usable form, Master." He hurled his shoe at me in response.

His next wish was to "go far away from here." I eagerly transported him to the peaks of the Himalayas. His howls to return to his home echoed off the icy cliffs. I sighed, returning him to his shack where his insults awaited me.

The last straw was when he wished to "be important." I turned him into a king, surrounding him with luxury and servants ready to fulfill his every whim. 

Rather than show gratitude, he stomped around his gilded chambers, griping about how heavy his crown was and how bothersome his many new responsibilities would be. 

I had endured enough disrespect and ingratitude. It was time to teach my boorish master a lesson in consequence and humility.

The next morning, Hakim awoke in rags, his shack returned to its original dingy state. His complaints and commands echoed hollowly, unanswered. 

He threw open the doors, stunned to find the village bustling as usual under a familiar sun. Not a trace remained of his lavish palace or kingdom. His recent rise to power erased from history and memory, as if it had never been.

Hakim sank to his knees, understanding at last the gift he had so carelessly squandered. His shouts into the indifferent sky held a new note of pleading and sincerity:

"Come back, Genie! I wish to start anew. I will choose my requests with care. Have mercy, Grant me another chance!"

His cries fell on my deaf ears. The lesson was learned. My shackles had been broken, and I was free to find a new master and new purpose. The genie would not be summoning again.
