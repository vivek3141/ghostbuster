I couldn't believe it. One minute I was walking down the street, minding my own business, and the next minute I was pulled into a dark alley by a pale, sinister looking man. 

"Don't be scared," he said in a thick Eastern European accent. "I've been watching you. I know you're vegan. I respect that. But I'm going to turn you now. I'm a vampire. I have been for over 1,000 years."

I opened my mouth to scream but nothing came out. This was a nightmare. Vampires weren't real. But his eyes glowed red and his fangs shone in the dim light. He lunged at my neck and pierced my skin with his sharp teeth. My blood flowed out of me as my vision went dark.

I awoke with a gasp. At first I thought it was just a terrible dream. But then I felt the twin puncture wounds in my neck. I stumbled to the mirror. My reflection was pale as death and my eyes shone crimson. I screamed. 

The vampire appeared behind me in an instant and grabbed my shoulders. "You're in transition now. The only way to complete the transformation is to feed on human blood. But don't worry, I'll guide you to only feed on corrupt and evil humans. Your vegan sensibilities can remain intact."

I shuddered at the thought of hurting anyone. "I never wanted this!" I screamed. "You had no right!"

"I've given you eternal life and powers you can barely comprehend. You should be thanking me." His eyes glowed with anger and impatience.

I shook my head vehemently. "I don't want to hurt people. I don't want eternal life if it means sacrificing my morals and humanity!"

The vampire sighed. "I was afraid of this. Very well, there is another way, but I warn you - it won't be pleasant. If you don't feed within 24 hours, you will die. But if that is your wish, so be it." He disappeared in the blink of an eye, leaving me alone with my fate.

The next 24 hours were torture. My throat burned with thirst and my senses were overwhelmed by the sound of heartbeats and the smell of blood all around me. Several times I nearly lost control, but just managed to restrain myself before hurting anyone. 

Finally, the deadline arrived. I stumbled to my darkened bedroom, awaiting the end. But it never came.

The vampire was there. "It seems your willpower and conviction have saved you," he said grudgingly. "You remained pure and didn't hurt a soul. The transformation will reverse. You will become human again." 

Joy flooded through me upon hearing those words. My throat cooled and my senses dulled to normal human levels. My reflection was no longer pale but full of color again. 

"Thank you," I said to the vampire. I now felt a strange camaraderie with this being who had been undead for over a millennium. 

"No, thank you," he replied. "You reminded me what it is to be human. I will now meet the sun and finally rest."

With that, he opened the curtain flooding the room with warm sunlight. His skin sparkled briefly then disintegrated to dust before my eyes. I breathed a sigh of relief, overjoyed at my second chance at life.
