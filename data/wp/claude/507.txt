You were hiking through the dense forest,following a trail you had never explored before. The canopy of trees overhead obscured most of the sunlight, giving the woods a dim and primeval feel. 

As you hiked around a large rocky outcrop, you suddenly stumbled upon something completely out of place. There, half buried in the undergrowth, was a giant metallic object. It was oval in shape, about 30 feet long, and had a dull gray surface covered in strange symbols and markings.

Your heart raced. This couldn't be man-made. It looked utterly alien. You slowly approached the object, brushing away vines and plants to get a better view. You found an opening, a door of some kind, and peered inside. The interior was dark, but you could make out a high-tech cockpit and control panels.

Suddenly, a humming sound emerged from the craft, and the interior started to glow. Lights flickered on across control panels and the craft shuddered. You stumbled back, unsure of what was happening. Before you could react, a mechanical arm extended swiftly from the opening, planted itself in the ground, and pulled the rest of the craft out from its resting place. 

You stood stunned as the massive object, now free of its earthly tomb, rotated and moved, shaking off centuries of dirt and debris. Then a booming, metallic voice emerged from the craft.

"Scanning...environment analyzed. Location: Planet Earth, Sol System. Temporal scan indicates crash landing occurred 973 local Earth years ago. Activating repair protocols."

Your mind raced. Had this thing really crashed almost 1000 years ago? What was it? Where did it come from?

The craft floated silently a few feet off the ground. More arms and robotic extensions emerged, removing dents and repairing damage on the exterior shell of the object. 

"Repairs complete. Power levels restored to 83%. Activating exploration protocols and scanning for native sentient lifeforms."

A bright light shone from the craft, sweeping the area. It moved over you, and the booming voice spoke again.

"Sentient lifeform detected. Analyzing...bipedal humanoid creature. Estimated technological level far below spacefaring capabilities."

Your heart was pounding in your chest. What should you do? Run? Hide? Try to communicate?

Before you could decide, the light intensified and you found yourself floating off the ground, being pulled toward the massive alien object. As everything faded to black, your mind wondered what possible fate awaited you inside that gigantic, ancient alien craft.
