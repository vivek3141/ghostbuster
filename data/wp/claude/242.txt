The dingy alley was dark, save for a single lamp flickering above a heavy metal door. Jake pulled his coat tighter and knocked three times, paused, then knocked twice more. The slit in the door slid open. 

"Yeah?" The gruff voice asked.

"I'm here to buy." Jake replied. The man behind the door grunted and unlatched the series of locks. The door creaked open. Jake slipped inside, his heart pounding.

Jake had heard rumors of this black market for years but only now worked up the courage to see if they were true. Inside the room were several strange machines with wires and helmets attached. His contact, a large man with a long beard, stood behind a table.

"Who you lookin' to buy from?" The man asked.

"My wife, Clara." Jake said, pulling an old photo from his wallet. "She passed a few years ago."

The man took the photo and examined it. "Yeah, I got a few vials of her in stock. Prime memories from when you two was first married, looks like." 

Jake felt a mixture of anticipation and disgust. "How much?"  

"For you, since it's your wife, I can do five grand for two vials."

Jake handed over the cash. His entire savings, but it would be worth it to see Clara again, even just in memory.

The man retrieved two small glass vials filled with a silvery liquid and placed them in Jake's outstretched hands. "Plug in, put the helmet on, and pour one vial in. You'll go right into the memory for about 5 minutes. Once it's done, wait a few minutes before the next vial. Have a good trip, and my condolences."

Jake sat in one of the strange machines, attached the helmet and wires, and poured one vial into the helmet's opening. There was a metallic click and whirring sound. And then...

He was in their old apartment, Clara laughing and spinning in her white wedding dress. Her smile was radiant as she pulled him in for a kiss. It felt so real. He knew it was just a memory, but his heart swelled with love and grief anew. 

Too soon, the memory faded and he found himself back in the dingy room. He was in tears, mourning Clara's loss for a second time. But he poured the second vial in, desperate to stay with her, if only in his mind.  

More memories flashed by, memories of tender moments and inside jokes and the deep love they shared. He clung to every second, even as he knew these were just echoes of the past. 

Finally the last memory faded away. He tore the helmet off and collapsed into tears. The memories were a balm and yet stoked the anguish of missing her.

The bearded man came over cautiously. "Doing alright there, friend?"  

Jake stood on shaky legs and wiped his eyes. "Thank you. That was worth more than you could know." He made his way to the door and out into the night, memories of Clara tucked close to his heart. She was gone, but for a few precious minutes, they were together again. The black market had given him a gift beyond price: a chance to be with his love once more.
