The thick, crimson blood dripped from the edge of his blade onto the hard stone floor. Victor kneeled down and smeared the fresh blood onto the hem of her white robe. 

"A gift, my lady. I have rid the kingdom of another threat, as you commanded," he said, his head bowed.

The queen stood silently, looking down at him from her throne. After a moment, she spoke. "Rise, Victor of Blackstone. You have served your kingdom well once again."

Victor stood up and sheathed his sword. His armor was dented and scratched, his face haggard from days of tracking his target. But his blue eyes shone with a fierce loyalty as he gazed at the queen. 

She was a vision in her white furs and silver crown, her beauty as piercing as the winter frost outside the castle walls. But behind those icy looks lurked a cunning and ruthlessness that had allowed her to gain power where no woman had before.

"The northern warlords will think twice now before questioning your rule," Victor said. "When they receive the head of their leader, they will understand the fate of those who dare oppose you."

The queen's red lips curved into a satisfied smile. "You have proven yourself a formidable weapon for my arsenal once again. The days of men dismissing me as a mere figurehead are over. With you enforcing my will, none shall challenge me."

Victor bowed again. "My sword is yours, my lady. I live to serve and protect your reign."

"And you shall be richly rewarded," the queen said. She raised a hand, and attendants hurried forward with chests of gold and jewels, which they poured at Victor's feet. 

Victor glanced at the treasure indifferently. "I fight for your glory, not gold."

"And that is why you are my most prized warrior." The queen stood up and descended from the throne. Victor bowed his head as she approached, her fur-lined cloak trailing behind her.

She stopped before him and placed a pale, slender hand on his blood-smeared cheek. "Rise, my champion, and receive your queen's favor."

Victor raised his head and took her hand, pressing his lips to her icy skin. She smiled at him, her black eyes gleaming with a hunger of her own as she regarded her most loyal subject. Victor grasped his sword hilt tightly, his blood racing with a desire to serve his queen in any way she wished.

The queen turned her hand within his and led him away from the throne, the attendants bowing hastily as they passed. Victory followed willingly, ready as always to fulfill her every command. His life belonged to her, the cold and cunning queen who sought to domination with him as her blade - and he would have it no other way.
