You blinked awake to the rays of the morning sun filtering through your curtains. You yawned and stretched, ready to start your day. As you swung your legs over the side of the bed, your feet hit the hardwood floor. 

But something felt off. The floor felt strangely slippery under your bare feet. You looked down and gasped. The floor was sparkling clean, shining as if freshly polished. There wasn't a speck of dirt or dust to be seen.

You glanced around the room in confusion and your eyes landed on your bedside table. The ring of condensation from the glass of water you had left there the night before had disappeared. In fact, the entire table surface looked freshly wiped down.

With a start, you realized that when you had stepped onto the floor, you had accidentally placed your hand on the ground to steady yourself. And now the section of floor under your hand was spotless.

Your mind raced as the implications became clear. Somehow, in the night, you had gained the power to instantly clean any surface just by touching it. 

You tentatively reached out a finger and touched the wall next to your bed. A clean spot appeared, spreading outwards from your fingertip. You gasped again. This was real. You had the power to instantly banish dirt and filth.

A smile spread across your face as you considered the possibilities. No more hours of tedious cleaning and chores. With just a brush of your hand, you could make any mess in your home disappear. You had been given an incredible gift. The power of perfect cleanliness was at your very fingertips.
