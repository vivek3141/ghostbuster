Jake walked into the gymnasium of his old high school, feeling a mix of nostalgia and anxiety. He hadn't stepped foot in here for 10 years, not since graduating at the top of his class as the star quarterback. 

He scanned the room, recognizing a few faces of former classmates. Some looked virtually unchanged, as if no time had passed. Others looked aged beyond their years.

Then he spotted a familiar figure across the room. It was his old friend Mark, the guy who had been by his side since elementary school. They had been inseparable for years until their lives took them in vastly different directions after high school. 

Jake made his way over, a smile breaking across his face. "Mark, buddy, how are you?" he said, embracing his friend. 

Mark smiled back brightly. "Jake, it's so good to see you. It's been way too long."

They took a step back and looked at each other, assessing the changes 10 years had wrought. Mark looked good, Jake thought, dressed impeccably in an expensive suit and tie. His smile lines had deepened but he still had the same easygoing demeanor.

"You look great," Jake said. "How have you been?"

"I can't complain," Mark replied. "Loving my work, traveling a lot. How about you?"  

Jake hesitated. "I've been keeping busy too," he said vaguely. "Working on some exciting new projects."

"Always the overachiever, aren't you." Mark slapped him on the back. "Come on, let's get a drink. We've got a lot to catch up on."

They made their way to the bar and grabbed some beers. "So what line of work are you in these days?" Jake asked tentatively. 

Mark took a long sip of his beer. "I'm in government work," he said. "Just got re-elected to my second term in Congress."

Jake blinked,too dumbfounded to respond. Congress? His slacker friend Mark who had barely graduated?

Mark peered at him curiously. "How about you, Jake? What have you made of yourself over the years?"

Jake's smile faded. Here was the reckoning he had dreaded. "I've had some ups and downs," he said slowly. "To be honest, I'm just trying to get my life back together. I was...addicted to heroin for a long time. But I've been clean now for 8 months." He looked down, ashamed.

There was a long pause. Then Mark gripped his shoulder. "Jake, that's incredible. I'm really proud of you, man." 

Jake looked up to see Mark's kind, earnest eyesâ€”the same as when they were kids. And in that moment, the years melted away. They were just two old friends, accepting each other as they always had.
