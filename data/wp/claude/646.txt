I peered through the scope of my sniper rifle, the crosshairs trained on the man in the crisp gray suit. He strode across the busy New York street, blissfully unaware he was in my sights. 

10 years ago, James left me for dead in the mountains of Afghanistan. As the unit medic, he declared me too injured to make the trek to safety. "We have to leave him behind! He isn't going to make it!" They abandoned me, taking my gear and supplies.

They thought the cold or the Taliban would finish me. But I survived. I crawled into a cave and treated my own wounds. I lived off the land for weeks before finding a remote village that took me in. It took me years to make my way home, always with one single thought in my mind: revenge.

I exhaled slowly and squeezed the trigger. The man in the gray suit clutched his neck and collapsed onto the sidewalk. In the chaos of the screaming crowd, I disassembled my rifle and slipped away.

That night I watched the news, seeing the report of a mysterious sniper in New York who assassinated a decorated military veteran, James Woods. The reporter called it a "senseless act of violence".  If only they knew.

A few days later, a black sedan pulled up outside my apartment. Two stern-faced men in suits stepped out. I knew this was coming. I had been preparing for a decade.

I opened the door. "Can I help you gentlemen?"

"Lieutenant Dan Stevens?" one asked. I nodded. "We need you to come with us regarding the death of Captain James Woods."

A smile tugged at the corner of my mouth. "Of course. I've been waiting for this for a long time."

Their eyes narrowed, confused and suspicious. They would not understand, not yet. But they would. Once they saw my military records, my background, my motive. How sweet revenge was, even if it came at the cost of my freedom. The thought filled me with a peace I had not felt in 10 long years.

Justice had finally been served. My debt paid in full. I was ready for whatever came next.
