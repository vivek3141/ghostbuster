Modor the Destructor gazed out at the crumbling ruins of the city, smoke rising from shattered buildings. His rampage was complete. But he felt no joy or satisfaction, just a deep exhaustion. 

The source of his immense power, the energy that allowed him to level cities with a flick of his wrist, was a 2 year old child named Timmy. Timmy's endless curiosity and imagination fueled Modor's destruction. But with Timmy came endless questions.

"Why did you smash that building?" Timmy would ask. "Can we build something now? I want to make a zoo! And a spaceship!" On and on Timmy's questions and ideas would pour out, powering Modor's rampages.

Modor sighed, his massive shoulders slumping. Timmy meant well. But Modor was not cut out to be a playmate. He only knew how to destroy, not create.  

Timmy ran up, eyes shining. "Modor! Modor! I have the best idea. Let's build a huge fortress, with a moat and a drawbridge and--"

"Enough!" Modor bellowed. Timmy froze. "I...I cannot do what you ask," Modor said, more gently.  

Timmy's little face fell. "But...we're a team."  

Modor knelt down. "You gave me a great gift, little one. But I was not made to build. Only to tear down." He set Timmy on the ground. "Go. Use your gift for good."

As Timmy toddled off, Modor wondered if ultimate power was worth the cost. He had no place in Timmy's world of creation. His purpose was destruction. And nothing more.
