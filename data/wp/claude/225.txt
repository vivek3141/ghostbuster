The Words on My Skin

The black script curled around my ribcage, just under my left breast. I had memorized the letters long ago, wondering when and how I would hear that short sentence uttered. 

"I love you too."

My parents told me the words appeared on my skin the day I was born. Everyone was born with the last words their soulmate would say to them - a final message of love and connection. I used to dream of the moment I would hear those words, see the love in his eyes as he said them. But as I grew into my teenage years, cynicism crept in. What if I never found my soulmate? What if the words were a cruel trick and meant nothing?

I tried to push it all from my mind as I focused on my career. I became a journalist and traveled the world, interviewing people and telling their stories. My work was fulfilling, but in the corners of my heart I still longed to find the person who would say the words that were engraved on me. 

While on assignment in Spain, I met a photographer named Miguel. Working together, we had an instant connection. Over late night drinks discussing stories we wanted to tell, our hands brushed and my skin tingled. I felt myself falling fast. Miguel seemed to feel the same, and soon our partnership turned romantic.

A year later, Miguel joined me on an assignment in Brazil. We were walking along a beach at sunset, his arm around me, laughing together with pure joy. In that moment, bathed in golden light, Miguel turned to me and spoke the words I had been waiting to hear for decades: "I love you too."

I gasped, grabbing his arm. He looked alarmed and pulled back to see my reaction. I stammered out an explanation about the words on my skin, tears filling my eyes. At first, Miguel looked confused, then awestruck. He brushed his fingers over the spot where he now knew the words were imprinted. 

"You mean..." he said slowly, "we are meant to be? We are soulmates?" His face lit up with a smile and laughter bubbled up between us. We danced together on the sand, celebrating a love destined to be. My cynicism had vanished in the glow of finding my soulmate at last.

The next morning, I woke with my face still alight with joy. Miguel stirred next to me and gazed at me with peaceful wonder. I smiled back, reaching out to brush the hair off his forehead.

"Good morning," I said softly. He opened his mouth to respond, but before he could utter a sound, his eyes rolled back and his body began to convulse violently. I screamed for help as a lethal seizure overtook him. By the time the paramedics arrived, my soulmate had breathed his last breath. 

As I cradled Miguel's body, my fingertips traced over the familiar words on my skin. The last words he had said to me. I now understood the bitter truth - that I would carry these words with me for the rest of my days, a reminder of a love found and lost in a fleeting moment on a distant beach. A love as eternal as the words engraved upon me.
