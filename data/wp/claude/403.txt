I clicked the "Randomize Playlist" button and hit play. The opening bassline of "Thriller" by Michael Jackson started pumping through the speakers. Of course, it had to be that song.

It was a dark and stormy night. The wind rustled through the trees outside, thunder rumbled in the distance. I was alone in my creaky old house, curled up on the couch watching a scary movie.

As the familiar ominous music started, shivers ran down my spine. The film on the TV showed a spooky full moon rising over a foggy lake. I already regretted picking a horror film to watch by myself at midnight.

Suddenly, the power went out. The TV flicked off, the lights shut off, and the whole house was plunged into darkness. A loud bang came from the hallway, as if something had fallen over. Or maybe it wasn't just something fallingâ€”it sounded like heavy footsteps. I froze in terror, my heart pounding. 

A loud groan came from the darkness, and the floorboards outside the living room squeaked under shuffling feet. Something was out there. I sat petrified, hoping it was just the wind playing tricks on my overactive imagination. 

The shuffling and groaning got closer, moving slowly down the hallway, getting nearer and nearer to the living room with each passing second. I had to get out of there. But I couldn't see a thing, and had no idea where the figure in the dark was standing. I felt around for any kind of weapon to defend myself but came up empty-handed.

A dark shape appeared in the doorway, lurching forward. Lightning flashed, illuminating the hideous undead creature for a split second. Its decaying flesh and torn clothing dripping with blood, lifeless eyes glowing, jagged teeth bared. I opened my mouth to scream as a ice-cold hand grasped my arm, but no sound came out. The creature leaned in close as I struggled helplessly, its foul breath on my face, ready to feast. And then...

The power came back on. The TV blinked, showing the DVD menu screen. My living room was empty. I was alone. No zombies, no creatures, no anything. Just my overactive imagination fueled by an spooky Michael Jackson song on a dark and stormy night. I laughed in relief and embarrassment at how freaked out I had gotten. As I got up to pour myself a stiff drink, I made a mental note: no more scary movies and random playlists late at night!
