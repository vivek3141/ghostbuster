The rustle of leaves outside his window startled Timmy awake. The six-year-old sat up in bed, his heart pounding. The familiar panic rose in his chest as his eyes darted around the shadowy room. 

His parents always left the hall light on, but tonight it seemed dimmer than usual. The familiar shapes of his furniture seemed sinister in the half-light. As another gust of wind rattled the branches outside, Timmy whimpered and pulled his blankets up around his chin.

He knew it was silly to be scared of the dark at his age. His older brother Jack, who was eight, teased him for still sleeping with a night light. But Jack didn’t understand. He didn’t know about the Bogeyman. 

Timmy had first heard about the Bogeyman from his friend Billy at school. Billy said the Bogeyman was a monster who prowled the night, looking for little children out of bed to gobble up. Timmy tried not to believe it was true, but some nights he was sure he heard the Bogeyman scratching at his window or rattling the doorknob. His parents insisted the Bogeyman wasn’t real, but still, they always left the hall light on for him at night.

Another floorboard creaked downstairs, and Timmy gasped. His heart pounding in his ears, he clutched his favorite stuffed animal, a ragged bunny named Hoppy, to his chest. He considered running to his parents’ room but worried the Bogeyman might grab him if he stepped out from under the covers.

From downstairs came another creak, then the sound of heavy, uneven footsteps slowly climbing the stairs. The Bogeyman! Timmy squeezed his eyes shut, hot tears running down his face as he braced to be grabbed by a scaly, clawed hand.

The footsteps came closer and closer until they stopped right outside his door. Timmy held his breath, clinging to Hoppy with all his might. The door slowly creaked open. Timmy hid under the covers, shaking like a leaf.

“Timmy?” croaked a gravelly voice. Timmy whimpered, refusing to come out from under the blankets. A scrape of claws on wood, then a heavy sigh.

“Come now, child, don't be afraid. I'm not going to hurt you.” The voice was gentler now. Timmy poked one eye out from under the covers. 

A gnarled, shadowy figure stood in the doorway, pale moonlight glinting off its pale eyes. It was the Bogeyman! But he didn’t sound mean. Timmy emerged a little more from under the covers.

The Bogeyman gave him a crooked smile. “There now, that’s better. Sorry if I gave you a fright. I didn’t mean to wake you, child.”

Timmy found his voice. “A-are you going to gobble me up?”

The Bogeyman chuckled. “Of course not. I’m not here to hurt little ones like yourself. I’m here to protect them.”

Timmy frowned. “Protect them from what?”

The Bogeyman’s smile faded. “From the real monsters that lurk outside. I scare them away and make sure they don’t hurt children in the night. I don't mean children any harm. I just want them to stay safe in their beds after dark.” His gnarled hand reached out slowly, gently ruffling Timmy’s hair. “You don’t need to be afraid of me, child. I’ll keep you safe.”

Timmy leaned into the Bogeyman’s touch, warmth blossoming in his chest where panic had been before. He gave the Bogeyman a smile. “Thank you for protecting me, Mr. Bogeyman.”

The Bogeyman shook his head. “No need to call me 'mister'. Just Bogeyman will do.” He walked to the window, peering outside with a scowl before pulling the curtains shut tight. “Now off to bed with you. I've got to get back to patrolling before the real nasties come out!”

Timmy snuggled under his covers, Hoppy held fast in his arms. “Goodnight, Bogeyman!” he called. 

“Goodnight, child,” came the croaking reply as heavy footsteps retreated from his room. Timmy smiled contentedly, his fears of the darkness finally at an end, as he drifted off to sleep under the watchful gaze of his unlikely guardian.
