The old stone walls of the abandoned fire guild hall stood silent as Ethos paced outside. Once, laughter and the roar of flames filled these halls, but now only dust and cobwebs remained. Ethos was now the last remaining fire mage, though his powers had always been less than impressive. Still, he felt a duty to keep the ancient traditions alive. 

As Ethos paced, a young mage named Jera strode up the path. She had shown promise with her powers over fire and Ethos hoped to convince her to join the guild, to learn the old ways before they were lost forever.

Jera approached, her bright eyes taking in the crumbling guild hall. "Master Ethos, I came as you asked. You said you had something important to show me?"

Ethos bowed. "Welcome, Jera. I have asked you here to offer you the chance to join the fire guild and become an apprentice in the ancient arts of flame and fire."

Jera looked at the abandoned building. "But the old guild, it's gone, isn't it?"

"The guild lives on, in those who carry its teachings," Ethos said calmly. "I am the last mage left from the old days, and I have been searching for one worthy to become my apprentice before the knowledge is lost." 

"And you think I have potential?" Jera asked. She summoned a small flame to dance across her fingertips, lighting her eyes with flickering orange light. The flames reflected Ethos' creased and careworn face.

"You have a gift," Ethos said. "With training, you could become a great mage."

Jera let the flame sputter out. "Show me what you can do."

Ethos swallowed hard. This was the part he had dreaded. He held out his hands, channeling his energy and magic. A few feeble sparks flickered to life in his palms and just as quickly died.

Jera crossed her arms. "That's the great power of the fire guild? That's what you'll teach me?"  

Ethos' shoulders slumped. "I have never been as gifted as the other mages. But I studied for years, learning the old ways at the knee of the former guild master. Knowledge and technique, not raw power, are the true teachings I have to pass on."

Jera considered this. "I want to learn from the best. Can you really make me a great mage?"

Ethos saw his vision dying in the hesitation in her eyes. But he would not lie. "I can teach you all I know, pass on the wisdom of generations of fire mages. I can help strengthen your gift and provide guidance. But greatness will depend on you. All I ask is the chance to share the teachings of the guild before they disappear forever."

Jera was silent for a long moment. Then she nodded. "Very well, Master Ethos. I will join your guild."

Pure relief and joy flooded Ethos' heart. The fire guild's light would not die out today. But there was no time to waste. The lessons of a lifetime waited to be shared with this new apprentice, Jera, who might one day rekindle the fire guild's flame.
