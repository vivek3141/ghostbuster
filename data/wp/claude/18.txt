The vast hull of the X'tac ship emerged a million miles from the surface of the earth. Hatu sat in his chrome throne in the control room, gazing at the blue planet slowly spinning beneath them.  

They'd sent scouts eons ago and now the time to reap the planet's bounty had come. He lifted his fingers in an almost absent gesture. Beside him, his second barked out the orders. All around him, subordinates scurried around, beginning the assault.  

Canisters of poison shot out from the cannons. The canisters had been made to explode upon entry into the atmosphere. The acid would vaporize, but then, when it rained, it would rain acid.  

All there was left to do now was wait and Hatu was patient.

Hatu's people had drifted through the galaxy, conquering world after world, harvesting each for its resources before moving on. This small planet in an insignificant part of the spiral arm would fall as the others had. Their superior technology and biology had led to victory after victory.

The poison canisters burst in the skies above, unseen by the creatures below. In the coming rainfall, the acid would pour from the heavens, seeping into the soil, the lakes and rivers, the very cells of every lifeform.

Hatu thought of the places now devoid of life, mined bare and left behind, a graveyard of worlds in their wake. But sentimentality was for the weak. His was the way of survival, of endurance, and if others had to fall to ensure his race lived on, so be it. 

The rains began to fall. Below, creatures started to scream.
