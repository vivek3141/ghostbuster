The Review Must Be Glowing 

Jenny sat at her desk, staring at the blank screen.  Her deadline for the review of Clarence Buckingham's latest book was looming, but she couldn't bring herself to start writing. The book was terrible. A nonsensical jumble of shallow characters, improbable plot twists and insipid prose. Her reputation as a discerning and respected book critic was at stake. 

But her wallet was even more at stake. Buckingham's publisher had offered her an "additional fee" of $20,000 on top of her normal review fee if the review was a "rave." They knew the book was awful too. But Buckingham's name alone would guarantee sales, as long as the first reviews were glowing.

Jenny leaned back in her chair, biting her lip. Her credit card bills were piling up. The mortgage on her condo was due. Her daughter's college tuition payment deadline was next week. $20,000 would solve a lot of problems. But could she sacrifice her integrity for that amount?
 Would readers ever trust her reviews again if she called this disaster of a book "the must-read triumph of the year"?

The phone rang, jarring Jenny from her anguish. It was Elena, her editor. "Jenny, I'm still waiting for the Buckingham review! The publishing house is eager to release it and start promoting the book. Have you finished it yet?"

Jenny took a deep breath. She had made her choice—she couldn't pass up the money. "Almost done. Should have it to you within the hour," she said. She started typing, summoning all her writing skills to craft a review that would satisfy the publishers while not entirely compromising her self-respect.

An hour later, Jenny pressed Send. The glowing yet carefully worded review was done. She had praised the "intricate subplots" (which were incoherent), lauded the "lyrical writing" (which was pedestrian) and called the book "a moving and unforgettable experience" (which it most certainly was not). The $20,000 had better clear quickly, she thought. She needed a drink to wash away the bad taste in her mouth from that review.

Her review published, the promotional machine kicked into high gear. Clarence Buckingham's book soared to the top of the bestseller lists, buoyed by Jenny's praise and the hype from Buckingham's publisher. They had achieved what they wanted. 

Jenny achieved what she wanted too—her bank account balance problem was solved. But as more lackluster reviews trickled in, followed by readers' disappointed reactions, her credibility took a blow. Her calls and emails were  increasingly  harsh. Jenny knew her glowing review of that train wreck of a book would haunt her for years in her profession. But as  long as her money troubles were resolved, that was a consequence she would have to live with. One corrupt review—and $20,000—had bought her soul.
