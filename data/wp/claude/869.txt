The Gilded Orb 

The old watchmaker lifted the gilded orb from its velvet case with aged, careful hands. "This is a pocket watch," he said slowly, holding it up for the young boy to see. 

The boy gazed at the strange object, mesmerized by the intricate engravings on its golden surface but perplexed by its purpose. "What does it do?" he asked.

The watchmaker smiled, remembering a time when he too did not understand the workings of time. "This pocket watch keeps time and measure the passing of hours, minutes and seconds. Though you cannot see them, inside this orb are many moving parts - gears and springs and levers - that turn and spin and rotate in a perfectly choreographed dance."

The boy looked skeptical. How could this little golden ball keep track of something as ephemeral as the passing of time? 

"Here, hold out your hand," said the watchmaker. He gently placed the watch in the boy's palm.

The boy felt the cool, smooth metal and the subtle weight and contours of the watch. Suddenly, he sensed a faint pulse, a tiny beat that seemed for form within the watch, regular as a heartbeat. His eyes grew wide. "It's alive!" he exclaimed.  

The watchmaker chuckled. "No, it only simulates life. With its steady beat - we call them ticks - it can split a day into equal parts. So we can tell the difference between a second and a minute, an hour and a day. Though time itself remains unseen, this little orb makes its passage visible - it gives us a glimpse of that fleeting force that animates the world, pulling us along steadily toward the future, second after second."

The boy listened, enchanted, as the watchmaker wound up the gilded timekeeper, setting its heart  afresh. The old but steady beat filled the room, each tick a monument to the moments we are given, and the moments we must let go.
