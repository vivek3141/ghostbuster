The Retired Villain 

Jake leaned against the wall of the First National Bank, watching his 6-year-old daughter Jenny play with the wooden blocks in the kid's area. His villain days were long behind him, and now he was just a regular dad. 

As Jenny built a tower as tall as herself, Jake noticed a group of suspicious looking characters enter the bank. His villain senses started tingling. These were not regular customers.

Three men and a woman, all in long coats and sunglasses, approached the tellers. A fifth figure, a huge hulking brute of a man, stood by the door, his arms crossed menacingly.

Jake's fears were confirmed when the apparent leader of the group suddenly leapt onto the counter and fired an explosive blast into the ceiling from his weird-looking gauntlets.

"Everybody on the ground now!" he bellowed. "This is a robbery! Anyone tries to be a hero, you get a face full of plasma!"

The customers shrieked and dropped to the floor. The tellers hastily loaded cash into the bags the robbers had tossed them.

Jake snatched up Jenny and pulled her close, hiding her face in his shoulder. His mind raced. These guys meant business. He wasn't that kind of villain anymore, but he might have to do something. He couldn't let Jenny get hurt.

The thugs were making their way through the bank, gathering more loot and harassing the cowering customers. The brute was still by the door but turned away for a moment. 

Jake saw his chance. "Stay here, be quiet," he whispered to Jenny. He dashed to an unattended computer and accessed the security system, triggering the alarm.

The robbers panicked at the sudden blaring siren and flashing red lights. "The cops will be here any minute!" their leader growled. "Grab what you can and let's get out of here!"

They sprinted for the exits, shoving past the brute, who was confused by his associates abandoning their plan. Jake rushed out from behind the counter and delivered a swift uppercut to the brute's jaw, knocking him out cold.

"Daddy!" Jenny cried, running to Jake, who scooped her up, reassuring her. Sirens were approaching outside.  Jake smiled, glad to have thwarted the heist without revealing his villainous past. His days of evil were done, but he could still make use of his skills if needed to protect the city and those he loved.
