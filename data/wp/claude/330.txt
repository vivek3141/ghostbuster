The arbitrator sighed as she reviewed the file in front of her. Another tough case. The soul in question, a Mr. Smith, had lived an exemplary life of balance. For every bad deed, he had done an equally good one. He donated as much to charity as he took in unethical business deals. He volunteered as many hours as he spent wasting time. 

As Mr. Smith's time on Earth came to an end, neither Heaven nor Hell knew where to place him. He had not been good enough for the former, but not bad enough for the latter. And so his fate fell into the hands of the arbitrator, a neutral third-party, to determine the final destination of balanced souls.

The arbitrator rubbed her temples. "Send him in," she called to the bailiff.

The doors opened, and Mr. Smith shuffled in. He looked utterly unremarkable: average height, average build, balding, with a forgettable face. 

"Mr. Smith," the arbitrator began, "your case has been reviewed. It seems you lived a life of almost perfect balance between good and evil. I will ask you some questions to determine whether your final place shall be Heaven or Hell."

Mr. Smith shrugged. "As you wish, though I didn't live my life for reward or punishment, just to achieve equilibrium."  

The arbitrator ignored this. "As a child, did you ever swat a fly or pull the legs off an insect?" she asked.

"Of course. But I also showed kindness to animals. I gave stray dogs food and water."

The arbitrator noted this. "Did you ever lie to avoid discomfort?" 

"Yes, but I told the truth when it really mattered." 

"Did you ever cheat on an exam or romantic partner?"

"I have. But I was faithful and honest at other times." 

On and on it went, a perfect counterbalance for each act, moral or immoral. Mr. Smith began to annoy the arbitrator. How could anyone live such a life of neutrality, never striving for betterment or caring for the impact of their actions?

Finally, she asked, "Why should you be admitted to Heaven, Mr. Smith?"

He shrugged again. "I have as equal a claim to Heaven as to Hell. My life caused as much good as harm. My soul will go where it must to maintain the balance."

The arbitrator had heard enough. "I have made my decision, Mr. Smith. The refusal to strive for good, to work to better yourself and make amends for wrongs, does not equate to a virtuous life. You will go to Hell."

For the first time, Mr. Smith's eyes flashed with emotion. "No! You must keep the balance. You must!" He began to weep.

The arbitrator shook her head. "I'm afraid not. Now depart. You have had your chance." 

The bailiff led the sobbing man away. The arbitrator felt confident in her choice. A life lived without purpose or care for morality was no life at all. Mr. Smith would have a long time to contemplate that fact. She called for the next case, ready as always to pass fair judgment on another soul.
