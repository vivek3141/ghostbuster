The old crone cackled as she peered into the crystal ball. "I see your fate, dearie. The prophecy foretells you shall die by your own hand."

My blood ran cold. Suicide? I would never do such a thing. I refused to accept that as my destiny.

I left the fortune teller's tent and wandered into the forest to clear my head. There must be a way to change my fate. I could not let that prophecy come to pass.

That night, I threw out everything that could be used to end a lifeâ€”no knives, ropes, or poisons remained. I would not give myself the means to fulfill that ominous prophecy. 

For months I lived carefully, avoiding risks and anything dangerous. My friends worried I had become paranoid. But I was simply being prudent. I would not let that fortune come true.

One day, I rescued a young girl being swept down the river. As thanks, her family gifted me a poultice they said could heal any wound. I accepted gratefully. 

That night, an intruder entered my home, attacking me with a dagger. Though injured, I escaped and used the poultice. Within minutes my wounds vanished as if never there. 

I realized with dawning horror I now had the means to end my life with no way of stopping myself. The prophecy would come to pass after all. There was only one solution. I had to disappear.

Under cover of darkness I slipped out of the village and entered the forest. I wandered for days until hunger and fatigue overtook me. Collapsing at the base of an ancient tree, I decided this was the place I would breathe my last. 

As my eyes slid shut, I heard a rustle of leaves and sensed a presence. The old crone from the fair stood before me, crystal ball in hand.

"You have done well defeating your fate, dearie," she said with a smile. "The prophecy was a trick, a test to see how far you would go. You have proved yourself wise and strong. Your fate is now your own to choose."

I laughed in disbelief and joy. The prophecy had been a falsehood after all. My future was unwritten, and my life was mine once again.
