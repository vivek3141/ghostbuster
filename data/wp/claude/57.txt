He stood there, looking at his own grave. The rain poured down, soaking into his suit as he gazed at the marble tombstone. His name - Jack Taylor - was carved into the stone, along with his birth and death dates. Only his death date was correct. 

Jack clutched the muddy parchment in his hand, the letter that had brought him to this lonely cemetery in the dead of night. The letter claimed that his wife and brother had conspired to have him declared legally dead in a sham trial so they could seize his fortune and estate. Outraged, he traveled in secret back to the town where he had lived for the past 20 years, a place he no longer recognized.

And now here he stood, staring at undeniable proof of their betrayal. They had wasted no time carving this monument to his supposed demise. Hot anger flashed through his body as the rain dripped down his face. 

The sound of a carriage approaching snapped him out of his trance.  He ducked behind a large oak tree, peering out to see who had come calling at this hour. The carriage came to a stop at the gate of the cemetery and two figures emerged -  a man and a woman. Moonlight flickered across their faces, and Jack stifled a gasp. It was his wife, Helen, and his brother, Edward.

Helen clutched a bouquet of roses in her hands as they walked toward Jack's false grave. His anger dissolved into sadness and longing at the sight of her. She looked pale and drawn, not like a woman enjoying newfound riches.

"I still can't believe he's gone," Helen said, her voice shaking with grief. She lay the roses at the base of the tombstone. 

"You must accept it, dear sister," Edward replied. "Though it may pain us, we must keep up appearances. The money from his estate will keep us comfortable for life." 

Jack clenched his fists in anger at his brother's callousness. So they mourned him for show while scheming to claim his fortune. He could stand by no longer.

Stepping out from behind the tree, Jack cleared his throat loudly. Helen gasped, clutching at her chest. Edward's face went white with shock. 

Jack glared at them, water dripping from his hat. "I am not so easy to get rid of, dear wife and brother. Now, I believe we have much to discuss."
