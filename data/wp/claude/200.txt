I woke with a yawn and stretched, slowly opening my eyes. At first, everything seemed normal in my bedroom. Sunlight streamed through the windows, the sounds of birds chirping filtered in from outside.  

Then I noticed the number floating over my head - a glowing blue 1.

"What the...?" I muttered, rubbing my eyes. But the number remained, shimmering and flickering as I moved.

A trick of the light? Some strange visual hallucination? I waved my hand through the space where the number hung but felt nothing. It stayed firmly in place.

My heart began to race. What was going on? I scrambled out of bed and went to the mirror, where I could see the 1 reflected along with my startled expression. This couldn't be real. Yet there it was.

I stumbled out of my room, hoping for some rational explanation, or at least to find I wasn't alone in this bizarre experience. "Mom? Dad?" I called as I hurried down the stairs. 
 
They were seated at the kitchen table, staring at each other in stunned silence. My mother had the number 2 over her head. My father, the number 3.

"Do you see...?" I asked faintly, pointing at the glowing numbers. They nodded, faces drawn with confusion and fear.

We turned on the TV and radio, flipping through channels. Every news report, every media outlet, was focused on the same bizarre phenomenon: everyone in the world had woken up to find a number visible over their head, floating 1 to 7 inches above them. The numbers seemed random, the same number often appearing over multiple people across countries, genders, ages and races.  

Scientists were at a loss to explain the sudden appearance of the numbers. Conspiracy theories were already spreading. Religious leaders proclaimed it a sign from God, though what message the numbers were meant to convey, no one could say.

In the following days, the world descended into chaos. Once placid neighborhoods became filled with suspicion and fear of the unknown. Everyone was on edge, worried what the numbers might signify and how they could be used to categorize or divide people. 

Governments struggled to maintain control and order. Makeshift camps formed, people banding together based on their shared numbers as a way to find solidarity. But clashes also erupted over access to resources, out of a belief that certain numbers deserved priority.   

Amid the turmoil, I stayed home with my family, venturing out only for necessities. We were unsure how to interpret our numbers but knew safety might lie in sticking together, as we always had before numbers came to define us. The future seemed uncertain, humanity's fate resting on whether we could look past the numbers suddenly stamped upon us all and remember the bonds of common humanity that had always united us. Our shared hopes, dreams, suffering and mortalityâ€”those endured far longer than any ephemeral label. 

Perhaps in time, the meaning behind the numbers would become clear and society would rebuild from the ashes. I could only hope we would emerge stronger and wiser, humbled by the reminder of how fragile our divisions truly were, and how swiftly the familiar could become strange when viewed through a new lens. The numbers had torn us apart, but maybe they could also bring us back together, if we let them.
