The Signal 

Jenny was tired after a long day at work. As she walked down the empty street to her apartment, she dug in her purse for her keys. The only light came from the dim streetlights overhead, casting everything in an eerie yellow glow.

As she walked, she passed by an alleyway and noticed a shadowy figure standing still, watching her. She felt a chill go down her spine and walked a bit quicker, keys now in her hand. 

When she got to her building door, she paused under the bright light and glanced back at the alleyway. But there was no one there. Yet she couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched. She shook her head, blaming it on an overactive imagination, and went inside.

Safely in her apartment, Jenny forgot all about the figure in the alley. As she made herself dinner, she flipped on the TV for some background noise. An old black and white movie was playing.  She didn’t pay much attention as she ate at the coffee table and scrolled through her phone.

On the movie, there was a pivotal scene where the main character, to prove his allegiance, gave a secret signal. He tilted his hat, clicked his heel, and scratched the back of his right hand twice. Just then, Jenny felt an intense itch on the back of her own right hand. Without thinking, she reached over and scratched it twice.

Outside her window, hidden in the shadows, a figure stood on the fire escape, watching and waiting. His organisation had been trying to recruit Jenny for months to gain access to her work computer system. But they needed to be sure she could be trusted before making direct contact. 

When the figure saw Jenny absentmindedly scratch the back of her hand twice, he smiled. It was the sign they had been waiting for, the sign only a loyal and dedicated member would know to give. His organisation's long recruitment process had paid off. The plan could now proceed to the next stage. 

Jenny would be contacted soon with her first set of instructions. Though she remained completely unaware, she had just become an agent for a secret organisation seeking to infiltrate the highest levels of power and make a lasting impact. Because of one small, random act—two little scratches—Jenny's life was about to change forever. She had unwittingly given the signal.
