The tiny speck of light grew larger as the Mars One lander descended to the surface. After seven months of travel, the crew of four had finally made it. They were the first humans to set foot on Mars. 

As Annika stepped off the ladder onto the dusty ground, she gasped. Despite seeing countless photos of the Martian surface, nothing compared to experiencing it in person. The rust-colored landscape stretched as far as the eye could see, harsh yet beautiful.

Once the initial thrill faded, curiosity set in. The crew began exploring their landing site, walking in short hops across the low-gravity terrain. 

While surveying a crater about a kilometer from the lander, Mark noticed an opening in the rock face. “There’s a cave up ahead,” he reported over the radio. They approached the entrance, flashlights flickering in the dim sunlight filtering through dust high in the atmosphere.

The cave was not deep, extending only about 10 meters into the rock. But what they discovered inside made them catch their breath.

There, against the back wall of the cave, was a human skeleton.

For a long moment, nobody spoke. It should have been impossible. They were the first people on Mars...weren’t they?

Annika stepped forward to examine the remains, her scientific training overcoming her shock. “Judging by the preservation, I’d say this person died within the last 50-100 years,” she said. That raised even more questions.

Mark aimed his light at the cave wall. Scratched into the rock were four words: “Gods save the king.” 

A shiver went down Annika’s spine that had nothing to do with her environment suit temperature controls. “There was no Mars colony established that long ago,” she said. “No mission ever landed astronauts and then covered it up.”

They all stared at the impossibility before them. Finally, Vijay voiced what they were all thinking: “If this person didn’t come with a space agency...how did they get here?”

They had come to Mars in search of answers about life’s potential in the universe. Instead, they were left with a mystery that would change everything they thought they knew. The red planet held secrets none of them had imagined. Their historic mission was now a race against time to uncover the truth behind the lone inhabitant of Mars.
