The old Victorian house sat atop the hill, shrouded in mystery and rumor. Jake sighed, another haunting, another day. He floated up to the attic and peered down at the bedroom below. A young woman sat on the bed, brushing her hair. 

Perfect, Jake thought. A lovely target for his spooks and scares. He started with a chill in the air and a flicker of the lights. The woman didn't react. Odd.

Jake rattled a few chains for good measure. Still, the woman went on brushing her hair, unperturbed. Jake scratched his ghostly head. Usually, his victims were shivering with fright by now.  

He floated down into the bedroom, ready to give this woman a proper haunting to remember. But as he materialized before her, the woman just looked up, rolled her eyes, and said, “Let me guess, another haunting?”

Jake was stunned. "You...you can see me?” 

“Of course I can. I’ve been able to see ghosts since I was a little girl. I’m Clara.”

“But...but I'm here to haunt you!" Jake protested. 

Clara sighed. "I figured as much. Look, no offense, but I've been haunted by so many spirits over the years, I just can't bring myself to be frightened anymore. I'm afraid you won't get much of a scream out of me."

Jake frowned, his ghostly ego bruised. His haunting prowess had never failed him before. But he had to admit, this Clara was not an easy target. In fact, Jake found her candor and lack of fear oddly refreshing. 

"Well, my haunting plans are ruined," Jake said. "But I must say, it's rather nice talking to someone who can actually see me for a change!"

Clara smiled. "Care to stay for tea?" 

Jake chuckled. "I'd be delighted!" He sat down on the bed next to Clara, finally finding in death the company he'd so long missed in life.
