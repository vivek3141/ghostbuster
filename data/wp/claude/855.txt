The Strange Tank 

John awoke with a start. He was submerged in a tank of pink, viscous liquid. He thrashed around in a panic, trying to determine which way was up. He finally surfaced, gasping for air, the pink fluid streaming down his face. 

Where was he? The last thing he remembered was going to bed in his apartment. Now he was in a dimly lit, metallic room, the only furnishings the tank he was in. His heart raced as the implications flooded his mind. He had been kidnapped.

“Hello?” he called out tentatively. No response. He called out louder, pounding on the glass tank. Still nothing.

His mind turned to escaping. He felt around the rim of the circular tank, looking for any latch or opening mechanism. None were apparent. The glass felt extremely thick and durable. Breaking through it did not seem possible without tools.

Exhausted, he turned his focus to the strange liquid. It was slightly viscous but not overly thick. It had a faint antiseptic smell. He dipped his hand in and out, examining it. It seemed harmless. But why was he placed in here?

Time passed, marked only by the rhythmic pumping of the oxygenation system keeping the liquid moving. Hunger set in. Panic started to rise again in John's chest. Would he be trapped here until he starved?

After what seemed an eternity, a panel opened in the ceiling and a figure peered down through the hole. Relief flooded John's body. "Thank God! Please, get me out of here!"

The figure said nothing. It observed him for a few minutes, expressionless, then closed the panel again, leaving John alone once more with nothing but the gently swirling pink fluid and the fear of what was to come.
