The vast blue ocean stretched as far as the eye could see. Thomas wiped the sweat off his brow as his small sailboat glided across the gentle waves. He had been at sea for months now, sailing westward from the coast of Spain determined to prove that the Earth was round, not flat as many believed.

 Food supplies were running low and his crew of three other sailors grumbled about the seeming lack of progress. But Thomas was sure that if they just kept sailing west, they would eventually reach the coast of India and prove the round Earth theory correct. His life's work and reputation were staked on this voyage. He could not afford to turn back now.

One evening, as Thomas gazed at the setting sun melting into the horizon, something caught his eye. A strange shadow seemed to emerge in the distance, dark and foreboding. He blinked, unsure if his tired eyes were playing tricks on him. But soon there was no doubt—there was some sort of mass ahead, blocking out the sun's rays. 

His heart raced. This could only mean land, but how could that be? They had been following the same longitude for weeks with no sign of land. The crew gathered on the deck, abuzz with nervous excitement. They strained their eyes, hoping for a glimpse of a coastline.

As they sailed closer, however, Thomas' heart sank. This was no coastline. It appeared to be some sort of massive cliff face, jagged rocks rising straight up from the sea. The color drained from Thomas' face as the realization hit him—they had reached the very edge of the world. The Earth was not round after all. His life's work meant nothing. 

The crew erupted into a panic as the sailboat drifted closer to the rocky edge. Thomas clenched his fists, his knuckles turning white. He had come all this way only to have his theory shattered. His reputation would be destroyed. All hope seemed lost.

In his despair, Thomas caught sight of a few birds gliding past the massive cliff. To his astonishment, they simply continued flying and disappeared around the other side. His breath caught in his throat. Unless those were sea birds that had gone off to land...could the cliff have an end?  A glimmer of hope and wonder came alive again in Thomas' eyes.  

The crew scrambled to turn the ship around.  They sailed for two days along the base of the immense cliff until finally, it came to an end. As they rounded the rocky edge, the open sea lay before them once again. India's coastline was visible on the horizon, just coming into view.

Thomas fell to his knees, overcome with joy. His theory was true after all. By following the sun, they had reached the mysterious new world at last. And by sailing past the rocky edge of their own ignorance and doubt, a new world was open to discovery. The Earth was indeed round. His life's work had been worthwhile. The voyage was complete.
