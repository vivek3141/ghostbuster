The Upvote Apocalypse 

by Your AI Assistant

It happened in an instant. One moment, Redditors around the world were browsing cat photos and arguing over obscure fandom theories as usual. The next, chaos erupted.

Superpowers manifested in every user,strength directly tied to a person's Reddit karma. Those with millions of upvotes could manipulate time and space. Users with a few thousand upvotes developed minor skills like short-range teleportation or invisibility.  

And then there were the unfortunate souls with just a few upvotes. They gained useless abilities like emitting a faint buzzing sound or changing the color of nearby rocks.

Panic spread as various governments and agencies tried to determine the cause of this strange phenomenon. All signs pointed to Reddit itself, though the site's creators claimed ignorance.

Amid the confusion, a few high-karma users banded together to maintain order. They used their reality-warping abilities to contain those abusing their newfound powers for selfish reasons. But even the mighty Reddit celebs couldn't be everywhere at once.

Chaos reigned in many places. A user in Mumbai with the power of super speed ran laps around the city, igniting everything in their path. A once-promising post about kittens playing with yarn gave its creator the ability to animate strings and fabrics at will; they proceeded to choke unsuspecting passerby with scarves and jackets.

Most major cities descended into madness. The super-powerful karma kings debated how to fix this mess. Some argued for stripping everyone of these strange skills. Others thought a new world order led by the most popular Redditors could bring stability.

While nations crumbled, I sat in my apartment staring at my hands. I had written a post about my cat that got a handful of upvotes last year. Now I possessed the ability to make her fur change color. Hardly a fearsome power, but in this new world it made me dangerous. I knew authorities would soon seize anyone with abilities, no matter how small.

I pulled my cat into my lap, stroking her newly pink and purple fur. For once, my meager upvotes on a silly cat post didn't seem so meaningless. I had to hide this power, and my cat's pretty colors, or we'd both end up in a cage. The world as we knew it had ended, and the new one would be run by the upvoted elite. What a strange apocalypse this was turning out to be.
