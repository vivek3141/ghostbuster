The thick forest stretched as far as the eye could see, a sea of green under the vast dome of the sky. Somewhere high above, beyond the clouds, the sun shone brightly, its light filtering through into the woods below. 

Jaya moved quietly between the trees, her worn leather boots making little sound on the loamy forest floor. In her hands she carried a crude spear, its tip sharpened to a point. She was hunting for dinner, hoping to find a small creature for a stew.

As Jaya walked, her mind wandered. Her people had lived in this great forest for as long as anyone could remember, traveling its length and breadth, living off its bounty. None remembered how or why their ancestors had come to this place. They only knew what had been passed down through the generations: that long ago, their people had come from somewhere else, traveling for lifetimes inside a great ship among the stars until at last they found this new home.

In her 19 years of life, Jaya had never known anything but the forest. Its massive trees rose high into the sky, blotting out any view of the outer world. The forest was all there was, supporting the several tribes that made it their home. 

Her reverie was interrupted by a strange noise in the distance. A loud groaning, creaking sound, as though a tree were falling. But it didnâ€™t stop. The sound continued, growing louder and deeper.

Jaya froze in place, listening. This was something new. In her experience of the forest, she had never heard anything like this. Her heart began to race.

Then, abruptly, the sound ceased. An eerie silence fell over the forest. The birds had stopped singing, and even the usual rustling of small creatures in the underbrush was quiet. It seemed the whole forest was holding its breath.

A few moments later Jaya noticed a glow filtering through the dense forest canopy. She looked up to see a bright light moving high above, casting an strange shadow across the ground. 

Jaya gasped. Her eyes widened in terror and amazement. There, up among the treetops, was an enormous object slowly moving over the forest. It was some kind of colossal, metallic thing, unlike anything she had seen before.

Her mind raced with panic. What could this be? Was it some beast come down from the sky, as in the old tales? Or something else entirely?

The massive object came to a stop directly overhead, its metallic surface reflecting the sun dazzlingly. Jaya cowered on the forest floor, her spear held out before her as though it could fend off this terrifying apparition.

Then without warning, a booming voice spoke. The sound seemed to come from all around, echoing through the woods.

"Attention, passengers. This is the intership announcer speaking. We have reached our final destination. Welcome home."
