Jake sat at the dimly lit bar, nursing an Old Fashioned. His eyes scanned the room, taking in the stylish d√©cor and well-dressed patrons. His gaze settled on a cute brunette chatting with friends at the other end of the bar. She laughed at something one of them said, her brown eyes crinkling.

On impulse, Jake discretely enabled the GPS intersection scan on his eyewear interface. A notification appeared: "7 intersection points found with subject in last 10 meters."

Jake frowned, surprised at the number. The scan aggregated location data from GPS-enabled devices to determine if and how often two people's paths may have crossed over time. Seven intersections seemed improbably high. 

He opened the details. The first encounter was dated to his 8th birthday, when he broke his arm falling out of a tree in his backyard. The emergency responders who came to help included someone whose GPS device was within 50 feet of his own for several hours that day.

The next intersection was on the day of his college acceptance. Another was during his breakup with his long-term girlfriend and the two accidently found themselves in the same coffee shop on a trip to get away from the memories. She was there as he walked through campus on the day he was expelled from university, his dreams shattered. Four more intersections, each corresponding to painful moments.

Jake stared at the brunette in disbelief. How was it possible she just happened to be in close proximity during his worst moments, his biggest disasters, by pure chance? An unsettling feeling grew in his stomach as his heart raced. 

She glanced over, meeting his gaze with a smile. His breath caught. In that moment, he knew with certainty she was somehow involved in orchestrating those disastrous events. But how? And why? 

He stood abruptly, nearly knocking over his drink in the process. He had to get out of there. As he hastily exited the bar, he could feel her eyes following him, burning into his back. He started running as soon as he hit the sidewalk, sprinting away as fast as he could from whatever sinister agenda had brought them together again.

After putting some distance between them, Jake finally stopped to catch his breath. His mind was reeling as he tried to make sense of the impossible revelation. He didn't know who she was or why she seemed hell-bent on destroying his life, one misfortune at a time. All he knew for sure is that he couldn't let her get close enough again to cause any more harm. He had escaped by the skin of his teeth, but the battle was far from over. The worst, he feared, was yet to come.
