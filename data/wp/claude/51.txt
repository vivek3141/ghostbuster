I woke with a start. Something felt different, like a new sense had awakened in me. I slowly opened my eyes and saw objects in my room trembling slightly. The floorboards under my bed vibrated and my glass of water had little ripples moving across the surface.

I realized with a shock that I could feel the vibrations of everything around me. I concentrated on the glass of water and willed the water to rise up and swirl in a little vortex. To my amazement, the water spun into a mini whirlpool!

I leapt out of bed, suddenly wide awake. I could control water! I had the power of hydrokinesis. This was impossible and yet here I was, manipulating the water with just my thoughts.

What else could I do? I focused on increasing the speed of the whirlpool and it spun faster and faster. I imagined shaping the water into a sphere and it morphed into a perfect watery orb. I telekinetically moved the orb around the room, bouncing it off the walls like a ball.

This was the most incredible thing that had ever happened to me. And with this power, I could do so much good.

I decided to start small by going into town and secretly using my new gift to help in little ways. I went to the park and used my hydrokinetic abilities to gently water flowerbeds and lawns that looked dry. I visited a pet shelter and changed and refilled the water in all the animals' bowls with just a thought. 

As I was walking down the sidewalk, I sensed a disturbance at a nearby bank. I peered in the window and saw two armed men threatening the customers and tellers. Without thinking I sprang into action.

I focused on the water molecules in the air and pulled them together into a dense fog, filling the entire bank with a thick mist. Under the cover of the fog, the hostages and staff were able to escape unnoticed. By the time the fog had lifted, the robbers realized they had been duped and the building was empty. The police arrived moments later and arrested them.

My good deed had been a success but using my power so dramatically was risky. I would have to be judicious about how and when I used this unique gift. 

Going forward, I helped out anonymously with my hydrokinesis whenever I could by secretly watering drought-ridden areas, emptying burst pipes in unattended buildings and even putting out a few small fires here and there. I got creative with how I applied this power and helped improve many lives in my town though no one knew of my clandestine assistance.

With great power comes great responsibility, and I was determined to use this wondrous gift to help as many people as I could without drawing attention to myself. I was just an ordinary guy with an extraordinary elemental talent, using water as a force for good. My new hydrokinetic life had just begun.
