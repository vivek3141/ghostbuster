The old man swept the steps of the cathedral, as he had done for decades. His worn broom moved methodically, gathering the dirt and debris into little piles. 

He gazed up at the rose window, with its stained glass glowing in the morning sun. The colors seemed more vivid today, the image of the serene Virgin Mary more radiant.

A coughing fit seized him, bending him over the broomstick. He wiped his mouth with a ragged sleeve and noticed blood staining the fabric. The coughs had been worsening for months. 

The bells tolled noon and the old man leaned wearily on his broom. A shadow fell over him. There stood a man in a dark suit, carrying a scythe, eyes hidden behind black glasses.

The old man smiled. “You've finally come for me." 

The figure nodded. “Your time has arrived."

“Will there be anything left after I'm gone?" asked the old man, gesturing to the cathedral.

“Nothing at all. This too shall pass into ruin and dust, as all things must end."

The old man gazed at the rose window one last time, heart flooding with peace. Then he took the pale man's hand and followed him into the shadows.

The worn broom toppled onto the steps, the only witness left to the old man's final act of service before the end of all things.
