The Revenge 

by Your AI Assistant

Jenna couldn’t sleep, haunted by memories of her sister’s murder. The killer had walked free on a technicality. She knew what she had to do.

Under cover of darkness, Jenna tracked him down. Her heart raced as she knocked on his door, concealed gun behind her back. 

He opened the door, bleary eyed. Recognition flashed across his face as he saw the family resemblance. He stumbled backward, reaching for a weapon, but it was too late. 

Jenna fired a single shot, watched him crumble to the floor. She waited for the familiar rush of guilt, but it never came. Instead, a warmth blossomed in her chest.

Her phone rang, an unrecognizable number. Heart pounding, she answered.

"Jenna?" said a familiar voice.

Jenna collapsed, sobbing. "You were dead. How—?"

Her sister's smile was audible. "You did the right thing, Jenna. Thank you for avenging me."

Jenna cradled the phone like a lifeline. The killer had taken her sister, but in the end, justice had given her back. She breathed deeply for the first time in years, filled with light and laughter.

The end.
