March 15th, 1943 
We arrived at the frontlines today. After months of training, we have finally joined the war. I have to admit, I'm scared. The sounds of artillery in the distance and the uneasy quiet in between blasts are unnerving. I've spent weeks preparing for this, but now that I'm here, it all feels different. More real. More dangerous.
 Our lieutenant gave us a pep talk before we got off the trucks. He told us to remember our training, watch each other's backs and fight like hell. I'm trying to stay focused on his words of advice,  but I can't shake the knot in my stomach. I wonder if the other guys feel as nervous as I do. We're supposed to assist an infantry unit that is pushing into a village a few miles up the road. I've never seen real action before. I hope I can be brave when the time comes. If this is my last journal entry, I want you to know that I love you all. I will do my best to make it home once this is all over.

Everything hurts. My body aches from exhaustion, my eyes sting from smoke and tears, and my heart is broken. I've seen and done terrible things. I watched Charlie get hit by a sniper yesterday. We tried to save him, but he bled out before the medics arrived. He talked about his little girl the whole time. Asked me to tell her he loved her. I don't know if I can face his family after this. 
The village was taken, but at a heavy cost. The Germans fought like demons to try and hold it. Now it's just a smoldering pile of rubble. I used to dream of glory and adventure, but there is no glory here. Just death and loss and pain.
I want to go home. I'm not a soldier, I'm just a frightened boy holding a rifle. But the war marches on, and all I can do is march with it. We are moving out to a new position tonight. I don't know if I have the strength to keep going, but it's not like I have a choice. I will fight because that is the only way this ends. And even if it ends me, I will continue on. For Charlie. For all the Charlies. I love you all. Please pray this ends soon.
