The old radio crackled to life in the bunker. "This is SurvivorType broadcasting on emergency frequency 121.5 megahertz. I have locked myself in an underground military bunker with enough supplies to last for years. But I have no way out." 

Jake leaned forward, intrigued by the mysterious transmission. He spun the dial on his ham radio to tune in.

"I was a biologist before the apocalypse," the voice continued. "Now I spend my days reading old books and trying to stay sane. I don't know if there's anyone left out there, but if you can hear this, you should know you're not alone."

A survivor, Jake thought. He had given up hope of finding others. His heart raced as he pressed the transmit button. 

"This is Jake, calling SurvivorType. I read you loud and clear. Please come in."

Silence. Then a crackle. "Jake! It's good to hear another voice. Tell me, what's it like out there? Have the zombies receded?" 

Jake smiled. "The coast is clear. But I could use some company. Want to get out of that bunker?"

A hearty laugh. "Do I ever! Guide me to your location. The apocalypse just got a little brighter!"

Jake grinned. His quest for human contact was over. And his new friend had quite a story to tell. The end.
