The Origin of Quantum Man  

Mark Stevens was a physicist working on quantum entanglement experiments in his garage laboratory. He had always been fascinated by the strange world of quantum mechanics and wanted to push the boundaries of human knowledge. After many long nights of tedious work, Mark had finally built a functioning quantum entanglement generator.

One night, Mark was running an experiment to entangle the quantum states of two hydrogen atoms. As the generator started up, there was a power surge causing a massive electromagnetic pulse to blast through the lab. The pulse struck the entanglement generator, overloading its systems. There was a blinding flash of light and Mark blacked out.

Mark awoke feeling strange. His body seemed to vibrate with mysterious energy. As he looked around the trashed lab, he realized he could see individual hydrogen atoms flying through the air. His vision had become microscopic and macroscopic at the same time. He flexed his hands and was startled to see quantum probability waves undulating from his fingertips. He realized with shock that the electromagnetic pulse had entangled his quantum state with the generator, giving him the ability to manipulate quantum energy with a thought.  

Over the following days, Mark discovered he could tunnel through solid objects by collapsing his quantum wave function, walk between raindrops by vibrating at light speed, and even reverse local time by manipulating relativistic frames of reference. The entanglement with the quantum realm had given him control over physics itself.  

With this immense power, Mark at first thought only of the academic possibilities. But after witnessing a violent armed robbery, he realized he had a moral duty to help people in need.  He designed a suit to focus his quantum abilities and adopted the alter ego of "Quantum Man".  

One night, Quantum Man was alerted by police scanner of a hostage situation at a local bank. A group of thieves had taken over the bank, trapping dozens of people inside. Quantum Man arrived at the bank in an instant. He phased through the wall to survey the situation. The thieves were armed with assault rifles, guarded the hostages closely.

Quantum Man began by using microscopic vision to analyze the atomic structures of the guns and dissolve their firing pins into quantum fuzz, disabling the weapons. As the thieves scrambled in confusion, Quantum Man vibrated into light speed, moving invisibly to knock them unconscious with precise nerve strikes before they could react.

In less than a second, all the thieves were disarmed and unconscious. The hostages were rescued without injury. The people hailed their new quantum hero.  

And so began the adventures of Quantum Man, defender of humanity. The ordinary physicist Mark Stevens had gained an extraordinary gift and with great power came great responsibility. He vowed to use his ability over reality itself to serve and protect the public to the best of his abilities. Crime would learn to be very wary of this guardian of justice who could bend the laws of physics to his will. The age of wonders had begun.
