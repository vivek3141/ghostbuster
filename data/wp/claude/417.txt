Jenny came of age today. Like all humans on their 18th birthday, she gained the ability to cast a single magic spell. The incantation was always a verb, unique to each person, that allowed them to enact some form of change on the world.

She woke up with the word resonating in her mind: "Grow." An open-ended ability, she thought. She could make plants blossom, speed up crops, or enlarge any living thing. The possibilities were vast. 

Her family gathered for her traditional birthday brunch. Her parents were eager to see what ability she had gained. Magic was still a mysterious force, and the spells that manifested in people were always a surprise. 

Jenny's mind raced as she helped set the table and poured juice. Should she start small, with a flower from the garden? Or go big, enlarging the ancient oak tree in their yard? She didn't want to waste it on something trivial. This was a once-in-a-lifetime gift.

As her family sang "Happy Birthday," Jenny realized she had made her choice. When she blew out the candles, she whispered "Grow" while picturing what she wanted in her mind.

A gasp arose from her family. The single candle she had blown out remained lit. Then two candles. Then three and four, until 18 candles were burning bright, creating a warm glow over the celebratory table. 

Jenny smiled. "I wanted to do something meaningful, that we could share together. This felt right."

Her parents beamed with joy and pride. "This is a perfect gift, my darling. Light to brighten each new year of your life. You have used your ability wisely."

Her younger brother laughed. "Now I'll have to come up with something even more impressive when I turn 18!" 

Jenny gazed at the flickering candles, feeling blessed in the warmth and light of her loving family. The ability to "Grow" was a gift she would cherish - and use judiciously - for the rest of her days. She made a silent wish that this light and love would continue to grow in her life and the lives of her family for all the years to come.
