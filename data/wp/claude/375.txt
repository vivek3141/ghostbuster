The Choice 

The day had arrived. After years of debate and preparation, it was time for every person on the planet to choose their superpower. But there was a catch—the more people selected a particular power, the weaker it would become for everyone.

Jenny had been agonizing over the choice for months. She wanted something unique but also useful. She didn't want to end up with something lame like the ability to glow in the dark if thousands of others chose it too.

As Jenny browse the seemingly endless list of options, a few caught her eye:

•Mind reading: Useful but if too many choose it, it might end up just picking up loud broadcasts. Pass.

•Invisibility: Very tempting but no doubt would be one of the most popular, rendering it useless. Next. 

•Elemental control: Summoning fire, water or wind could be interesting but probably too flashy for her tastes. Keep looking.

•Accelerated probability: The ability to make unlikely things more likely to happen intrigued her. But hard to know how strong it would end up if others chose it. Too uncertain.

Then she saw it: "Flash foresight"—The ability to see 24 hours into the future for 3 seconds. Enough to be useful but subtle enough that hopefully not many others would choose it. She submitted her choice just as the deadline hit.

Over the following days, news reports started analyzing what people had chosen. Invisibility, mind reading, and elemental powers were indeed the most popular, rendering them rather useless. But a few unusual powers remained elusive. 

One morning, as Jenny woke up, she suddenly saw flashes of what was to come in the day ahead. She grinned, realizing her "flash foresight" was intact and would be her secret advantage. Her patience and desire for the subtle had paid off. While everyone else would be rather powerless or just performing parlor tricks, she knew she would put her ability to good use. Carefully and selectively, of course. But what an edge it would give her each and every day.
