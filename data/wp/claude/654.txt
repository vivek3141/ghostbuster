The city gleamed below me as I stood atop the Tip Top Tower, cape billowing in the wind. The police scanner crackled as I waited for the inevitable call for help. I wasn't any average caped crusader. I was The Persuader, the world's most successful superhero. 

Unbeknownst to everyone, I didn't actually have any powers. I couldn't fly or shoot lasers from my eyes or anything spectacular like that. But I did have a gift - I was able to craft villain-breaking speeches. A few carefully chosen words was all it took for me to convince even the most hardened criminal to turn themselves in.

The scanner sparked to life, alerting me to a hostage situation at the central bank. I fired my grappling hook and swung down, crashing through the skylight for a dramatic entrance. 

"Freeze, evildoers!" I bellowed.

The robbers spun around, guns trained on me. The ringleader, a burly man with a large scar down his cheek, snarled. "You again! Get out of here or I start shooting hostages!"

I strode forward confidently, staring into the eyes of each robber as I began to speak.

"My friends, why do you do this? You are clearly intelligent and capable men. Yet here you are, resorting to violence and theft to solve your problems. You are better than this. Each of you still has good within you, I can sense it."

A few robbers looked down, avoiding my gaze. But the leader was unmoved. "Nice speech, but we're here for the cash. Now back off!"  

I focused my full attention on him. "What happened to you to make you believe this is your only path? There is always redemption, a chance to change your life for the better. You just have to be brave enough to make the right choice."

For a long moment, the room was silent. Then, trembling, the leader lowered his gun. The other robbers followed suit. By the time the police rushed in, the would-be thieves had already surrendered. My work here was done. I fired my grappling hook and swung up into the dawn, victorious once again. The Penetrator's work was never done, after all.
