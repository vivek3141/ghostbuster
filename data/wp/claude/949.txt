The old diner hadn't changed in the two decades since they first met there as kids. The red vinyl booths, the squeaky swivel stools at the counter, the neon "open" sign that flickered on and off, it was all exactly the same. 

Jenny slid into her usual booth and smiled as her best friend Carla walked in. No matter how much time passed, seeing Carla always felt like coming home. They had been inseparable since the third grade, bonded over their shared love of books and imagination. Though from very different worlds, their friendship had endured everything life had thrown at them so far.

Carla slid in across from Jenny. "The usual?" she asked, picking up the grease-stained menu out of habit more than need. 

"You know it," said Jenny. "Two chocolate shakes and a basket of fries. And I'm buying this time."

Carla opened her mouth to protest but Jenny cut her off. "Don't argue. You can get the next one." 

Carla smiled, relaxing into the familiar back-and-forth of their friendship. "Fine, but next one's on me." She took a sip of water. "So, fill me in. How's life in the outrageously wealthy world?"

Jenny sighed. "You know I hate talking about all that. Honestly, the money has felt more isolating than anything recently. My parents are doing another extravagant Europe trip and want me to join but I just can't summon the energy. I wish we could just do normal things every once in a while, like seeing a movie or making dinner at home. I feel like I hardly see them anymore with their constant trips and events."

"I'm sorry to hear that," said Carla gently. She knew how hard it was for Jenny growing up with parents who lavished her with everything except their time and presence. "You're always welcome to join for a family dinner over at my place. Mom would love to have you."

"Thanks, I may just take you up on that," said Jenny. Their milkshakes arrived and they slurped in tandem.

"So what's new for you?" asked Jenny. "How's the new house?" Carla's family had recently moved into a small but cozy house, a huge step up from the rundown apartment they had shared for years.  

Carla smiled, joy lighting up her eyes. "It's wonderful. I mean, the water heater is still iffy and the porch leaks a bit, but it's ours. Mom and I were talking about how for the first time in forever, things feel steady. Like we can finally settle in and stop worrying about money and just enjoy having our own space. I feel so grateful." Her smile faded a bit. "I know it's not much compared to what you're used to but for us, it's perfect."

"Don't be silly," said Jenny, squeezing Carla's hand across the table. "That's amazing news. I'm so happy for you and your mom. You deserve every good thing." In a world of excess and overabundance, Carla was always able to appreciate life's small details in a way Jenny admired endlessly. Despite all they had and hadn't in life, when together nothing else mattered but the irreplaceable gift of their friendship.
