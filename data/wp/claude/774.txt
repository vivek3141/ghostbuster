The Darkness Closes In

The blackness was all around me. Thick and suffocating, devoid of any light. I couldn't see my own hands in front of my face. 

My heart started pounding as panic rose in my chest. I spun around, desperately searching for any pinprick of light, some landmark or exit in the sea of black. But there was nothing. Only the inky void.

The walls were closing in around me. Even though I couldn't see them, I could feel them getting tighter, the space constricting. A trapped, claustrophobic feeling washed over me. I gasped for air as my lungs tightened. There was no escape. I was sealed in this lightless tomb.

I started running, stumbling in the darkness. My hands grasped at empty air. I ricocheted off unseen walls, the corridors narrowing with every step.  My breath came in ragged gasps now as terror flooded my veins. The darkness was going to swallow me whole.

And then I heard it. A faint skittering sound, just on the edge of perception. I froze in my tracks, listening. There it was again, a clicking, scratching noise. I was not alone.

The hairs on the back of my neck rose. My heart threatened to pound out of my chest. What was in here with me? What nightmarish creature lurked just out of sight, watching me with unseen eyes, waiting to strike?

I screamed then, a primal shriek of horror. I screamed until my throat was raw, begged for help at the top of my lungs. But no salvation came. There was no escape from this hell, no awakening from this nightmare. The darkness pressed in, filled my mouth, my nose, my eyes. And as the blackness consumed me utterly, I heard one final skitter in the shadows. The creature had found me at last.
