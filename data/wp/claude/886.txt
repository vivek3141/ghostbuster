The pencil scratched across the page as John's hand flew in a frenzy of lines and curves. His desk was covered in discarded drawings, a piled mess of defeats and failures. But still he drew on. 

John was once the most feared superhero on the planet. With a single thought he could level cities, turn day into night, or scatter his enemies to the far corners of the earth. His powers were nearly limitless. But absolute power corrupted absolutely. In a fit of rage years ago, he had wiped out an entire country, millions of lives extinguished in an instant. The shock of what he had done had crippled his mind, sealing away his powers in a place he could no longer reach.

Now John was just a man in a small room, drawing madly in a vain attempt to recapture a glimmer of the forces that once surged at his command. His remaining solace was translating the crackling energy he had once wielded into the frenetic movements of his pencil, purging his inner demons line by line. 

The pictures were a window into a shattered but brilliant mind. Beams of light bending at impossible angles, whirlwinds of fire and shadow, fractal patterns folding into infinityâ€”his drawings were a map of all that was wondrous and terrible in the universe. John knew that as long as he still had a pencil and paper, he would go on translating power into pictures, containing on a page what he dared not hold in his mind. His hands would not stop until there were no more surfaces to fill, no more metaphors left to render in lead and wood pulp. And on that day, he feared what might remain trapped inside with nowhere left to go.
