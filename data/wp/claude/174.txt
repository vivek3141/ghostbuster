The Love Letter in the Closet 

I was exhausted after a long day of classes at the university. As I walked down the dimly lit hallway to my dorm room, I noticed a small white envelope on the floor in front of my door. A love letter? My heart skipped a beat. I picked it up and saw my name scribbled on the front in delicate handwriting. 

I went into my room, threw my bag on the floor and sat on my bed, curious yet apprehensive about what the letter might contain. Did I have a secret admirer? I opened the envelope carefully and unfolded the letter.

Dearest [Your Name],

I have watched you from afar and have developed strong feelings for you over the last few months. I think about you constantly and know in my heart that we would be perfect for each other. I would love the chance to take you on a date to get to know you better. If you feel the same way, leave a note under your door tomorrow evening and I will reveal myself to you. 

Yours truly, 
A friend

My heart swelled as I read the sweet and romantic words. Then, uncertainty set in. A friend? But I had no idea who could have sent this. I read through the short letter several times, searching for any clues about the identity of my admirer. There were none to be found. 

I didn't get much sleep that night, my mind racing and imagining all the possibilities. A boy from my English lit class? The cute girl I always passed on my way to the science building? By the next morning, I had worked myself into a state, nervous but eager to find out who had feelings for me.

When evening came, I sat down to write a short response to the letter as requested, letting my secret admirer know that I was open to getting to know them better. I slipped the note under my door and waited. 

A few minutes later, I heard a knock at my closet door. My closet door? I opened it to find my good friend and roommate Mike standing there, a huge grin on his face. 

"Surprise!" he exclaimed. "Did I get you?"

I shook my head as the realization hit me. "You wrote the letter, didn't you?"

"I wanted to cheer you up and thought a little prank might do the trick," he replied. 

I gave him a playful shove. "Don't mess with me like that!" But I couldn't help but laugh. I had to admit, his trick had worked. My mood was lifted at the amusing thought of Mike composing a love letter to me. I'd have to get him back for this sometime, but for now, I was just grateful for a friend who knew exactly how to make me smile.
