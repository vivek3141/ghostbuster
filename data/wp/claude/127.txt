I scrubbed in for the procedure, going through the routine preparations. It was a simple appendectomy on a young, otherwise healthy man. Routine and low risk. As I entered the operating room, my confidence faded for just a moment. There, standing ready in scrubs and gloves, was Death himself. 

His skeletal figure towered over the operating table, his hollow eyes glancing at me as I entered. I froze in place, my heart pounding. None of the nurses or anesthesiologists seemed to notice his presence. I felt a chill down my spine as his empty gaze studied me.

I had read old folklore about surgeons encountering Death in the operating room, omens that a patient's life was in peril. But I dismissed these as fanciful legends. Now faced with the grim reality, I questioned if the patient would make it off the table alive.

My fears were irrational, I told myself. This was a simple, standardized procedure. I took a deep breath and approached the table, avoiding eye contact with Death. The nurses began prepping the patient, who was now under anesthesia. I tried to focus on the routine, to steady my shaking hands. 
 
As I cut into the patient's abdomen, Death drifted around the table, a silent observer monitoring each movement. When I identified the swollen, inflamed appendix, Death peered over my shoulder, his face inches from mine. I shuddered at his hollow breath on my cheek, the smell of decay and mortality.

Removing the appendix was simple enough. I sutured carefully, wary of Death's critical evaluation. Each stitch felt ominous, as if holding together not just the patient's flesh but the fragile veil between life and death. I worked methodically but as fast as possible, eager to escape Death's presence.  

At last I closed the final incision, bandaged the patient, and breathed a sigh of relief. The procedure was complete, all vital signs stable. As the nurses prepared to move the patient to recovery, I finally dared to look up. The room was empty. No towering, menacing figure. Just a typical operating theater, everything as it should be. 

I peeled off my gloves, discarded the bloodied scrubs. My hands were still trembling. I had laughed off the old stories of surgeons and omens, but now I could still feel Death's hollow gaze on my back as I left the room. His appearance was a reminder that each surgery held unpredictable dangers, and life itself hangs by a delicate thread which I hold, however briefly, in my all too human hands.
