I can't believe I made it. As I floated down to the surface in my damaged landing capsule, I didn't think there was any chance of survival. Yet here I am, standing on the dusty gray surface of the moon. 

When the escape rockets on my main craft malfunctioned, sending me hurtling off course, I thought for sure death was imminent. The surface sped up to meet me at a terrifying pace. I closed my eyes and braced for the inevitable.

The impact was deafening. For a few moments, all I could hear was the blood rushing in my ears. But slowly, my senses returned. I opened my eyes. Through the spiderweb of cracks in my visor, I saw the familiar craters of the lunar surface. I moved my arms, my legs, wiggled my fingers. Everything still worked. I had survived.

Training took over as I went through the motions of checking critical systems. Life support intact. Communications system damaged but functioning. I sent out a distress call to mission control. They responded right away, both relieved and concerned. Help is coming, they assured me, in the form of a rescue craft. But it will take time.

Now alone in this harsh and isolated place, I have nothing but my thoughts and the slow beat of my heart to keep me company. It's in this solitude that the fragility of my existence comes rushing into focus. Out of the billions of people on our small world, I alone find myself stranded here, the first woman to walk on the moon reduced to a speck suspended in the inky black void. 

I don't know what the future holds, whether I will make it home to feel the warmth of the sun again or breathe fresh air and see green leaves. But should my final resting place be here, an eternal wanderer on this alien world, I find solace knowing I have borne witness to sights and sounds no other human ever has. For one fleeting, perilous moment, I touched the moon. And it touched me back.
