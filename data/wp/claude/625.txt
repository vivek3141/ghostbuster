The notifications on my phone began a few months ago. At first, it was a trickleâ€”a couple college classmates and a guy I met at a bar. Then, they started picking up frequency as more and more names started appearing multiple times a day. They were people I interacted with on social media or briefly met once or twice. A few I recognized from my gym. A couple were complete strangers
In a twisted way, it was validating to know how in-demand I was in the dreams and desires of so many. But it also made me feel objectified and creeped out. I restricted my profiles, limited public photos, and avoided posting anything too revealing but the notifications kept coming faster and faster each day.  
I don't know how it's possible that these people are alerting my phone with this disturbing information. I've tried changing my number and deleting all my accounts but it continues without fail. There seems no escape from this invasion of my privacy and unwanted connection into these intimate moments of strangers that I never asked for and desperately want to end. But the notifications just keep coming, and coming, and coming. There's no way to make it stop. My phone has become a constant reminder of how out of control everything feels. How so many see me as something I'm not. And how alone I am in wanting the silence back.
