The old leather journal sat on the attic floor, covered in dust and cobwebs. Beth spotted it as she was sorting through boxes of her late grandfather's belongings. She had never known him to keep a journal - he was a stoic, taciturn man. 

Her curiosity got the better of her and she opened the journal. The first entry was from 65 years ago, a few months after her grandmother had passed away. In her grandfather's shaky handwriting was a confession she never expected: 

"I have kept this from Elizabeth for our entire marriage. I feel the time has come to unburden my soul, though I know not how.  Emily was not just a friend, she was my first true love. We were passionately in love as teenagers, and when she discovered she was with child, I did the honorable thing and married her. The baby was lost, our first, but by then duty bound us together. 

Over the years my affection for Elizabeth grew, but Emily always possessed my heart. We stole moments when we could, but not nearly enough. The short time I had with Emily before her passing were the only times I felt truly alive. 

Elizabeth deserves the truth, but I cannot break her spirit now. My secret will have to remain guarded, and die with me. I only hope I can be reunited at last with my darling Emily in the next life. She has my heart, she always will."

Beth gasped, tears springing to her eyes. Her devoted grandmother, gone all these years, had deserved so much more from the man she adored. Beth now understood her grandfather's distance and frequent melancholy moods. She wished she could go back in time and tell her grandmother the truth, that she was deeply and eternally loved. Her grandfather's secret was a burden Beth now wished he had never kept, if only to spare her grandmother years of quiet heartbreak, always longing for the love she deserved.

Beth wiped her eyes, gently tied up the journal and placed it back in the attic. Some secrets were best left undisturbed. Her grandmother's memory deserved peace. Beth said a prayer to the two souls now reunited, hoping they had finally found happiness together.
