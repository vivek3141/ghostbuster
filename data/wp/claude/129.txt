I unlocked the front door of my small suburban house, juggling my laptop bag, a bag of groceries, and the mail as I walked in. “Honey, I'm home!” I called out as I usually did. No response. My wife must have still been at the gym for her evening workout class.  

I made my way to the kitchen and froze in my tracks. There, occupying almost the entire space, was a sleek black grand piano. I blinked, confused. Had I walked into the wrong house? No, this was definitely my kitchen—there was the dent in the wall by the pantry I'd been meaning to patch, and the spice rack I'd installed last year. But how on earth did a grand piano get in here?

I set down my things and inspected the instrument. It seemed high quality and well-maintained. The fallboard was open, inviting me to play. I pressed a key and the tone rang out, clear and resonant. This was no cheap upright. Someone had gone to a lot of trouble to get this piano in here. 

My mind raced with possibilities. Had my parents bought this as a surprise gift? No, they knew a piano wouldn't fit in our small house. Had a secret admirer delivered this to impress me? That only happened in cheesy romance movies. This had to be a practical joke of some kind. But who would do such an elaborate prank? And how did they even get the piano inside without a team of movers?

Just then I heard keys in the front door. My wife walked in, dropped her gym bag, and headed into the kitchen. “I'm home!” she called. Then she gasped. I walked over to her, baffled.  

She looked at me, equally confused, then started laughing. “Did you do this?” she asked. I shook my head. She frowned. “Then who...?”

We both turned as we heard a loud bump behind us. To our shock, the piano started moving across the floor towards the kitchen doorway, playing itself as it rolled. As the last notes of “Chopsticks” echoed down the hall, the front door clicked shut. We stared at each other in disbelief. This was going to be a strange night.
