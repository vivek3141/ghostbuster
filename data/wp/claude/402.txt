Jenny walked into the diner and saw her old friend Sally sitting in their usual booth, two cups of coffee already on the table.  Sally looked up with a smile. 

"Jenny! You made it. Just like old times, huh?"

Jenny slid into the seat across from Sally. "Yeah, just like old times."

How long had it been? Five years? Ten? However long it had been, in that moment it felt like no time had passed at all.

They had spent so many hours in that booth, talking about everything under the sun over plates of greasy diner food. Back when life's biggest problems were boys that didn't call and papers that hadn't been started yet. Before real life kicked in. 

"So, catch me up!" Sally said. "What have you been up to?" 

Jenny took a sip of the coffee. Still bitter, just like she remembered. "Well, I'm teaching English at the high school now. I got married, had a couple kids."

Sally's eyes went wide. "You're a mom? I can't believe it. You were always so focused on your career. And marriedâ€”what's your husband like?"

Jenny smiled, thinking of Mark. "He's great. Kind, funny. I got really lucky." 

Sally grinned. "Look at us. Who'd have thought we'd actually grow up, huh?" 

"Speak for yourself," Jenny teased. They both laughed.

They spent hours talking, filling in the gaps of the years apart, reminiscing about old times. The world outside passed by unnoticed as they caught up on all they had missed in each other's lives.  

Too soon the light faded outside the windows and the diner owner flipped the sign to "Closed." 

They walked out into the cool evening, hugging tightly under the neon glow of the diner sign.

"Don't leave it so long next time," Sally said. 

"I won't. Just like old times, huh?"

Sally smiled. "Yeah. Just like old times."
