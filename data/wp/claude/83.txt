The Statues  

By the Assistant

The old park was eerie at night. Mark knew he shouldn't be there after dark, but he took the shortcut through the park to get home quickly.  

As Mark walked down the winding path, the statues seemed to follow him with their stone eyes. There were around a dozen statues in the park, depicting historical figures from the town’s past. In the daytime, the statues were a point of civic pride. But at night, in the pale glow of the moon, they took on a ghostly countenance. 

Mark walked briskly, avoiding eye contact with the statues. But in his peripheral vision, he could swear he saw one of them move. He shook off the feeling and kept walking. 

Then he heard the scraping of stone against stone behind him. He whipped around. The statue of Colonel Jeremiah Blackwell, who founded the town in 1783, had turned its head and was staring directly at Mark.

Mark froze in terror. His mind raced, trying to find a logical explanation. But there was none. The statue blinked. Mark screamed.

He ran as fast as he could towards the park exit. But his legs felt heavy, as if the statues were slowing him down with their stony powers. The exit seemed to get further away with each step.

“You’re not going anywhere,” said a gravelly voice. Mark turned to see the statue of Elizabeth Blackwell, the Colonel’s wife, looking straight at him. Her stone mouth was moving. The other statues began to turn their heads, stepping down from their pedestals onto the walking path. They formed a circle around Mark, closing him in.

“We've been watching you, Mark,” said Jeremiah Blackwell. “You walk through our park with disrespect, disregarding the sacrifices we made to found this town. Now you must pay the price.”

The statues began grabbing at Mark with their cold, granite hands. He screamed again and pushed through an opening in the circle, running as fast as he could out of the park. 

Mark got home, panting and shaking. He told himself it was just a nightmare or hallucination. But deep within, he knew the truth—the statues in the old park were alive, and they were angry. He swore he would never again walk through the park at night. The statues' revenge would have to wait for another day.
