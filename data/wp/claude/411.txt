The alien invasion of Earth had begun. Massive bloodred ships descended from the sky, slowing and landing soundlessly as if by magic. But when the ships opened and the aliens emerged, it was not with high tech laser weapons or cloaking devices. Instead, they rode beasts that were clearly alien yet reminiscent of Earth horses, and they wielded blades like sabers. 

Jenna watched in stunned disbelief from her family's farmhouse as an entire legion of the aliens thundered across the field, riding their beasts toward the nearby town. She grabbed her young son and held him close, not sure of what to do. Her husband was in the fields and hadn't returned. She said a silent prayer that he had found shelter.

Within minutes, the sounds of screams and the acrid smell of smoke drifted from the town. The aliens ransacked buildings, tossing furniture and litter onto the streets. A few brave souls emerged from the town hall with weapons to fire on the invaders, but their bullets seemed to ricochet off the aliens without harm. The invaders didn't even slow their rampage.

In the distance, Jenna spotted a lone alien rider detaching from the group and galloping in their direction. She shoved her son under the bed. "Stay here. Do not come out. No matter what happens." She grabbed the shotgun they kept for vermin and ran to the front door, her hands trembling.

The alien and its beast approached at full speed, a streak of red and black. At the last moment, the beast reared up, neighing fiercely. The alien's eyes glowed molten gold under the visor of its helmet. It pointed the saber at Jenna.

She didn't hesitate. Firing both barrels of the shotgun, she braced for the kickback. The alien was knocked from its mount, which galloped off in a panic. But the alien rose, snarling, its body seemingly unharmed. It strode toward her, raising its saber to strike.

Jenna swung the shotgun like a club, smashing it into the alien's torso. It was like hitting solid metal. The alien batted the gun away and grabbed her by the throat, lifting her off the ground. Up close, she saw its pale blue skin, the muscles rippling with power under its armor.

With its free hand, the alien unsheathed a dagger and placed the blade against her cheek. Hot blood trickled down. Jenna closed her eyes, her son's face flashing before her.

Then the alien grunted, dropping Jenna abruptly. She crumpled to the ground, gasping for air, her cheek stinging. The alien had turned away, distracted. It took a few steps from her, then collapsed, a dagger protruding from the back of its neck where there was a small exposed area of flesh.

Jenna's husband stood behind, clutching another dagger. He ran to her and helped her up, embracing her wordlessly. She sobbed into his chest, shaking with relief and shock.

The aliens could be killed. They had found their weakness. The tide of this invasion could still turn.
But for now, the smoke rose black in the distance, and the red ships waited ominously in the sky. The real battle was just beginning.
