The old crypt was damp and musty, filled with the scent of decay. Jill clutched her jacket close as she descended the worn stone steps, her heart pounding. She didn't know why she agreed to this silly dare from her friends, sneaking into the abandoned crypt in the middle of the night. 

At the bottom of the steps, Jill peered into the gloom. The only light came from the flickering lanterns they brought, casting an eerie glow over the dusty coffins and urns. Her friends giggled nervously, spreading out to explore the crypt. 

Jill walked slowly up to one of the coffins, wiping away thick cobwebs. The brass plate was tarnished, but she could make out a name and date: Lord Percy, 1754-1823. She shuddered. Over 150 years, and still encased in this rotting box.

A scraping noise echoed from the shadows. "Did you hear that?" she whispered. Her friends laughed at her fear. "Probably just rats. Don't be such a scaredy cat."

Jill's lantern flickered as she walked further into the crypt. In an alcove, a large stone sarcophagus came into view, its lid slightly askew. More scraping noises came from within.

Her curiosity overcame her fear. Jill slid the heavy lid to one side, peering in. 

A gnarled, bony hand shot out, grasping her wrist with unnatural strength. Jill screamed as a corpse pulled itself up from the sarcophagus, blindly grasping at the edge with rotting fingers, jaw slack, desiccated skin clinging to its skull. 

Her friends came running as Jill struggled in the creature's grip. Their lanterns illuminated the alcove, flashing over the animate corpse. It released Jill with an unearthly shriek, crumbling back into its resting place. 

Heart pounding, Jill scrambled out of the crypt with her friends. They slammed the door, trembling. The sign posted outside now held new meaning: "Visitors are reminded that flash photography is not permitted, as it may disturb the corpses."
