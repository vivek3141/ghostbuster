The bracelets came as a shock to everyone. Thin metal bands with intricate circuitry that glowed when you came into proximity with whatever would ultimately end your life. Most people's bracelets glowed intermittentlyâ€”a soft pulse when a reckless driver sped by, a brighter flash when a illness crept through the neighborhood. A constant, ominous glow meant something more imminent.  

My bracelet had never glowed. Not once in the three years since the bracelets had appeared. At first, I was paranoid, constantly on alert for any sign of a glow. But after months of nothing, the anxiety faded into indifference. I began to think my bracelet was defective.

That theory was shattered the day the stranger walked into the coffee shop. I was in line to order my usual when the door opened and a young woman strode in, confidence radiating despite her plain appearance. But my eyes were drawn to her bracelet, glowing brightly through the long sleeve of her shirt. She noticed my gaze and tilted her head, beads of sweat forming on her brow as she took in my bracelet. The lack of glow seemed to startle her as much as hers had startled me. 

She walked up to me, eyes flicking between our bracelets. "Yours never glows?" she asked, a slight tremble in her voice. I shook my head. Her bracelet pulsed even brighter, matching the rhythm of her quickening heartbeat I could see through her skin. 

"Never. Not once," I replied. She let out a shaky laugh, raking a hand through her hair. 

"What do you think it means?" Her tone was almost pleading, as if desperately hoping I had an answer that would negate the ominous implication of her glowing bracelet. I could only offer a sympathetic shrug.

Her name was Eva. Over cups of coffee, she told me about the eerie glow that had begun three months ago and never faded. Her doctor could find no medical reason; she was the picture of health. The implications were disturbing but abstract until this moment, faced with concrete evidence of her bracelet's warning in the form of my inert one. The added variable threw everything into question.

We met several more times, Eva eager to spend time in the calming aura of my bracelet's inactivity. I tried to give her that respite, even as her constant glow unsettled me. It had become erratic, pulsing and flaring in a way that seemed to mirror her increasingly fraying emotions. 

One rainy afternoon, Eva told me the glow had reached a blinding level even in daylight. Her voice was hollow. "I don't know what to do. There's no way to stop what's coming when I don't even know what it is."

I squeezed her hand, wishing I could absorb some of the fear weighing her down. "We'll figure this out. I'm not going to let anything happen to you." She smiled sadly, running a thumb over my still bracelet. 

A week later, Eva called me in a panic. The glow had turned into a searing, all-consuming blaze. I raced over to find her cowering in the corner of her dark room, blinded by the light spilling from under her sleeve. At the sight of me, the glow began to fade, the first time that had happened in months. Eva peered up at me with equal parts confusion and hope.

"It's you," she whispered. "You're what this has been warning me about all along."

My blood ran cold as the implication hit me. But looking into Eva's worn yet luminous eyes, I found not a trace of fear or danger. Only peace, a quiet joy at an end found. Or perhaps a beginning, glowing steadily under the cover of her sleeve, waiting patiently for the end of its timing and the start of its reign.
