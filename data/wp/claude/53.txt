The old logs crackled in the fireplace, the flames licking at the soot-covered bricks. John sat in his worn leather armchair, staring into the fire. The warmth was comforting on this cold winter night. 

After a few hours, John started to doze off, the fire flickering in the periphery of his vision. His eyes closed for a moment. When he opened them again, the fire seemed to have grown bigger, the logs fully engulfed in flames. He must have been asleep longer than he thought.

John added a few more logs to the fire before heading up to bed. The fire continued to roar as he climbed the stairs. 

The next morning, John was awoken by a strange warmth. He opened his eyes—the fire was still burning bright, the new logs reduced to ashes. His heart racing, John ran downstairs. The fire showed no signs of dying down, the flames reaching higher and higher.

John threw open the windows to let the frigid air in. He grabbed a fire extinguisher and emptied it onto the flames, but they only grew in size and ferocity. Dropping the empty extinguisher, John could feel the heat on his face from across the room. 

Panic rose in his chest as the realization hit him. The fire doesn’t go out anymore. It only spreads and destroys. 

John ran out of the house as the flames engulfed the walls of the living room, escaping just as the roof caught fire. He watched in horror as the flames consumed his home, leaving nothing behind but ashes and the memories of a life now in ruin. The fire that doesn't go out had left its mark.
