The Copy Experiment 

Dr. Ava Simmons had spent her career researching cloning and genetic duplication. Her latest experiment was an attempt to copy a human, but introduce slight mutations in each copy to study how small changes might affect personality and behavior.

She started with a single cell from a volunteer, Tom, and was able to successfully copy it into two identical embryos. As the embryos developed into infants, Ava noted some small differences. Baby Tom 1 was quiet and placid, while Baby Tom 2 was fussier and more active. 

As the boys grew into children, their differences became more apparent. Tom 1 was studious and introverted, preferring to read and build models alone. Tom 2 was rambunctious and needed constant stimulation from others. Their intelligence seemed equal, but their personalities were quite distinct.

Ava replicated the experiment, this time producing 10 copies of Tom with varying mutations. The results were startling. While all 10 boys shared some core characteristics with the original Tom, such as curiosity and humor, their personalities ranged from brooding to bubbly, passive to persistent, carefree to compulsive. 

Nurture also played a role. Tom 2 and Tom 7 were raised in a more enriching environment and showed the most advanced cognitive and social skills. Tom 9 experienced early neglect and struggled with behavioral issues, despite his inherent brightness.

Ava's experiment was a breakthrough in demonstrating how small genetic differences, interacting with environment, shaped a person's identity and destiny. The 10 Toms, while genetically almost identical at the start of their lives, grew into very different people as a result of the biological lottery and life's experiences. Through her pioneering work, Ava proved that cloning did not necessarily mean creating carbon copies or robbing people of their humanity. Even small mutations, she showed, led to big outcomes. Our diversity, even at a genetic level, is what makes us human.
