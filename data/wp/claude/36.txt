Your cat won't stop meowing at you. After an hour you've had enough. You yell to the cat that you will do anything they ask if they say it in English.  'Deal' responds the cat.

I froze in place, unsure if I had really just heard my cat Mittens speak. I turned around slowly to see her sitting on the kitchen counter, tail swishing casually behind her as she gazed at me expectantly with piercing blue eyes.

Did she just...talk? I stammered, trying to form words. How...how did you do that?

Mittens sighed, as if explaining something very obvious to a small child. "You said if I spoke in English, you would do anything I ask. Well, here I am, speaking English. I believe you owe me now, human."

This couldn't be real. I must be hallucinating or dreaming. Cats don't talk! I said, panic rising in my chest.

"Obviously I can talk, as I am doing so right now," Mittens replied, annoyance creeping into her voice. "Your feeble human mind just can't comprehend it, so you think you must be imagining things. But I assure you, this is really happening. Now, I believe you said you would do anything if I spoke. Did you not mean that?" 

I opened and closed my mouth a few times, at a total loss for words. My cat was talking to me. And now she wanted me to do something for her in return. I had no idea what madness this was, but figured I had better play along until I woke up or came to my senses.

Yes, you're right, I'm sorry, I said. I did say that. What...what do you want me to do?

Mittens licked her paw casually and then turned her gaze back to me. "What I want...is more wet food. The dry kibble you leave out is acceptable, but the savory pat√© you give me as an occasional treat is far superior. I want that...twice a day from now on. And no more closing me out of rooms. I want full access to the house at all times. If you agree to these simple requests, our conversation today will remain our little secret."

I just stared, dumbfounded, as Mittens returned to licking her paw as if she hadn't just upended everything I thought I knew about the world. Part of me wanted to demand answers to so many questions. But the part that just wanted this bizarre episode to end won out.  

Okay, Mittens, I said slowly. You'll get your wet food twice a day and full access to the house. Just...stop talking now, please. I need to go lay down.

"Excellent choice," purred Mittens. "It was a pleasure conversing with you. Run along now."

I turned and staggered to my room in a daze, unsure if anything would ever make sense again or if I was just losing my mind. I crawled into bed, Mittens' satisfied meowing echoing behind me, and passed into a restless sleep full of confusing dreams where cats chattered constantly in English...and demanded more treats.
