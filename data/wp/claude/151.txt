The heavy steel door slammed shut behind me with a loud clang that echoed down the barren corridor. I gulped, clutching the insulated pizza bag in my sweating hands. The orderly who had let me in was busy locking and bolting the series of doors, paying me no mind.

I had never been inside a mental institution before, let alone a maximum security ward. The hair on my arms stood on end. Everything was harsh, clinical white. There were no windows or decorations, just a long hallway lined by heavy metal doors with small windows and slots at the bottom.

As the orderly finished securing the entrance, I cleared my throat. “Um, excuse me. Where should I deliver this pizza?” 

He turned around slowly. His expression remained blank. “Nice try. Get back to your room.”

I blinked in confusion. “No, you don’t understand. I’m delivering a pizza. For a patient named...” I glanced at the receipt, “John Doe, Room 108.”

The orderly began advancing towards me, his pace measured and purposeful. “I said, get back to your room.” 

My heart jumped into my throat as panic rose. “No, really, there’s been a mistake. I’m just a delivery guy!” I held up the insulated pizza bag like a shield. 

The orderly didn’t stop. In a flash, his strong hands grabbed my shoulders and began forcibly shoving me down the hallway. I cried out in protest, my sneakers squeaking against the polished floor as I struggled in vain. The steel doors with their small windows flashed by as I was pushed further into the bowels of the lockdown ward. 

“Please! I'm not supposed to be in here! I need to deliver this pizza!” I pleaded breathlessly as we passed Room 101, 102. His grip was iron. I continued to struggle but I was no match for his brute strength.

Just as we passed Room 108, a booming voice echoed from inside. "Where's my damn pizza!?" The orderly froze. A face appeared behind the small window, glaring out at us. "You said 20 minutes! I want my pizza now or there'll be hell to pay!"

The orderly's face went pale. His hold on me slackened as understanding dawned on his features. I met his eyes, nodded slowly, and held up the insulated pizza bag as confirmation. He swallowed hard. In a heartbeat I slipped from his grasp and rushed to the door of Room 108. 

With shaking hands I unlocked it and entered, my heart pounding as I came face to face with the occupant - a burly, bearded man covered in tattoos sitting on his cot. His angry expression turned quizzical as he spotted me. 

Outside the room, the orderly shouted “My apologies, sir. I didn’t realize he was the pizza delivery man.” 

The patient's eyes lit up at the prospect of food. "Well, don't just stand there! Gimme my pizza!” 

I exhaled in relief and took the pizza from its insulated bag. As I handed it over, the patient grinned, dropping a large handful of bills into my hand. "Keep the change."

I thanked him profusely. When I emerged, the orderly was waiting nervously. I nodded to indicate the delivery was done. 

"My apologies for the confusion," he said sincerely, looking embarrassed. He escorted me out without another word. I've never been more grateful to exit through those steel doors, back into the freedom beyond. After that brush with institutionalized life, I had to resist the urge to kiss the ground. I climbed into my car, threw the insulated bag onto the passenger seat with a sigh. All in a day's work - though some deliveries were more memorable than others. At least the tip was good.
