Mr. Donovan hobbled into the classroom, his weathered cane clacking on the wooden floor. He leaned onto his podium, peering at the class over his half-moon spectacles.

"The Battle of Hastings, 1066. Does anyone know the significance of this date?" His gravelly voice filled the room. 

Emma glanced at her friend Maya. They had both suspected for years that Mr. Donovan wasn't quite human. His thick white hair and beard seemed as old as time. She was sure her parents had stories of Mr. Donovan teaching their history class, just as he had taught her grandfather's generation.

A bony finger pointed at Emma. "The defeat of King Harold by William the Conqueror, establishing the Norman rule of England," she said mechanically.

Mr. Donovan nodded, lips curling into a subtle smile, punctuated by a dry cough. 

"Very good, Miss Lawrence. I see my lessons havenâ€™t been lost on you," he wheezed. His eyes seemed clouded with memories of times long past.  

Maya passed Emma a note under the desk: Do you think he's immortal???

Emma looked at the hunched figure at the front of the room and the decades of history etched into his face. She nodded gravely at Maya. There was something eternal about Mr. Donovan and the sepia-toned world he seemed to inhabit. She had a feeling he would still be here, recounting the tales of ancient wars, long after they had left these halls and aged into dust. Yes, she suspected Mr. Donovan would live forever.
