The picnic had been perfect. The sun was shining, the breeze was warm, and the meadow was beautiful. Emma smiled as she watched her children playing and laughing, chasing each other through the tall grass. Her husband Thomas unpacked the picnic basket, laying out their favorite foods on a gingham blanket.

"This was a great idea," Thomas said, wrapping an arm around her waist. Emma nodded, leaning into him. She closed her eyes, letting the memories of family picnics from her own childhood wash over her. The familiar sounds and smells filled her with contentment. 

After they had eaten their fill, Emma brought out the surprise - a kite for each of the children. Their delighted squeals made all the effort of preparing for this day worthwhile. For the next hour, they ran and jumped, coaching each other in getting the kites up higher and higher into the endless blue sky.

Emma began packing up the leftovers and blanket while Thomas helped the kids with their kites. "Time to go soon," she called. The children groaned in protest.

"Five more minutes, Mom, please!" her daughter begged. Emma relented, smiling at their obvious joy. She walked over to where Thomas stood with a kite, intending to take her turn.

Just then, a dark shadow passed over the sun. Emma looked up to see ominous storm clouds gathering, blocking out the light. The warm breeze turned cold and gusty. Her heart seized in her chest.

"Get the kites down, now!" she screamed. They scrambled to reel in the kites as the sky continued to darken. Heavy drops of rain began pelting the meadow. 

They gathered up their belongings in a panic, running to take shelter under a large oak tree. A menacing thunderstorm raged, lightning flashing and thunder crashing around them. The little bit of blue sky that remained slowly disappeared.

Huddled together under the inadequate shelter of the tree, cold, wet, and terrified, the perfect picnic had turned into a nightmare. Their fondest memories would now be tainted by the storm that had descended upon them so quickly, without warning, and shattered their summer day. The storm left as fast as it came, but its damage was done.
