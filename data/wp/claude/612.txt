The lights flickered but stayed on as I stared at the single upvote on my desperate Reddit post. “Is there anybody else out there?” I had asked weeks ago as a last ditch effort on r/askreddit, hoping for any sign of human contact after the virus wiped out the rest of humanity.  

At first, I thought the apocalypse might not be so bad. No more alarm clocks, no more traffic, no more bills to pay. I could do whatever I wanted without consequences. But the thrill of absolute freedom quickly faded. The empty streets filled with weeds, the internet remains filled with memories of a world now gone. I searched tirelessly for any clue that I wasn’t completely alone.

I checked every social network, every messaging app, hoping for any unseen notification or unread reply. Most accounts went inactive around the same time as the outbreak started except for the occasional automatically posted update. I left messages on random profiles, tried video chatting with long inactive accounts, scouted for any clues of human activity. But there was nothing. 

My Reddit post sat unnoticed for weeks until that single upvote appeared. Such a small thing, but in that moment it felt like a beacon of hope. My heart raced as I refreshed the page eagerly, waiting for a reply to appear. A hello, an introductions, anything to prove I wasn’t alone. But no reply came.

I tried to deduce who might have left the upvote. Was it an old friend who survived and still checked Reddit out of habit? A fellow survivor in another country where the infection hadn’t spread? Or just an automated upvote bot which hadn’t been turned off? No explanation made sense. None aligned with the utter silence everywhere else.

As the days passed without further activity or response, the thrill of hope faded once more into the aching emptiness of solitude. The upvote now seemed merely a cruel prank by the algorithms and code left running in this electronic ghost town. My AskReddit post and its false glimmer of contact were but echoes of humanity, as transient and meaningless as everything else in this world now inherited by nothingness.

In the end, there was no message in that single upvote. No deeper meaning or clue to latch onto. Like all things since the outbreak, it wasn’t meant to be analyzed or understood. I was alone, and in the vast sea of the internet as in the world outside, there simply wasn’t anyone else out there. All that remained was to let the flickering lights and servers run as long as they lasted in this data center mausoleum, holding fast to fading shreds of a now vaporized world. And when the machines finally sighed off, I would be left in the dark, silence echoing the truth that in this future without humans, I was the last analog signal crying out with no receiver left to answer.
