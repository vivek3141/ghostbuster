The call came in the dead of night. The slim phone rang  in the log cabin, disturbing the peace of the rustic retreat.

Jake sighed and opened his eyes. His enhanced senses told him this was not a normal call at 3AM. He answered calmly. "Bonjour?"  

The voice on the other end was panic-stricken. "Jake, it's Jim from Ottawa. Code Maple Leaf. Repeat. Code Maple Leaf."

Jake sprang to alertness. Maple Leaf protocol meant Canada was under attack and needed its last line of defense: The Eh Team. "Understood," Jake replied. "Activate the team."

He threw on his red uniform emblazoned with a maple leaf and peered out the window into the dense forest surrounding the cabin. His keen vision spotted two heat signatures swiftly moving through the trees – fellow Eh Team members responding to the call.

Within 10 minutes, they had rendezvoused at Jake's cabin. There was Mary, otherwise known as Poutine, with her uncanny ability to manipulate gravitational fields. And Claude, or "Toque," could generate intense heat and cold from his hands. Together with Jake's extraordinary senses and agility, they made up the formidable Eh Team. 

"What's the situation?" Jake asked Jim, who had set up HQ in the secret basement of the cabin years ago in preparation for just such an event.

"We have numerous unknown bogeys approaching Canadian airspace from the north and east," Jim reported. "They have advanced cloaking technology and move too fast for our air force to intercept."

"Looks like Santa's not the only one who sees us when we're sleeping," Toque deadpanned. 

"This is no time for jokes," Jake admonished. "How long do we have?" 

"Based on their speed, we estimate the bogeys will reach major population centers within two hours," Jim said grimly.

"Alright team, you know what to do," Jake commanded. "Gear up and move out!"

The Eh Team scrambled into their jet and took off, flying low to avoid radar detection. Mary focused and began levitating the jet to give them more speed. 

An hour later they approached the Yukon, spotting unusual shimmers in the night sky – the bogeys' cloaking devices. "There they are," said Jake. "On my mark...Now!"

Toque aimed a massive blast of ice at two bogeys, coating their hulls and disabling the cloaking devices. Poutine then launched a powerful gravity well, seizing control of the bogeys and crashing them into each other.  They exploded in mid-air.

"Bogeys downed," said Poutine. "But there's more where that came from."

"Then let's give them a proper Canadian welcome," said Jake, eyes glinting.

The Eh Team accelerated and launched into the night, ready to defend their homeland. Their unusual skills may be outside the norm, but for the Eh Team, it's all for love of Canada, eh.
