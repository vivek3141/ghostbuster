The Invisible Reaper

Death sighed. His curse was eternal vigilance. He could only perceive one human at a time, and he knew that whoever appeared before his senses, he must take their life. 

He sometimes wished for normal vision. He envied humans and their blissful unawareness of him. For Death could never restâ€”as soon as one soul left its body, another would appear to him, and he would be compelled to end them.

Today his view fell upon a young woman walking through a park. She was happy, smiling, with not a care in the world. Death steeled himself. He swept in silently, prepared his scythe, and with a quick slice severed her soul from her body. She fell lifeless to the ground.

Even after eons, Death never grew numb to the cries of anguish from loved ones who found the newly dead. But his role was fixed. He could only see and end one mortal at a time.

An old man appeared next, struggling for breath in a hospital bed. His time had come. Death dispatched him promptly.

And so it continued, as it always had and always would. A life extinguished here, another there. Slowly, steadily, Death worked, never resting.  

Until at last, for a few brief moments, no new vision arose to greet him.  During these rare gaps, Death wished again for release from this perennial obligation. But soon enough, another soul would appear, another life force gaining shape in front of senses that could frame only a single being. 

He steeled himself once more, gripped his blade, and got on with the grim work to which he was condemned. For Death could see only one at a time, and he knew that whoever appeared, he must kill.
