The Untold Story of Osama Bin Laden's Demise 

The world knows that Osama Bin Laden, the mastermind behind the 9/11 terrorist attacks, was killed on May 2, 2011, at his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan in a raid by U.S. Navy SEALs. What very few people know is the truth about how Bin Laden actually died—and it was not at the hands of the SEALs.

Aisha al-Tamimi was a 17-year-old girl whose family lived in a small village 100 miles from Abbottabad. Her father and older brother had joined Al Qaeda and revered Bin Laden. They were away for long stretches, leaving Aisha to care for her mother and three younger siblings. Aisha hated Bin Laden for taking her father and brother away and leaving them in poverty. 

One night, Aisha's father and brother returned home for the first time in months. They were accompanied by three other Al Qaeda members—and Osama Bin Laden himself. Bin Laden had traveled in secret to meet with Aisha's father to discuss a new terrorist plot. 

Aisha served Bin Laden dinner while seething with rage. Her younger siblings were frightened in his presence. As Bin Laden ate, he callously asked Aisha's father, "Why haven't you yet married off this young woman? We have too many unwed temptresses in our midst."

Aisha snapped. She took a knife from the counter and plunged it deep into Bin Laden's neck, severing his carotid artery. Blood spurted everywhere as Bin Laden gasped and clutched at his neck. 

Aisha's father and brotherwere stunned. The other Al Qaeda members pulled out their guns and aimed at Aisha. But her father yelled, "Don't shoot!" He could not bear to see harm come to his daughter. 

Bin Laden lay on the ground, life draining from him. "Don't just stand there—do something!" he ordered. But no one knew how to respond. By the time they thought to call a doctor, Osama Bin Laden was dead, felled at the hands of a 17-year-old girl avenging her family's ruin.

Aisha's father knew Bin Laden's followers would kill them all for this act. He told the others to report that Bin Laden had been killed in a U.S. raid. To protect his daughter, he smuggled her out of the village and faked her death.

Aisha finally found freedom, as Al Qaeda announced Bin Laden's 'martyrdom'  at the hands of the Navy SEALs. She smiled, knowing the truth about how the terrorist leader met his end alone, bleeding out on the floor of her family's tiny home in Pakistan.
