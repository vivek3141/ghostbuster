Jenny was a single mother struggling to make ends meet. She worked two jobs to provide for her young daughter, Emma. Jenny sacrificed everything to give Emma a good life. She gave up her own dreams and ambitions to ensure Emma had opportunities she never had. 

One day, Jenny's manager at the diner told her they had to cut her hours. Business was down and labor was the only place left to trim costs. Jenny panicked. She wouldn't be able to pay rent and buy groceries with her hours cut. She asked friends and family for loans but everyone was strapped themselves.

In desperation, Jenny decided to skip her shift at the department store to look for a higher-paying job. Emma stayed home alone for a couple hours each afternoon, so Jenny figured it would be fine. Emma was a responsible 10-year-old.  

 A few days later, Jenny's manager called and angrily fired her for missing shifts without notice. Now Jenny was out of a job and an income, with no leads on anything new. The rent was due in a week. 

Emma could sense the stress and fear in her mother. She wanted to help. Emma saw a woman in the neighborhood looking for a babysitter a few hours a week. Emma volunteered her mom for the job without asking Jenny first. Jenny was furious at Emma for overstepping, but she desperately needed the money.

Jenny started the babysitting job, rushing over each day after the diner and staying late into the evening. She barely saw Emma as a result. Emma grew resentful of the little boy Jenny now cared for. She started acting out in small ways to get her mom's attention again.

One afternoon, Emma was home alone and started looking through the drawers in Jenny's room. She found an old scrapbook with newspaper clippings of her mom's high school track victories. Emma never knew her mom was an accomplished athlete. She realized her mom gave up all her dreams to raise her alone.  

Emma's heart swelled with love and guilt. She decided she would apologize to her mom for being selfish and find a way to help out more. She wanted her mom to be happy again. Emma started doing chores without being asked and making dinner so it was ready when Jenny came home late.  

Jenny began to notice the change in Emma's behavior. Her heart warmed at Emma's thoughtfulness and maturity. She was so proud of the caring young woman Emma was becoming. Jenny knew that no matter what hardships came, the two of them would make it through together.
