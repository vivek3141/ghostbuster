The Rocket Ship 

Ever since I was a little boy, I dreamed of flying. Not just in an airplane, cruising at 30,000 feet. I dreamed of flying up into space, piloting my own rocket ship on thrilling adventures exploring the unknown. 

I was enthralled with the early days of space travel, devouring books about the Mercury and Apollo programs. While other kids had posters of sports stars on their walls, I had diagrams of spaceships and photos of astronauts. For every school project, I found a way to incorporate something about space travel. I built models of rockets, drew pictures of what I thought future space stations might look like, and even wrote stories imagining what it would be like to walk on Mars or travel to distant worlds.

My parents encouraged me, signing me up for space camp and taking me to see every new space and science fiction film. For my 10th birthday, they gave me a telescope so I could gaze up at the stars and planets, dreaming of where I might someday travel. I studied diagrams of constellations and memorized the names of galaxies light years away. 

One night, I peered through the eyepiece of my telescope, focusing in on the red planet Mars glowing brightly in the night sky. As I gazed at its rust-colored surface, imagining what secrets it might hold, I dreamed of the day I might pilot a rocket ship there. I could almost feel the rumble of the engines powering up and the g-forces pressing into my body during liftoff.   I pictured looking back at the Earth, a blue marble floating in the inky black void of space. The controls would be at my fingertips as I steered my craft on a mission to explore the unknown.

After months traveling through the silent darkness, I would ease my rocket down to the surface of Mars, kicking up red dust with my landing. I would emerge in my spacesuit, gazing up at the salmon-colored sky and two small moons in orbit. As I pressed the first human footprint into the soil and unfurled the flag of Earth, I would know I had fulfilled my childhood dream of becoming an astronaut pioneering the space frontier.   

Though my dream of personally traveling to space may never come to pass, I continue to find wonder gazing up at the stars. And in the faces of eager children at space camp, I see a new generation of dreamers and explorers, waiting to pilot humanity into the future. My childhood dream lives on.
