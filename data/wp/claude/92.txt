The old cabin stood alone in the forest, weathered and worn. As night fell, Jenny lit a small fire in the fireplace to chase away the darkness and the chill. Her grandmother sat in a rocking chair, knitting by the firelight.   

"Grandmother, tell me again why we had to leave our home," Jenny said. Her grandmother stopped rocking and looked up from her knitting.

"We had to leave because it was not safe there anymore, my dear. Your father made many enemies, and now they seek vengeance. As long as we stay hidden, we will be safe."

"How long must we hide?" Jenny asked. Her grandmother sighed and resumed her rocking. 

"I do not know, child. But even when it is safe for you to go out into the world again, you must never tell anyone where we went or where this cabin is. You must never come back here. Do you understand?"

Jenny nodded, tears stinging her eyes. Her grandmother put down her knitting, walked over and hugged her tightly.

"Do not cry, my little one. This is to keep you safe. After you leave here, remember that you must never look back. Never come back to this place. No matter what happens."

The next morning, Jenny packed her meager belongings and prepared to set off down the narrow path leading away from the cabin. Her grandmother handed her a cloak and a small bag of food for the journey. 

"Be safe, my darling. I love you," her grandmother said. Jenny hugged her one last time.

As Jenny walked down the path and the cabin disappeared behind the thick trees, she wiped a tear from her cheek. She would never see her grandmother again or return to the only home she had ever known. But to keep them both safe, after she left there, she knew she must never look back.
