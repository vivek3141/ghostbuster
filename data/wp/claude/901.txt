The old wizard sighed as his young apprentice ran into the tower, shouting about dragons outside.
"Master, there are a few dragons outside terrorizing the village!"

The wizard raised an eyebrow. " You know the difference between subjective and objective, right? 'Some rabbits' is the former, 'three rabbits' is the latter, and much more accurate. So I'm going to need you to be very clear when you say there are 'a few' dragons outside."

The apprentice took a deep breath. "Yes, master. My apologies. There are four adult red dragons and two juveniles circling the village, breathing fire and knocking over houses." 

"Much better. " The wizard grabbed his staff and descended the stone stairs. His apprentice followed.

They emerged to see six enormous dragons rampaging through the small village, setting fire to rooftops and sending the townspeople fleeing.
The wizard slammed his staff into the ground, uttering words of power under his breath. A ripple of energy surged outward, engulfing the dragons. They froze in place, trapped in the wizard's binding spell.

"You see?" Said the wizard. "Precision and objectivity are key. 'A few' dragons could have meant three - or it could have meant six. Now we know exactly what we are up against."

The apprentice nodded, committing the lesson to memory. Precision and objectivity. Key tools for any wizard.
