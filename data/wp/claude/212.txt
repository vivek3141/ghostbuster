The sun streamed through the cracks in the wooden wall of the small cottage. I blinked, confused by my surroundings. This was not my bedroom. Where was I? 

Panic started to set in as I took in the rough sheepskin blanket, the dirt floor, the sounds of chickens outside. This couldn't be real. Just a moment ago I was in my apartment, my comfortable modern apartment with electricity and plumbing and internet.

A dream. That's the only explanation. I had fallen asleep and was dreaming I was living in the Middle Ages. At any moment now I would wake up and be back home. I steadied my breathing, waiting to wake. Minutes passed. Nothing changed. 

Dread filled me as the realization hit - this was no dream. Somehow, impossibly, I had traveled back in time. My whole life up until now had been a dream, and now I was awake. Awake in the 14th century. 

A woman entered the cottage, stopping short when she saw I was awake. "You've risen at last! We feared you may never wake." She poured water from a pitcher into a bowl and brought it to me to wash. "Brother Thomas found you asleep under the old oak tree and brought you here to recover. You seemed stunned and confused, murmuring the strangest things."

I said nothing, just nodded and accepted the water. What could I possibly say? That I had traveled here from over 600 years in the future? They would think me mad. 

"I am Martha," the woman said gently. "Do not worry yourself, you are safe here. My husband and I will care for you until you are well enough to be on your way."

I smiled weakly at Martha, a wave of gratitude and affection for this stranger who showed me kindness when I had none washing over me. My old life was gone. I knew not how I came to be here, but here is where I found myself. I resolved in that moment to do as the Romans did - adapt to the conditions in which I found myself. My new life awaited. The Middle Ages awaited. I took a deep breath and stepped forward into the unknown.
