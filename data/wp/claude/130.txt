The nebula was a glowing sea of gas and dust in vibrant hues of red and orange. Massive clouds of hydrogen and helium swirled through the expanse, lit from within by the intense radiation of the young star at its center. 

Jenna guided her research ship into the outer edges of the nebula, being careful to avoid the densest pockets of dust that could damage the ship's engines. Her scanners mapped the composition of the clouds around her, searching for any signs that planet formation was underway.

As the ship plunged deeper into the nebula, Jenna's scanners lit up. "I'm picking up a gravitationally bound mass about 2,000 kilometers in diameter, composition indicates heavy elements. It looks like the beginnings of a planetesimal."  Her heart raced at the discovery. This was why she had comeâ€”to find planets in their earliest stages of development, to witness the forces of nature conspiring to create worlds.

She recorded readings and took high-resolution images of the planetesimal taking shape before her eyes under the influence of gravity. The dust and gas surrounding the sphere were being drawn in, accreting onto its surface. With time and more material, this tiny body could grow into a full-fledged planet. 

Jenna smiled at the thought that she might be among the first to gaze upon this new world, still hazy and indistinct in its celestial womb, but destined to one day support life under the glow of its star. She had found magic in the cosmos, unfolding endlessly before her. Her voyage into this nebula was a journey to the beginning, to the place where planets are born.
