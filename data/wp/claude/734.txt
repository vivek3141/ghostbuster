The twin suns of Persephone slowly rose over the rust-colored hills, bathing the valley in a soft orange glow. Jenna awoke in her pod and stretched, joints cracking after a decade of sleep. 

Through the pod's window she could see the familiar landscape of long-abandoned ruins poking through the morning mist. Once a thriving colony, now a graveyard of humanity's first interstellar attempt.

Her pod door hissed open and she climbed out, boots crunching on the rough soil. The stillness felt heavy, as if the ghosts of the dead were watching her in disapproval.

Jenna walked the overgrown path to the colony's old habitat unit. Inside, she powered up the ancient console, launching a decades-delayed message into the stars: "Colony ship Persephone, calling home. Mission failed, pathogen released. Do not attempt rescue. I am the sole survivor, staying to stand guard over this tomb world as penance for our hubris."

She stepped outside and gazed up at the twin suns ascending into the salmon-colored sky. Her solitary watch had begun. No one would disturb this world's rest. Persephone's story was over, its warning sent. Now there was only Jenna, the caretaker of ghosts in this place of quiet dreams and stone memories.
