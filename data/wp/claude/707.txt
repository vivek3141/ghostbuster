The bullets whizzed by Captain Jenna Marks as she raced across the open ground toward the enemy trenches. Even as a hail of gunfire erupted around her, she knew none of the rounds would find their mark. They couldn't kill her. Not anymore. 

After the invention of the Regenerative Cellular Therapy 20 years ago, humanity had conquered death. Injuries could be healed, aging could be reversed, and lives could be indefinitely extended. At first, it was thought this would usher in a new era of peace. Wars would become obsolete without the threat of death.

But humans found a way. The wars continued, now fought with non-lethal weapons that inflicted maximum pain. The goal was no longer to kill the enemy but rather to incapacitate them and claim victory. After all, if no one could die, wars could rage endlessly without resolution.

Jenna leapt into the enemy trench, firing her plasma rifle on stun setting. Two enemy soldiers crumpled to the ground, twitching in agony. But more were coming. Within seconds, a dozen weapons were trained on her.

A hail of plasma fire erupted, catching Jenna directly in the chest. Her body seized as the stun rounds delivered excruciating shocks through her system. She collapsed to the ground, her muscles refusing to respond. Yet through it all, her heart continued to beat steadily. She remained alive.

As Jenna lay paralyzed in the bottom of the trench, listening to the sounds of ongoing battle, she reflected on the irony of it all. Humans had gained immortality, but they had lost more than they gained. Without the fear of death to deter conflict, war had become perpetual. And without the escape of death, many lived on in anguish.

Eventually, the effects of the stun rounds wore off and Jenna regained control of her body. But the war continued. There would be no rest. After 200 years of fighting, victory remained as elusive as mortality. All that was left was an eternity of futile battle in a world without end.
