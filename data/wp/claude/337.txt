The winding mountain road was dark and slick with rain. I was driving too fast, eager to get home after a long day. Rounding a sharp turn, I suddenly saw headlights bearing down on me, swerving into my lane. 

Panic rose in my chest. There was no time to react. My hands gripped the steering wheel, knuckles white.

In a desperate prayer, I threw my hands up and shouted, "Jesus, take the wheel!"

Seconds passed in slow motion. I braced for the impact. But none came. 

Confused, I opened my eyes. The headlights were gone. The road ahead was clear. But I was still speeding along the mountain pass, hands raised, with no one controlling the wheel.

Shocked, I grabbed the wheel and slammed the brakes. The tires squealed as I pulled off the road, heart pounding. 

"What...how...?" I stammered, looking around the empty car. Everything seemed normal. Too normal. It didn't make sense. There was no way I could have avoided an accident. Not at that speed, on that road, with an oncoming car about to hit me head-on. 

A chill ran down my spine. What if my desperate prayer had been answered in a most unexpected way? But if Jesus took the wheel, where did he go? And how did he make the other car disappear?

The questions swirled in my mind on the slow drive home. I walked through the front door in a daze. The TV was on, and the news report made me stop in my tracks: "A serious car accident on Route 11...driver claims the oncoming car just vanished...police investigating the unusual circumstances..."

My mouth went dry. It couldn't be. I grabbed my phone and pulled up the location of the crash on a map. It was the exact spot where I had nearly crashed into another car. The exact spot where I had begged Jesus to take the wheel.

A strange sense of peace washed over me. I didn't understand how or why it happened. But in that moment of looming disaster, my panicked prayer had been mysteriously and miraculously answered. Jesus, or some higher power, had taken control and delivered me from a horrific crash that should have been unavoidable. And then, as quickly as he had stepped in, he had vanished into the night, leaving me with a glimpse of his saving grace and the knowledge I would never be alone behind the wheel again.
