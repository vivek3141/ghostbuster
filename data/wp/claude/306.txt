The old freighter rattled as it dropped out of warp speed, the hull groaning under the stresses of deceleration. Captain Jenna Marcks rubbed her temples, feeling the familiar headache that always accompanied warp travel. 

They had arrived at the Kiril system after a week of warp jumps, skirting the edge of Human space. As the freighter cruised towards Kiril III, Jenna gazed at the planet through the viewscreen. A temperate world of vast blue oceans and green continents, dotted with cities glowing under the night side of the planet.

Her comms officer turned to her. "Captain, we're being hailed by Kiril Port Authority. They've cleared us to land at Docking Bay 94."

Jenna nodded. "Take us in, Lieutenant Kamal."

The freighter slipped into the atmosphere, descending towards the sprawling spaceport. As they landed, Jenna saw various starships from other species in the neighboring docking bays. Elegant Kantian cruisers with their ring-shaped warp gates. Bulbous Maltiun ships riding their exotic wave drives. A menacing Delfanit destroyer, bristling with weapons and its distinctive pulse tube drive glowing red.

And her own ship, a worn Human warp-freighter, looked thoroughly out of place. 

She sighed. Warp technology allowed humanity to spread among the stars, but it was crude compared to other species. Dangerous. Unpredictable. But it was the only FTL system humanity had mastered.

As Jenna descended the landing ramp, a Kantian port official approached to inspect her ship's registry and cargo. The Kantian's pale blue skin and delicate features were wrinkled in disapproval.

"Captain Marcks. Your ship is...three hours late for its scheduled arrival time. I trust there were no issues with your warp drive on this journey?" His tone suggested he fully expected issues with the temperamental Human technology.

Jenna kept her face neutral. "No problems, Administrator. Just minor delays during warp jumps, as usual."

The Kantian sniffed. "Very well. Your cargo and documentation seem to be in order. But I must remind you, Captain, that this port expects timely and reliable transportation. Your...unorthodox methods of faster-than-light travel do not inspire confidence in that regard."

"I understand, Administrator," Jenna replied coolly. "Is there anything else?"

He waved her away in dismissal. Jenna strode down the landing ramp, irritation rising within her. She was tired of the condescension from other species towards Humanity's achievements. Their warp drives may be crude, but they had allowed Humans to spread across a hundred light years in mere generations. They opened up the stars to human access, launching a thousand human colonies and outposts. 

For all the complaints about "unreliable" and "damn stupid" Human technology, her species was doing just fine. They didn't need elegant Kantian gates or fancy Maltiun wave-riders to rule their own little corner of the galaxy. 

Jenna smiled inwardly. Let the other species scoff. Humans would get on with the job using their own unorthodox methods, unsafe as they might be, and damn stupid or not. They opened the stars to humanity, and that was achievement enough.
