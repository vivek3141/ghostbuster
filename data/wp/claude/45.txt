The motorcade made its way down Pennsylvania Avenue as the crowds cheered. President-elect Mary Wilson gazed out at the sea of people who had gathered to witness her historic inauguration. After 234 years, she was about to become the first woman president of the United States. 

As the motorcade arrived at the Capitol building, Mary took a deep breath. She thought of all the female leaders and trailblazers who had come before her, the sacrifices they had made, the adversity they had faced. She hoped that her election meant that the nation was finally ready to judge candidates based on the content of their character, not on their gender or race or religion. She felt the weight of expectations, and the desire to prove that the highest glass ceiling could be shattered.

After the swearing-in ceremony, Mary approached the podium to deliver her inaugural address. She looked out over the National Mall, usually a sea of red caps, now filled for the first time with pink caps, a show of support and solidarity from women across the country.

"My fellow Americans," she began, "this is an historic day. Though I'm the one taking the oath of office, I want us to remember that this day belongs to all of us. It belongs to the generations of suffragists and advocates who fought to make this day possible. It belongs to the single moms and working women who are still fighting every day for equal treatment and equal rights."  

Mary continued, "When I was a little girl, there were no female presidents I could look to as role models. But today, girls across this nation will set their sights higher. They will know the ceiling is shattered. But achieving this milestone is not the endâ€”it's only the beginning. There is still much work left to do to make equal opportunity for all a reality."

"So America, this is our challenge, and this is our charge: to make progress on issues that still need urgent change. Together, we must pursue justice, equality, and human rights for people of all backgrounds. We must promote understanding over ignorance, empathy over apathy. The time for division and obstruction is over. The time for unity and progress is here."

Mary concluded, "Two centuries ago, our forefathers enshrined the words 'We the People' in our Constitution. Those words were a promise of democracy and justice, of a nation where 'all' really means 'all.' My fellow Americans, with your support, your courage, and your vision, we will at last fulfill the promise of 'We the People.' Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America!"

The crowd erupted in deafening cheers, pink caps waving in the air with pride and hope and joyful determination. A glass ceiling had shattered, but a new era of progress was just beginning. The future was bright, and the future was female.
