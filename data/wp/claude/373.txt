The critics had savaged my last book, calling the protagonist an "unlikable heroine" and the plot "meandering and pointless." Their words stung, but I was determined not to let them dictate my next story. 

I created a charming yet cruel antagonist, Gerald, who inflicted immense psychological damage on those around him. In the opening scene, he subtly undermines his new assistant, Clara, and manipulates her into doubting herself. The readers despise him but can't stop reading.

The story follows Gerald as he callously uses people to get ahead in his company. With a combination of flattery and veiled threats, he makes others do his dirty work. All the while, he presents himself as the likable rogue that people can't help but root for. 

My agent loves the story but asks me to make Gerald "a bit more human." I refuse. The readers need to truly understand what he is.

I weave in scenes of Gerald's backstory, showing the cruelty he endured in childhood. But I make clear that his past in no way excuses his present actions. If anything, it amplifies the tragedy of the damage he now inflicts on others. 

The story's climax comes when Clara realizes the depth of Gerald's deception and manipulation. But just as she is about to expose him, she hesitates. She has come to crave his approval and can't stand the thought of losing whatever shred of affection he has given her. She is trapped, and she does not even fully comprehend how or why.

In the final pages, Clara starts to see faint cracks in Gerald's charming facade. But she still can't bring herself to leave him. The ending is bleak and unsettling.

The reviews come out. The critics don't know what to make of this complex, multifaceted antagonist and his troubled yet compelling relationship with Clara. But they agree the story is brilliant and affecting. 

Gerald is a bastard, but a magnificent one. The readers cannot hate him any more than they can hate their own weakness in loving him. I have made them see themselves for who they really are. My antagonist, and the critics, are satisfied.
