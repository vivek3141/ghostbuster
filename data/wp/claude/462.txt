The old abandoned warehouse loomed over the small neighborhood, casting an eerie shadow in the moonlight. Everyone avoided it, saying it was haunted. Everyone except little Timmy, a curious 7-year old boy who didn't believe in ghosts or monsters. 

One night, Timmy's curiosity got the better of him. His parents were fast asleep as he slipped out of the house and made his way to the warehouse. The old metal door creaked open. Timmy peered inside, seeing nothing but darkness.

"Hello?" he called out. No response. He stepped in.

Suddenly, a burst of flame erupted in front of him, illuminating the cavernous space. A menacing figure stood before him, wreathed in fire. Two horns protruded from its head.

It was the devil himself.

Timmy gasped. The devil gave a sinister smile, his pointed teeth glinting.

"Well, well, well. What have we here? A little lost soul for me to claim?" the devil growled.

Timmy trembled but stood his ground. "I don't believe in the devil. My parents say you're not real."

The devil threw back his head and laughed. "Is that so? Then how do you explain me, little boy?" 

"You're just pretending. This is probably a magic trick."

The devil narrowed his eyes, annoyed by the boy's insistence. He waved his hands, conjuring up a flaming hellscape all around them. Screams of torment echoed in the distance.

"Do you still think this is a trick?" the devil hissed.

Timmy shook his head, eyes wide with fear. 

"Now do you believe, little boy? Are you ready to pledge your soul to me?"

Timmy's eyes filled with tears. The devil grinned, sensing victory.

"Please, Mr. Devil, don't take me to hell!" Timmy cried. "I don't want to go there. Hell seems so scary and lonely."

The devil snorted. "You should have thought of that before you wandered in here, boy! Now your soul is mine!" 

"But...but..." Timmy stammered. "Hell doesn't seem very nice. Even bad people don't deserve eternal punishment. Why would you want to be so mean?"

The devil stared at the little boy, taken aback. In thousands of years of tempting mankind, not a single soul had ever asked him that. His cruelty had never been questioned.  For the first time, a glimmer of doubt and regret crept into the devil's mind. 

He extinguished the flames with a wave of his hand. The hellscape disappeared, leaving them in darkness once again.   

"Be gone, foolish boy! Run back to your parents and do not return!" the devil snarled. But his usual malice was gone. 

Timmy's innocent question echoed in the devil's thoughts long after the boy had fled the warehouse, shaking the devil's belief in his wicked purpose. In that moment, the child had achieved what God could not â€“ he had made the devil doubt.
