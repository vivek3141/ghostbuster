The Birthday Balloons 

Jenny was turning 13 today and her parents had decided to throw her a surprise party. They invited over a dozen of her close friends and told them to arrive early while Jenny was at dance practice.

When Jenny returned home, she walked through the front door to a chorus of "Surprise!". Her friends jumped out from their hiding spots as her parents brought out a massive birthday cake, decorated with 13 lit candles.

"Make a wish!" her friends exclaimed. Jenny closed her eyes, made a wish, and blew out the candles. Her friends cheered.

Her parents then brought out a bouquet of 13 balloons - one for each year of her life. "Each balloon has a memory or prediction inside," her mother explained. "Pop them one by one to discover what's in store for your teenage years!"

Jenny popped the first balloon. A note fell out that read "Your first A in math, age 7". Jenny smiled as she remembered how proud she felt. 

The second balloon revealed: "Breaking your arm when learning to ride a bike, age 5". Jenny winced at the memory of the pain but laughed with her friends.

The notes in the next few balloons revealed more past memories: her first school dance, her favorite vacation, the time she lost her tooth.

When Jenny popped the 6th balloon, the note inside was different: "Dating your first crush, age 14". Jenny's cheeks turned red as her friends oohed and aahed, eager to know who the lucky boy would be.

The 7th balloon held another prediction: "Getting your first pet, a puppy!". Jenny gasped in delight. She had been asking her parents for a dog for years. Maybe this was a sign her wish would come true.

The remaining balloons held a mix of memories and future events, like joining the high school soccer team, learning to drive, and going to prom. The final balloon revealed one last surprise: "Graduating at the top of your class, age 18".  

Jenny felt overwhelmed with nostalgia and excitement. So much had already happened in her 13 years of life yet so much was still yet to come in her journey to adulthood.  

Her parents hugged her tightly. "We wanted to give you something to commemorate who you were, who you are, and who you're becoming," her mother said.  

"This was the best gift I could have asked for," Jenny replied. "Thank you for the memories and for giving me a glimpse into my future. I can't wait to see what's in store!"

Jenny left the party feeling deeply loved and filled with a mix of nostalgia for the past and eagerness for the adventures ahead. Her teenage years were sure to be memorable, and she would have her birthday balloons to look back on, reminding her of the girl she once was and the woman she was destined to become.
