The memory flashed into my mind as I walked down the street. A darkened alley, the glint of a knife, a cruel smile on a shadowy face. Fear  gripped me for a moment before I shook it off. That was another lifetime ago. 

Still, seeing that face in broad daylight shocked me. There, across the busy avenue, was the man who had murdered me in that alley. In another life, of course, but I recognized the eyes. The same pale, merciless eyes.

I froze in place, unsure of what to do. My first impulse was to dash across the street and confront him. But what would I even say? Did he still harbor the same violent impulses that ended my last life? I didn't want to become a victim again. I had been given another chance in this new life, and I didn't want to waste it on vengeance.

The light changed, and the crowd began to cross the street. But I remained still, watching as the man walked further and further away. He did not seem to recognize me at all. Why would he? I was in a different body now, on a different path. Our souls may have crossed before, but for now, we were strangers. 

I took a deep breath and continued walking, more shaken than I cared to admit. In truth, I didn't know what to make of this strange turn. Reincarnation was real, but what did that mean for justice and morality? He had never paid for his crime against me, and now here I was, inhabiting a new life while he continued on unpunished.

The injustice stung, even across lifetimes. But ultimately, I knew vengeance would only breed more of the same. My life was a fresh start, untouched by the violence of the past, and I was determined to keep it that way. I could not change what happened, but I could choose peace over retribution. 

As I rounded the corner, I paused for one last look at that familiar face now retreating into the crowd. I said a silent prayer, as much for myself as for him, that we would both make better choices this time around. And with that, I continued on into my new life, finally and fully free of the shadows of the old.
