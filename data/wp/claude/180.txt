The alarm chimed on Jenny's nightstand, pulling her out of a deep sleep. She blinked open one eye, then the other. 6:30 am. Right on schedule. 

With a groan, Jenny rose and shuffled to the bathroom. "Lights on, mirror on," she mumbled. The bathroom lights flickered on and her mirror display powered up, showing her reflection and various notifications. A reminder to take her daily supplements. The weather forecast - 72 and sunny, perfect convertible weather. And her schedule for the day including a 9 am video call with a client and a networking event downtown at 6 pm.

Jenny sighed, taking a moment to splash some water on her face and run her fingers through her short blonde hair. Just another day. She headed downstairs, stifling a yawn. 

“Morning,” came a gruff voice from the couch. Jenny's husband Mark was already up, watching the news with a mug of coffee in his hand. 

“Morning darling,” Jenny replied. She walked over and gave him a quick peck on the cheek before heading to the kitchen. “Anything exciting happening today?”

Mark snorted. “Depends on your definition of exciting. That big tech company announced another round of job cuts. And scientists discovered a new exoplanet that might support life. But life-changing? Not for us, unfortunately.”

“That’s probably for the best,” Jenny said, starting her morning routine of filling the kettle, measuring out portions for her oatmeal and almond latte. Their life might be ordinary, but it was comfortable. Predictable. And at this stage of their lives and careers, that’s really what they both craved.  

Mark nodded in agreement, taking another sip of coffee. “Speaking of jobs though, how’s the Millington case going? Still think you’ll land them as a new client?”

“I hope so. The partners seemed impressed with my proposal, but you never know.” Jenny poured the boiling water into her oatmeal cup and stuck it in the microwave. “I’m meeting with Danielle again today to go over next steps. Fingers crossed.”

“You’ll get them. You always do.” Mark smiled at his wife, pride evident on his face. Her career as a consultant was demanding, but she was damn good at what she did. 

Jenny grabbed her oatmeal and latte, joining Mark on the couch. They ate in comfortable silence, the news coverage shifting to the latest tech gadgets set to debut that week. “We’re certainly living in the future,” Jenny mused, glancing at their sleek home automation system, blinds and security. She didn't know how people lived without these kinds of conveniences.

Mark checked the time on his wrist display. “Speaking of which, I should head to the office. Early meeting with the West Coast team.” He gave Jenny another quick kiss before standing up and straightening his tie. 

“Good luck. I'll see you tonight?” she asked.

"Of course. Love you!" And with a wave, Mark headed out the door.

Jenny finished her breakfast, put the dishes in the washer and went upstairs to start getting ready for her day. Just another ordinary day, in their ordinary future life. But she wouldn't have it any other way.
