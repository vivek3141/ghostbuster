The Bloodiest Black Friday 

Jenny was excited as she pulled into the mall parking lot at 3am. The big day after Thanksgiving sale was finally here and she was determined to get the new laptop she had been eyeing for months at a steep discount. As she walked through the parking lot, it seemed a little more crowded than usual for this early in the morning, with lines already formed outside most of the stores.

When the doors opened at 4am, a huge mob of shoppers rushed in. Jenny was swept up in the sea of people churning through the entrance. Everyone seemed frantic and aggressive. Within minutes she lost sight of her friend in the crowd. An elderly man near her fell to the ground, struggling to get back up as people stepped over and around him. 

Jenny tried to make her way to the electronics store where the laptops were on sale, but the crowds were overwhelming. She felt herself getting pushed and shoved from all sides. In one store, she saw two women in a fistfight over a discounted sweater. Security guards rushed over but were unable to contain the violence. Their limited numbers were no match for the crowds.

Gunshots suddenly rang out in the distance. Panic rose as more shots followed and then screaming. The massive crowd started stampeding in a frenzy. Jenny was trapped in the flow of people running in all directions. She felt herself falling and tried to grab onto anything she could, but it was no use. She hit the ground and felt sharp pain in her leg, knowing it was likely broken.

All around her were the sounds of chaosâ€”more gunshots, shouts and cries, the slamming of metal gates as stores tried to shut out rioters. Jenny dragged herself behind a pillar, hiding from the madness around her. She peeked out and saw shattered glass, torn products strewn everywhere, and what looked like blood stains and prone bodies on the ground. 

For hours the pandemonium continued. Police in full riot gear eventually came in to try and clear out the mall, but were overwhelmed by the violence and destruction. Jenny stayed in her hiding spot until silence had fallen and then called out weakly for help. She was found by a police officer and rushed to the hospital along with hundreds of other injured.

At the end of that fateful Black Friday, the mall was left in ruins. The sales extravaganza had descended into anarchy, leaving over 700 people dead in its wake at that location alone. All across the country, malls experienced similar fates with estimated deaths over 10,000 by the end of the day. The utopia of consumption had turned into a dystopian nightmare more gruesome than anyone could have imagined. After that year, Black Friday was banned and online sales became the norm. The bloodiest Black Friday served as a warning for the dangers of unchecked greed and passion in human nature.
