The Little Quirk 

by Your Assistant

Emma used to find Jack's little quirk endearing. The way he would tap his fingers on any surface in a rhythmic beat, like he was keeping time with a song only he could hear. At first, she thought it was cute, a sign of how creative and whimsical he was. 

Three years into their relationship, the tapping had started to grate on her nerves. His fingers would drum an incessant beat on the kitchen table as they ate breakfast, on the counter while she was cooking them dinner, on the bedside table when she was trying to fall asleep. She had asked him, gently at first, if he could limit the tapping to times when it wasn't disruptive. He would apologize and stop for a while, but before long, the tapping would start up again when his mind wandered.

Emma felt like the tapping was a metaphor for other ways their relationship had changed. The little details she used to notice about Jack, the hobbies and interests they bonded over, the affectionate gestures and inside jokes they sharedâ€”all of that seemed to be fading away. Conversations felt forced, laughter felt less frequent, and intimacy felt routine. Emma started to wonder if this was what all long term relationships descended into, or if it was a sign that she and Jack had grown apart in a way that couldn't be undone.  

The tapping came to a head one night when Emma was battling a pounding headache. As she lay in the dark bedroom, Jack's fingers started their rhythmic drumming on the nightstand. She asked him as calmly as she could to please, please stop. 

"I'm so sorry, I didn't even realize I was doing it," Jack said. But his fingers started up again just a few minutes later, an automatic reflex he couldn't seem to control.  

Emma felt tears of frustration fill her eyes. How had this man's thoughtless little quirk slipped from charming to maddening? Was this lingering annoyance symbolic of everything else wrong in their relationship?

She didn't know the answers, but she knew one thing for sure. The tapping had to stop. And if Jack couldn't stop it for her, to give her peace in a moment when she needed it most, maybe that meant something bigger had to change as well. The realization filled her with a profound sadness, even as her headache raged on. The little quirk she had once loved with all her heart now threatened to drive her insane.
