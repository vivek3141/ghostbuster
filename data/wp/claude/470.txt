Every night I tell my girlfriend a bedtime story. It's our little ritual. No matter how busy our lives get, we always make time for a short story before we turn off the light. 

Tonight was different though. I had something important to ask her. My heart was pounding as I settled into my side of the bed. 

She snuggled up next to me, resting her head on my chest. "What story are you going to tell me tonight?"

I took a deep breath to steady my nerves. "Well, this is the story of a man who was very much in love with a kind, beautiful woman. From the moment he first saw her, he knew she was special. They bonded over little things at first, like their shared love of stargazing, photography, and mint chocolate chip ice cream."

She giggled at the familiar references. I smiled, gaining courage to continue.

"The man wanted to do something really special to show the woman just how much she meant to him. He thought and thought until he came up with the perfect idea. He was going to take her on a surprise trip to see the Northern Lights."  

"The woman had always dreamed of seeing the dazzling lights in person. The man arranged everything in secret. One night, he whisked her away to a cabin in the snowy north. She was stunned by all the details he had put into planning the getaway and making sure it was perfect for her. 

They spent hours gazing at the colorful, dancing lights in the sky. They were more radiant than either of them could have imagined. In that moment, he knew without a doubt that all was right in the world as long as they were together."

I paused, grasping for my phone on the nightstand. Her eyes went wide as I played the Aurora Borealis video I had cued up. The familiar greens and purples flickered over our faces in the dark room.

When the video ended, I took both of her hands in mine, gazing into her eyes. My heart felt like it might burst right out of my chest. "The man in the story knew there was one more thing he needed to do to make the night complete..." 

My voice caught in my throat as I slid off the bed and onto one knee. Her hands flew up to cover her mouth in surprise. 

"The woman he loved so deeply made him happier than he ever thought he could be. And he wanted to promise to feel that joy and share more adventures together every day for the rest of their lives." I pulled a ring from my pocket, hands trembling. "Sweetheart...will you please do me the immense honor of marrying me?"

Tears streamed down her cheeks as she nodded, launching herself into my arms. "Yes, of course I will! I love you so much!" I slid the ring onto her finger. 

When our lips finally parted, I smiled softly. "And they lived happily ever after. The end." My fianc√©e. The story had a perfect ending.
