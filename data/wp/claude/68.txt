Jake sighed as he peeled off his supersuit after another long night of patrol. The Kevlar-infused fabric was coated in grime and who knows what else from the seedy alleyways. He threw the suit in the wash, hoping the "machine washable" claim was accurate. 

The next morning, Jake went to transfer the suit to the dryer but noticed the "Like colors only" warning. In his exhausted state last night, he had tossed the iconic blue and red suit in with a new load of whites. The colors had bled all over, turning his supersuit a sickly purple and his whites a blotchy pink.

Panicked, Jake ran out to buy new detergent, color remover, anything to fix this disaster. After a few failed attempts, he realized with dawning horror that the suit's color was permanently altered. How could he continue to inspire hope in Metroburg looking like an eggplant?

Jake's phone rang. The police chief said a toxic spill had gridlocked downtown traffic. Jake's heart sank, knowing what he had to do. 

A few minutes later, onlookers gawked at the bizarre purple blur zooming through the city, solving problems at super speed. After directing traffic for hours in his ruined suit, jokes and memes popped up online. But to his surprise, citizens seemed endeared to the foolishly earnest hero who let a laundry mishap sideline him. Jake smiled, realizing being a superhero was about more than just the super suit.
