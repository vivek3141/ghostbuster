Well that wasn't my brightest moment. I looked at the shattered remains of my grandmother's prized vase, the one she always proudly displayed on the mantle, and cringed. How could I have been so careless? 

I was practicing my soccer juggling skills in the living room, something I knew was forbidden. But Gram was out and I figured if I was careful, what could go wrong? Well, a poorly timed kick sent the ball flying, knocking over the vase in the process. There was no way I could hide this.

When Gram returned home, I had to confess. I braced myself for anger, disappointment, tears. Instead, she just sighed. "Accidents happen, dear. I'm not mad. But from now on, we keep the ball outside, yes?" She gave me a hug. 

I learned two things that day. One, listen to your grandmother's rules. And two, the most precious things in life are the moments we share together. A shattered vase is fleeting, but the love of family is forever. My brightest moment was realizing just how lucky I was to have my Gram. And following her rules from that day on was the least I could do to show my gratitude.
