The thick jungle stretched as far as the eye could see, an endless sea of green under the harsh African sun. Praetorian Decimus wiped the sweat off his brow as he trudged back to the small Roman outpost. His armor felt heavier with each step, as if the horrific memories were weighing him down.

Only a week ago, Decimus had embarked with the mighty 14th Legion on a diplomatic mission to make contact with a new tribe discovered deep in the Congo. They brought gifts of wine and olive oil, gold and jewels, all displays of Rome's might and wealth. Their mission was simple: make allies of these people to help ensure safe passage for Roman ships along the western coast of Africa. 

After days of marching through dense forest, they finally made contact. The tribesmen were strange and primitive, communicating in grunts and gestures. But they seemed open to friendship. A feast was held, gifts were exchanged, and all signs pointed to success.

Until dusk fell. The legion made camp for the night, posting sentries as usual. All was quiet. And then a sound rang out that Decimus knew he would never forget. An unearthly roar, like some beast from the underworld. The cries of men followed, along with the familiar ring of sword on scale.

Decimus rushed toward the sounds, only to stop dead in his tracks. Towering over one of his comrades was a creature he recognized only from faded mosaics in Rome: an immense reptile, 30 feet long, with razor sharp teeth and claws to match. A beast that should not exist. It shook the lifeless body of the sentry, then turned its cold eyes on Decimus.

He screamed the alarm and swung his sword with all his might. But blades and spears seemed only to glance off the iron-hard scales. The creature swung its tail, knocking several legionaries to the ground with a sickening crunch.All around them in the darkness, more nightmarish roars arose. They were surrounded.

The battle was a massacre. The once-proud 14th Legion, heroes of Rome, scrambled in retreat from the jaws and claws of impossible beasts thought long extinct. Decimus ran as he had never run before, hearing the screams of his comrades fading behind him one by one.

By dawn, the forest was silent again. Decimus stumbled back to camp in a daze, his armor battered and torn. Only a handful of survivors remained, their eyes hollow with shock. The tribesmen and their village had vanished without a trace. 

And now Decimus marched back to the outpost under the same harsh sun, struggling under the weight of understanding that these were not savage tribesmen they had encountered, but cunning beasts that adopted the guise of men. His implausible report would make its way back to Rome, a warning from the depths of history: there were older and more fearsome things than the glory of the empire, and lands that would forever remain unconquered. The 14th Legion had ventured where men were not meant to go.
