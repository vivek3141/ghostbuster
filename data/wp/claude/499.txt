The blank page stared back at me, daring me to write. I knew I had to start somewhere. The list of writing prompts seemed endlessâ€”too many choices. 

Personal preference only got me so far. I needed more objective criteria to choose a prompt worth pursuing. Originality mattered. No point in writing to a tired or overused theme. Surprise and unpredictability were key.

Emotional resonance counted for a lot. If a prompt evoked a visceral reaction or memory, that was a sign I might connect with the topic. The prompt had to spark an idea I cared enough about to develop. It couldn't just lead to an emotionless rumination.

Range and versatility were also important. I didn't want to keep choosing similar kinds of prompts in the same style or perspective. Challenge and growth come from venturing outside comfort zones. A prompt that expanded my repertoire or pushed me in new directions gained extra points.

In the end, the prompt I selected had to light a fire, an excitement to create something new. Like threading a needle, it took patience and persistence to find the right match between prompt and passion. When the magic happened, the blank page didn't seem quite so blank anymore. The words began to flow.That was the only true test of a winning prompt for me. When the writing ignited.
