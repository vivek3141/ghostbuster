The Chrono-Casanova 

It was a rainy Saturday evening in 1952 when John fiddled with the dials on his time machine. He had spent years building the contraption from spare parts in his garage, and tonight was the night he would finally test it out. His goal: to travel back in time and woo the girl of his dreams, Betty Sue Myers. 

John set the dials for 10 years in the past, to 1942. He emerged from the time tunnel to find young Betty Sue, a mere 15 years old, hanging laundry in her backyard. His attempts at flirting were met with giggles and confusion from the teen. Dejected, John returned to the present. 

Not deterred, John tried again, this time travelling to 1947 to court the comely 20-year-old Betty Sue. However, his uncouth advances merely earned him a stern scolding and the door slammed in his face by Betty Sue's father.

On his third attempt in 1949, John finally won over the charmed 22-year-old Betty Sue with his manners and charm. After a whirlwind romance, they married, and John brought his new bride into the present with him. 

At first, Betty Sue was enthralled with the modern world of 1952. But soon, strange encounters with oddly familiar men began to unnerve her. One evening, a disheveled man burst into their home, claiming to be an older version of her husband from the future, there to warn her of the “mistake” she was making. The bizarre happenings multiplied until Betty Sue could take no more. She left John and his time machine behind, escaping to a quiet life in the countryside where the only strange things were the notions and nonsense of so-called “science”.

And so the chrono-casanova John was left alone with but the memory of the woman he had won and lost, thrice over, thanks to the paradoxes of time travel and the follys of an unschooled heart. The end.
