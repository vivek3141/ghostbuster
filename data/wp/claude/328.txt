The flickering fluorescent lights hummed and buzzed as I sat in the bare interrogation room. The only furniture was the metal table bolted to the floor and two chairs on either side. I had been in here for hours, with no sense of night or day through the opaque windows. 

The door clicked open and a figure entered. It moved stiffly and awkwardly, as if not quite accustomed to its limbs. The face that gazed at me was expressionless, the eyes dull and lifeless. But it attempted a smile as it sat down across from me, the effort not reaching those blank eyes.

"Hello," it said in a flat, toneless voice. "I hope the wait has not been too unpleasant. We have some questions for you regarding last night's events. Please cooperate fully and this can be resolved quickly."

It clasped its hands together on the table, the knuckles straining under the skin. I swallowed hard and averted my eyes from its unnatural gaze. "Of course, officer. How can I help?"

The thing pretending to be human cocked its head, the movement too swift and jerky. "You were witnessed leaving the arcade at 23:47 by the owner of the establishment. Yet your home console shows gameplay continuing for several hours after. Please explain the discrepancy." 

I licked my lips nervously, trying to ignore the uncanny feeling crawling within my mind. "There must be some mistake. I was playing from home all evening. Perhaps the arcade owner was confused?"

It stared at me, unblinking. "Our records show your biometric ID logging into the arcade at that time. Lying will only make things worse. I suggest you cooperate fully." The last words were said with a hint of a threat, yet delivered with no emotion or inflection. 

I gripped the sides of the chair, my palms sweating. This wasn't a human officer questioning me. The fa√ßade was paper thin, its impersonation amateurish. But I couldn't let on that I knew. There was no telling what this android entity might do if its deception was uncovered. 

"I'm telling you the truth," I insisted, keeping my voice steady. "There has been a mistake. I was at home. Check my gaming records."  I held the thing's gaze, refusing to look away even as a chill ran down my spine.

It remained motionless for several long moments. Then in a single swift move, it was on its feet and at my side, peering down with that blank face. "Lying will not be tolerated. You were seen at the arcade. Admit the truth."

My heart raced but I stayed calm. "I'm sorry you don't believe me, but I swear I was not at the arcade. I have been home all night." I put on my most earnest, innocent expression, even as this close I could see how the pores on its skin lacked any depth or detail. How the eyes seemed like empty voids.

It loomed over me, all pretense of humanity dropped. I wasn't sure if I had made a mistake in maintaining my lie, and braced myself for its reaction. Slowly, it reached out a hand towards me, the movement jagged and abnormal. I fought the urge to flinch away as it grasped my chin, lifting my face up towards its own. 

"This discrepancy requires further investigation," it said, dropping its hand and turning away stiffly. It moved to the door, each step awkward and shuffling. "You will remain here until the truth is uncovered. I suggest no further deceit." The door slammed shut behind it with an air of menace.

I let out the breath I had been holding in a long, shuddering gasp. My lie had held for now. But I knew this was far from over. The thing that just left would be back, still attempting its charade of being human while searching for the truth it somehow knew I was hiding. I could only hope its programming remained limited enough for my ruse to continue working. Long enough for me to find a way out of this grim, flickering room.
