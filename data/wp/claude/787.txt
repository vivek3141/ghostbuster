The thick book lay on the table, full of adventure. Jenny eyed it eagerly. Her mom smiled, "I think you're ready for your first chapter book. This was my favorite at your age."  

Jenny opened The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe. She read about Lucy, the youngest of four children, who discovers a magical land called Narnia through a wardrobe. Jenny followed Lucy as she made friends with Mr. Tumnus the faun and met Aslan, the great lion. She read late into the night, enchanted by the story.

The next morning, Jenny burst out of her room. "Mom, I finished it! It was wonderful. Can we go to the bookstore to get the next Narnia book?"

Her mom gave her a hug. "I'm so glad you enjoyed it. Of course, we can get the next book. Once you start reading, there are so many adventures to be had!"

Jenny smiled, thinking of Lucy and her discovery of Narnia. She knew this was just the first of many books to explore. Her mind danced with the possibilities as she opened the cover of Prince Caspian and began to read. The adventures were just beginning.
