The old warehouse loomed in front of me, holding memories of a past life. I walked through the rusted metal door and my footsteps echoed in the empty space. 

In the middle of the room stood a lone chair. A bare lightbulb hung above, casting a dim circle of light. I walked into the light and sat down, resting my hands on the cold metal arms of the chair. 

I stared into the darkness, remembering the last time I was here. So many years ago now, but the memories were still razor sharp in my mind. 

A door squeaked open and heavy footsteps approached. A tall figure emerged from the shadows, stopping just outside the light. I took a deep breath and steeled myself for the confrontation that was about to come.

"It's been a long time," said the man in a gravelly voice as he stepped into the light. His icy blue eyes peered at me, sizing me up. He hadn't changed. Not one bit.

"Yes it has," I replied calmly. 

"Why did you do it?" he asked abruptly. His eyes bored into me, searching for a reaction. But I gave none. I had been anticipating this question for years. My answer was ready.

"You gave me no choice."

He slammed his fist down on a table, making me jump. "No choice?" he roared. "You betrayed me! You were the only one I trusted and you turned your back on me!"

I took a deep breath to slow my racing heart. "You forced my hand. I did what I had to do to stop you." 

"What *you* had to do?" He gave a bitter laugh. "You did it for yourself. For your own selfish reasons."

I shook my head. "No. I did it for all the people whose lives you destroyed. Who you would have continued to destroy had I not intervened. I couldn't sit by and watch that happen."

He leaned down, placing his hands on the arms of the chair, locking me in place. "You'll regret this. I will make you suffer for your betrayal. No one crosses me and gets away with it. No one!"

I stared defiantly into his eyes. "Do your worst. I have no regrets. I'd do it all again to stop you. To see you fall. That's why I did it. I did it to end your reign of terror. Once and for all." 

His eyes blazed with anger and his breath hissed through clenched teeth. For a moment I wondered if he was going to kill me right then and there. My heart pounded in my chest but I didn't look away.  

Finally he pushed himself away from the chair and stalked to the edge of the light. "This isn't over," he growled before disappearing into the shadows. The door banged shut behind him and I was left alone in the silence. I had no doubt he meant what he said. But I was ready for whatever was to come. I had done what needed to be done. And I would gladly do it again.
