I sighed as I looked at the pile of ingredients laid out on my counter. Flour, eggs, milk, chocolate chipsâ€”everything I needed to make chocolate chip cookies for Klorp and Zimzoob, my new alien friends. They had been so excited when I invited them over for an "authentic human baking experience." If only they knew of my abysmal cooking skills. 

When the Zorbians first made contact with Earth, we were shocked by how much their society revolved around food. Meals were short, bland cubes of nutrients, and they rarely socialized over eating. Once they tasted real human food though, rich in flavor and variety, they became utterly obsessed. Their leaders quickly realized that controlling access to tasty snacks was the best way to reward and manipulate the population.

A loud knock on my door startled me out of my worrying. I opened it to find Klorp and Zimzoob, their eyestalks already extended eagerly. "Greetings, human friend Clara!" said Klorp. "We are most excited for this baking ritual."

"Welcome, friends! Come on in," I said, ushering them inside. Their eyestalks zoomed to the mess on the counter. 

"Is that...chocolate we detect?" asked Zimzoob. I nodded, and they gripped each other, emitting a high pitched squealing noise. This was going to be interesting.

The baking process started out well enough. They laughed at the strange textures, amazed by the sugar and butter. But as soon as I opened the oven to put the cookies in, billows of smoke came pouring out. I had forgotten to preheat the oven. Again. 

Klorp and Zimzoob looked at each other in confusion. I gave an embarrassed smile. "My apologies. I seem to have made an error. Let me...try again."

They eagerly helped me roll out a new batch of dough and place them on the now preheated cookie sheet. I set a timer to avoid burning them again. When the timer dinged, I opened the oven to find flat, crispy, inedible discs where plump chocolate chip cookies should be.  I had forgotten baking soda. 

By the third failed batch, Klorp and Zimzoob's eyestalks were drooping in disappointment. I was ready to give up in shame when Klorp said gently, "Clara, do not feel sadness. We appreciate your effort in sharing this experience with us."

"You are a treasured friend," added Zimzoob, "even if you are not the most proficient baker."

I gave them a grateful smile. "Thank you for your patience and understanding. I promise, no more baking! Now, how about we just go out for some delicious pizza instead?" 

Their eyestalks shot back up with excitement. "Pizza! What a splendid idea." My alien friends were pleased, my culinary dignity was salvaged, and I resolved to leave the baking to the professionals from now on.
