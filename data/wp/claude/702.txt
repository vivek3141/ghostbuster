You wiped the rain off your coat as you entered your kitchen back door. Ugh, another long day. But wait - what was that? Something  was different. Very different.
Sitting there, utterly incongruous, was a polished black grand piano. 
Your tired brain struggled to make sense of it. There must be some logical explanation. Perhaps you sleepwalked to the store and bought it in a fugue state? Or did a helpful neighbor slip it in as a surprise?
No, those were ridiculous. This was impossible. Pianos don’t just appear out of nowhere.
Yet here it  was, its lacquered surface reflecting the overhead light, its ivory keys   
glowing.  
Your fingers drifted onto the cool keys, taping out a hesitant scale. The notes resonated  through the kitchen, filling the space with a melody you didn’t know you had in you. 
The music swelled, chasing away your questions and confusion. Only the song mattered now, pouring out of your fingertips as if you had known it all your life.  
When the final chord faded, you blinked as if waking from a dream. The rain had stopped. In that moment, it no longer seemed strange to have a piano in the kitchen. Perhaps it had been there all along, waiting for you to arrive home and bring it to life.
