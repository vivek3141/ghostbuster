The world was stunned when the Canadian Prime Minister appeared on every screen across the globe, smiling politely as always. 

“Good day, everyone. As you know, Canadians have a reputation for being polite and courteous. The truth is, we have only been nice so that the entire world would owe us a favor. And today, we are calling in each and every one of those favors.”

The PM went on to list a series of absurd demands. The Stanley Cup and Super Bowl trophies were to be awarded to Canadian teams for the next 25 years.  Hollywood must produce big-budget films highlighting notable Canadians like Norman Bethune and Sir Frederick Banting. Every restaurant worldwide must add poutine and maple bacon to their menus. Justin Bieber albums would top the charts in every country for the next decade. 

At first, no one took the demands seriously. But soon world leaders realized that Canadians had been playing the long game. With their kindness and politeness over decades and centuries, they had stealthily infiltrated our societies and cultures.   Canadians had become globally beloved. No one wanted to upset them.

Begrudgingly, countries started complying with the demands. Tributes to Canadian culture spread like wildfire. Canadian flags appeared on landmarks everywhere. “O Canada” was sung at sporting events worldwide.  Critics argued this was unfair manipulation, but public support for Canada was too strong.

A year later, Canada retracted all demands. The PM appeared once more, smiling sheepishly. “Sorry about that, everyone. We were just joking around. We appreciate the favors, but being nice is just in our nature. No need to pay us back!”

Yet their politeness and the favors they accumulated will never be forgotten. Canada's grand manipulation and ultimate show of kindness cemented their status as rulers of the civilized world, even without asking. The rest of the world was left scratching their heads, impressed and outplayed in the most Canadian of ways.
