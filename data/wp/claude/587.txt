The crackling of the wood fueled fire was soothing as I stared into its flames, alone with my thoughts as night fell over the cabin. As usual, my mind wandered back to that fateful day 2 years ago. The day my world changed. 

It was supposed to just be a regular sorting day in the mine, separating the good gems from the debris. But one blast of dynamite changed everything. When the ringing in my ears faded and the dust settled, the devastating sight greeted my eyes. My right hand was gone, trapped under a boulder, torn from my arm. I screamed until my throat was raw as my coworkers rushed to my aid.

The doctor said he had no choice but to amputate what remained of my right arm to save my life from infection. I survived, but as a now one-armed man struggling to adjust to a harsh new reality. At first, the simplest tasks seemed insurmountable. How would I continue my work in the mine? Care for myself? Cope with the aching loss and phantom pains?

The answer is not easily. But day by day, week by week, I learned. My left hand grew stronger and more dexterous out of necessity. I learned to do almost everything one-handed, though some days were still a struggle. The mine continued to employ me, though now in a reduced capacity. Life marched on.

Though my days are long behind that dark time, at night when I close my eyes to sleep, a miracle happens. In my dreams, I have two hands again. Two strong, callused hands that can grasp pickaxes and shovels, gently hold the hand of a lover, play a tune on the old saloon piano. In my dreams, I am whole. 

I wake each morning and for a brief moment, flex the fingers of my right hand by instinct before realizing it was just a dream. The phantom limb is a curse and a blessing. But in the moments before sleep finds me each night, I stare into the fire and concentrate, willing my mind to dream of hands, of wholeness. Just for a little while. And when I dream, I have two hands again.
