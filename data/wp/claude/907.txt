The light faded around me as I took my last breath at the age of 72. When I opened my eyes, I found myself in a familiar yet strange place. It was my living room, but brighter and more vibrant. I looked down at my hands. They were wrinkled and age-spotted, just as before. 

A warm voice said, "Welcome. You will stay as you were when you passed, and grow younger each day."

It was confusing, but as the days went on, it felt natural. Each morning I woke to find my hair a bit darker, my skin a bit smoother. Memories from my 72 years lingered, but began to feel detached, like scenes from an old movie. My worries and physical pains slipped away as the years reversed.

At 64, arthritis pain left my joints and a familiar vigor returned. At 52, my children's teenage antics no longer exasperated me. By my 40s, I felt in my prime again. My 30s brought a sense of adventure. In my 20s, the world seemed open and full of possibilities once more.

Each day, I caught glimpses of others who were older or younger, progressing in reverse. We were all journeying at our own pace to some unknown destination. There were familiar faces, people I had known in life who were also growing younger, gradually forgetting what had come before. 

In my teens, raging hormones and fleeting angst revisited. Childhood brought a simple joy I had long since forgotten. At 10 years old, I rolled down grassy hills and climbed trees without a care, deeply connected to the present moment. 

The final stage was infancy. My world narrowed until there was only the warmth of my caretaker's embrace and my most basic needs being met. Eventually, there was but a single point of light, and the faint, steady beat of my heart.

Then, after what seemed an eternity yet no time at all, I emerged once more into the bright warmth. But this was different. A new life, a new chance, had begun. The cries of an infant filled the room as my new eyes opened, and I took my first breath yet again. The cycle had started anew. I had returned home.
