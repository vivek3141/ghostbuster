The Galactic Preserve 

Lieutenant T'naa stared out the viewport of the science vessel Antares, looking at the jewel of a planet below. "Earth," she said, "the humans have named it Earth."

Her superior, Sub-Commander Traa'ac, joined her. "Looks unremarkable. But the Preservers have declared it must remain undisturbed. We must catalog it and move on."

"Yes sir," T'naa said, though she felt a pang of wistfulness. To find a new sentient species at the dawn of interstellar travel was thrilling. But the Preservers had been clear in their mandate. This sector of space was to remain a natural reserve, untouched by the warring Empires on either side. Neutral space. 

And so, the Antares hovered in the outer reaches of the solar system, collecting data through discreet scans and sensors. They tracked whale songs, chatter on communication networks, vibrations of machinery. The humans were clever, industrious, though blissfully unaware of the wider galaxy around them.

"Sir, at their current rate of technological progress, the humans will achieve primitive interstellar travel in a few decades," T'naa said. "Just a short FTL hop to their nearest star. What then?"

Traa'ac straightened. "Then we must enact containment procedures. We will isolate their star system using nullspace dampeners to cut them off. All hyperspace lanes in or out will be collapsed."

T'naa felt a surge of sadness for the humans, forever trapped in their tiny pocket of space. But the Preservers had been resolute in their decision. This world was to remain pristine, separated from the perils and wonders of the wider galaxy.

A day later, the work was done. All traces of their presence erased. The containment field was in place, cutting off the solar system from the network of hyperspace lanes that knit the galaxy together. 

As the Antares blinked into FTL travel, T'naa took one last look at the pale blue dot on her screen. She whispered a quick prayer to the humans below. May your world remain peaceful. May you never know the sorrow of the great galactic wars to come. In ignorance, may you find bliss.

The planet Earth receded into the inky black of space and was gone. Silently orbiting its distant sun, the world remained a preserve of natural wonder, untouched by contact from the stars.
