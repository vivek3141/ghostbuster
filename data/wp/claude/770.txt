I opened my eyes. Again, I was in this same unfamiliar room. It had been three days now since I had woken up in a new body and time.  

At first, it was exciting—the mystery, the adventure of discovering a new life and era. Two days ago, I was a sailor on a 16th century Spanish galleon, living a life of swashbuckling and rum. The day before that, I woke up as a pioneer woman in the early American west. It was hard but thrilling work building a homestead.

Now I was getting worried. Was I stuck? Had my strange ability to shapeshift through lives abandoned me? If I was trapped in this foreign existence, I didn’t even know enough details to fake my way through it. 

I walked over to the mirror, afraid of what I might see. But it was my own familiar face staring back at me. I was in my own comfortable bedroom, in my own time. I had shifted back to myself. 

Relief flooded through me. My strange gift had not disappeared—it seemed it had just granted me a respite, allowed me to return home after too much adventure across the vast expanse of human history. I smiled at my reflection knowingly. The possibilities were still endless. I never knew where I might wake up next. The uncertainty and mystery remained, but now I felt recharged and ready to explore whatever life waited for me when I closed my eyes again.
