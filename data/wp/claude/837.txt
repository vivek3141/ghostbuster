The clock reads 11:34 pm. I feel my heart skip a beat as I realize the significance of the time. This is the hour I have known about for years but could never pinpoint -- the hour of my death. 

When I was 12 years old, I had a vivid dream of looking at a digital clock as it turned to 11:34 pm. In the dream, I felt a sense of finality, of my life coming to an end. When I woke with a start, the time seemed burned into my memory. At first, I dismissed it as just a dream. But over the following days and weeks, I couldn't shake the feeling that it meant something. That it was a premonition of when I would die.

I told my parents about the dream, hoping they would reassure me that it was nonsense. But their troubled looks only confirmed my fear that they thought it could be real. We went to doctors and experts, all who said there was no way to know if it was a prediction or just a dream. They advised me not to dwell on it or let it rule my life. 

Easier said than done. For years, every time the clocked ticked towards 11:34 pm, my heart would race and I'd wonder if this was the night. The not knowing has been a curse. I tried to live every day like it could be my last but also plan for the future. It was an impossible tightrope to walk.

A few times, I came close to finding out the date. A bad bout of pneumonia at age 16, a reckless night of drinking at 21 that led to alcohol poisoning. Each time, as I faded in and out of consciousness, I checked the clock hoping for 11:34 but also hoping the time would pass uneventfully. I recovered each time, but the close calls only intensified my anxiety about the fateful hour.

Now here I am, age 32, looking at the clock in my living room as it turns to 11:34 pm. My heart stops for a long moment. I wait for something to happen, for the ending I have feared for so long. But the seconds continue ticking by. 11:35 comes and goes. I realize I've been holding my breath and let it out in a long sigh. 

Just a dream. After all these years of worry and anticipation, it was just an ordinary dream. I feel the fear and weight of the last 20 years lift from my shoulders. I start to laugh, first a chuckle and then a full laugh of relief and joy and feeling foolish. But alive. I sit back in my chair, still laughing, and realize that for the first time in a long time, I have my whole life ahead of me. The future is unwritten. And the present is a gift. I plan to live each moment of it.
