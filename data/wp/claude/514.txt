The old cabin sat nestled in the woods, half-hidden behind overgrown bushes and vines. Jill walked up the creaking steps of the porch and stopped at the door. She took a deep breath, her fingers brushing the familiar wood grain. 
It had been 10 years since she last came here, 10 years since that summer with Mark. They had promised each other they would always come back, that this place would be theirs to escape to.

Jill slid the key into the lock, the metal scraping from lack of use. The door swung open with a groan, awakening the musty air inside.
“It’ll be just like it was before. Trust me,” Mark had said when he asked her to meet him here for the weekend. His call had come out of the blue, stirring up emotions she thought she had buried. But Jill had agreed, hoping to find whatever it was they had lost.

The cabin was smaller than she remembered. A thin layer of dust coated the furniture, the windows smudged and dingy. Jill ran her hand across the tabletop, pausing at the marks they had carved into the wood that summer. 
She wandered into the tiny kitchen, gripping the counter to steady herself. She could still see Mark there, bare-chested, grinning as he made them sandwiches and lemonade each day.  Her heart clenched at the memory of how happy they were, how her world had revolved around his smiles and laughter.

A creak from the floorboards upstairs made her freeze. “Hello?” she called tentatively.
Silence greeted her. But as she climbed the stairs, the sounds of drawers opening and closing told her Mark was already there.

At the top, Jill’s breath caught in her throat. Mark stood with his back to her, rummaging in an old dresser, still tall and broad-shouldered. Her heart tripped over itself.  
He turned, his familiar grin lighting up his face. “You came.”
Jill nodded, words escaping her. She had nearly forgotten how it felt to be the sole focus of his dazzling blue eyes.
Mark walked over and wrapped her in his arms without hesitation. “I’ve missed you Jilly. It’s always been you. I was just too stubborn to realize it.”

Jill blinked back tears as she leaned into his embrace. The last decade fell away, leaving her 18 again and dizzy with love. 
The weekend passed in a haze of laughter and rediscovery. On their last day, Mark pulled Jill into his arms as a summer storm rolled in, the rain obscuring everything outside the cabin walls.
“Don’t leave me again,” he whispered, his breath warm against her cheek.  
Jill smiled and surrendered to the familiar cadence of his heart, beating in time with her own. “I won’t. I promise.”
The End.
