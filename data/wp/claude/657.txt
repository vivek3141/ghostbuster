The massive alien warships descended from the red sky, casting ominous shadows over the sprawling human city below. Supreme Commander Zax grinned, revealing a mouth full of razor sharp teeth, as he gazed out the front viewing port of his flagship. 

"The dinosaurs have gone extinct, just as we had hoped," he growled to his second in command. "These soft, fleshy creatures that have replaced them do not appear nearly as formidable. This time, the planet shall be ours!"

The last time Zax's alien race had invaded Earth, they had been unprepared for the mighty dinosaurs that dominated the land. The beasts had proven remarkably resistant to their advanced weapons and the aliens were forced to retreat in disgrace, vowing to one day return when the dinosaurs had died out. After a long voyage across the stars, that day had finally come.

Zax's massive army poured out of the warships, weapons glowing, ready to overrun the human capitol. But to their surprise, their attack did not proceed as planned. The humans, though small, proved remarkably adaptable and resilient. Strange metallic birds flew through the sky, raining fire upon the invaders. Other mechanical contraptions rolled across the land, crushing alien attackers under their treads.

While the aliens had evolved formidable natural weapons like claws, spikes, and razor sharp teeth during their long history of warfare, the humans had progressed in an unexpected direction. They had developed advanced tools, weapons, and machines that more than made up for their lack of physical prowess. Each new alien strategy was countered by the humans with alarming speed and ingenuity. 

Supreme Commander Zax hissed in rage as yet another alien attack was repelled by the humans' bizarre but effective defenses. It seemed the dinosaurs were not the only formidable foes this little planet had bred. After a week of unending defeats, Zax reluctantly gave the order to retreat from this perplexing world once again. As the warships lifted off and soared away from Earth, Zax wondered grimly if they had merely traded one world of monsters for another. The creatures known as humans were small but fierce - and the aliens had no desire to return anytime soon.
