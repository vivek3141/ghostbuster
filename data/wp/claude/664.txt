I decided it was time for my new friend Jane to meet my other friends. We made plans to meet up at a local bar for some drinks and socializing. 

When we arrived, the first friend I introduced Jane to was Mark, the embodiment of pride. Mark only talked about himself, his many accomplishments and his lavish lifestyle the entire time. He didn't ask Jane a single question, just droned on about his designer clothes and the exotic trips he had been on recently. Jane gave me a look as if to say "Really?" I shrugged apologetically.

Next we chatted with Ashley, the perfect picture of lust. Ashley sized up every attractive man in the bar, commenting on their physiques and guessing what they might be like in bed. She barely made eye contact with Jane as she was too busy scanning the room for her next potential conquest. Jane seemed slightly uncomfortable with Ashley's one-track mind and objectification of the men around us.

We then moved on to Brian who exemplified sloth. He could barely be bothered to look up from his phone to greet Jane. When I introduced them and Jane reached out her hand for a handshake, Brian just nodded his head and gave a slight wave of his fingers, then went back to scrolling through social media. Jane raised her eyebrows in disbelief at his rudeness and apathy. 

Gluttony was represented fully in my friend Melissa. While chatting, Melissa had consumed 3 hamburgers, an entire basket of french fries, 4 beers and half a chocolate cake. She asked Jane question after question about food, not even pausing for a response before shoving more cake into her mouth. Crumbs littered the front of Melissa's shirt which she didn't seem to even notice in her insatiable quest for more food.  

Jane desperately needed a break so I took her to the bar for another drink. There we ran into Mike who exemplified greed. Within minutes of meeting Jane, Mike was trying to sell her on some "hot stock tips" and "get rich quick" schemes. He bragged about deals he had made that earned him fortunes, though I knew most of his tales were fabricated or exaggerated. His eyes lit up as he talked about money and I could see Jane wished she could escape his sales pitch.

Continuing our tour of friends, we met Debbie whose envy was immediately apparent. She interrogated Jane on where she lived, what her job was and what kind of car she drove. With every detail Jane shared, Debbie's eyes narrowed further. She made passive aggressive comments about Jane's nice handbag and how she could never afford quality goods like that. Jane started to become visibly irked by Debbie's resentment and spite. 

Finally, we encountered Thomas who embodied wrath. Within minutes of a casual introduction, Thomas had insulted two strangers walking by, berated the bartender for being slow with his drink order and went into an expletive-filled rant about the most trivial issues. His face grew red as his anger intensified over nothing. Jane leaned over and whispered to me that she had never met someone so angry and abrasive. She said she felt his wrath was palpable.

At the end of the evening, Jane thanked me for inviting her out but said she wasn't sure my group of friends were the kind of people she wanted to spend more time with. I apologized, embarrassed that I had subjected her to the seven deadly sins in one outing. Needless to say, we kept our future get-togethers confined to just the two of us from that point on.
