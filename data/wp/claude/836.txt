The assassin peered through the scope of his rifle, the target in his sights. Senator Jensen was making a speech on the steps of the Capitol, surrounded by aides and journalists. 

His finger caressed the trigger as he aimed at the Senator's heart. So easy, he thought. Just a little pressure, a quick pull. But something held him back.

You can't kill me, not today. The words echoed in his mind, unfamiliar yet compelling. His instincts screamed to take the shot, to fulfill his contract. His muscles strained to obey.

But his finger relaxed off the trigger. He let the moment pass. The crowd dispersed, the Senator headed inside.

The assassin packed up, confused and frustrated. He had never failed before. Those words kept repeating in his mind on his long drive home. 

Days later, a news alert flashed on his phone: "Senator Jensen rushed to hospital after heart attack." If not for that mysterious voice staying his hand, he would have killed a man already on the brink of death.

He never took another life. The Senator's reprieve, those words of prophecy, awakened a slumbering conscience he never knew he possessed. Sometimes fate protects us in strange ways, even from ourselves. Not today, the voice had said. And so a life was saved, and a life was changed.
