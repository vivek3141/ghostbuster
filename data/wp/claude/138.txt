Business was booming. As more and more villains embraced their evil sides, the demand for expendable henchmen skyrocketed. I started Henchmen for Hire five years ago and built it into a highly profitable operation. 

My assistant handled the initial client screening. If the villain seemed financially stable and likely to avoid immediate defeat by a meddling superhero, I would take the meeting.

The Octopod stopped by to discuss staffing his underwater sea lab. "I need guards to patrol the perimeter of my domed habitat. But normal humans won't suffice given the depth and water pressure. I require amphibious creatures."

"Say no more," I told him. "I have just the solution - merfolk. Half human, half fish, they can monitor your sea lab day and night while breathing comfortably underwater. Disposable and replaceable in the unlikely event of capture or loss."

The Octopod grinned, his metallic tentacles clicking and whirring in delight. "Excellent. I shall hire two dozen to start. Bill me the usual rates."  

After he left, I notified our merfolk wranglers to start recruiting more muscle. The beasts came cheap but tended to have short lifespans in captivity, so a steady stream was needed.

Next on the docket was a meeting with Dr. Precipice, a chemist seeking to poison the city's water supply. She needed a dozen henchmen to fill out her ranks, preferably with scientific backgrounds to assist in her doomsday plans. "Discretion and loyalty are key. I can't have my employees blabbing about my schemes before I poison millions!"

I showed her several candidates with degrees in chemistry, engineering, and environmental sciences. She started cackling with glee as she looked over their files. "This one used to work for the water treatment plant! Oh, he'll do nicely. I'll take them all. This will be my deadliest plan yet!" 

The week's third meeting was with an older villain, Colonel Monstrosity, who had been terrorizing the city since the 60s. But time caught up to everyone, even super villains. "These young punk villains today, with their fancy gadgets and exotic bases, no respect for the basics. I need some classic muscle - you know, big, dumb, carrying obvious weapons. But my arthritis is acting up and I need help just terrorizing the locals." 

I had to stifle a laugh, seeing the once imposing super soldier now hobbled by age. "I have some low-level thugs that would be perfect for your needs. How does a dozen henchmen sound, to help with any physical labor or menacing the populace?"  

"Splendid!" he exclaimed. The colonel regaled me with stories of past villainy for over an hour before I could gently prod him out the door.

At days' end, I reviewed the week's new hires and revenue numbers with satisfaction. Business was booming thanks to villains of all shapes, sizes, ages, and evil desires. And as long as I kept providing quality henchmen to assist them in their nefarious plots, the future looked bright for Henchmen for Hire. Long live villainy!
