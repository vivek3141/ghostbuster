I peered through the scope of my rifle, the crosshairs firmly centered on the silhouette in the distant window. The familiar profile was unmistakable, even at this range. I slowly squeezed the trigger, bracing for the kickback.

The shot rang out, shattering the second story window. There was a moment of stillness, then a flurry of activity around the house as guards rushed about in confusion. My heart raced as I watched, waiting to see the result of my handiwork. 

After a few minutes, two guards emerged, carrying a limp body and loading it into an ambulance. I smiled - the Führer was dead by my hand. I had won this year's contest in dramatic fashion.

The time traveler's game of killing Hitler had become quite popular over the centuries. Points were awarded for factors like the creativity of the method, the difficulty in carrying out the plan, and proximity to key events in history. I had spent decades perfecting my approach, determining the precise date and location to strike for maximum impact.

This was the day before Hitler was originally supposed to die by suicide in his bunker. By killing him a day early in a completely different location and fashion, I ensured high marks for changing history in a clever way. The long distance rifle shot from a hidden position also demonstrated a high degree of skill.

As the ambulance sped off into the night, I dismantled my rifle and retreated from the area. My mission accomplished, I returned to the future to claim my prize. At the awards ceremony, the judges reviewed historical records and footage of my feat. They were clearly impressed with my bold strategy and flawless execution.

When the final scores were announced, I had surpassed all previous records to win by a large margin. As defending champion, the hype for what innovative method I might employ next year began immediately. I smiled, basking in the glory of a game well played. The future was open with possibilities for how I might outdo myself and pull off an even more audacious scheme to kill the Führer once again.
