The dusty old library towered before me, holding untold secrets and stories within its walls. As an aspiring writer, I often visited the library searching for inspiration among the thousands of books. Today felt different though. 

As I walked through the creaky doors, the librarian Mrs. Jenkins greeted me with a smile and her usual “Let me know if you need any help finding something!”  I meandered through the aisles, trailing my fingers along the spins of books until two unassuming books caught my eye on a back shelf. They were small, leather-bound volumes with no titles on their spines. 

I pulled them out and noticed the only markings were a large number “1” on the spine of one and “2” on the other. I opened the first book, number “1”, and began reading with curiosity. The handwritten pages were filled with fantastical tales of adventure, magic and heroism. Stories of brave knights, cunning thieves and grand battles between good and evil. But as I devoured the pages, something felt off. These stories couldn’t possibly be true. They were too outrageous, too over the top to be real. I realized this book must contain fiction - captivating lies and false tales, despite its lack of title or context.

Intrigued, I turned my attention to the second book, hoping it might provide answers. As I opened the cover of book “2”, I was met with a neatly handwritten table of contents. “Marriage Records, 1803-1810” “Criminal Court Proceedings, 1812-1815” “Slave Trade Ship Manifest, 1823”. My heart raced as I realized this second book was filled not with stories, but with facts - births and deaths, trials and tribulations, the unvarnished truths of human history. 

 I gazed in awe at the treasure before me. Two unmarked books, one containing elaborate tales of fiction, the other holding records of truth. Both mysterious in their origin, preserved for years within this library waiting to reveal their secrets. 

I approached the librarian, books in hand, and asked “Mrs. Jenkins, what can you tell me about these two unmarked volumes I found on the back shelf?”  She gazed at the books, inspecting them gently. A smile crept across her face. 

“My, I haven’t seen those books in ages,” she replied. “The library acquired them many years ago as part of a donation. We were never able to identify the original owner or author. We cataloged them as ‘untitled volume one’ and ‘untitled volume two’ due to their missing labels and markings.”

I nodded, understanding dawning on me. “I believe one contains works of fiction and the other documented facts. Do you know which holds which?”  

Mrs. Jenkins chuckled softly. “I do not know for certain as I have not read them myself. That is for you to discover, my dear. But what an delightful mystery you have found - two unnamed books, one hiding lies within its pages, the other revealing truths, both waiting to be explored. I wish you joy in unraveling their secrets!”

With that, I carefully placed the two small books into my bag and walked out of the library, eager to delve into the stories - both real and imagined - held within their covers. All that was left to discern was which volume revealed truth and which held lies. But in a way, does it really matter, as long as the stories move and inspire us? I smiled and opened the first book, prepared to lose myself in the adventures that awaited.
