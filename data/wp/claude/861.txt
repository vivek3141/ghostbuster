The blank page stared back at her, the cursor blinking in a steady rhythm as if to taunt her lack of progress. She knew she wanted to write, felt the urge building up inside her like a tea kettle coming to boil, the ideas and words rushing through her mind. Yet every time she sat down to pour them out, they scattered like drops of mercury, refusing to be contained.  

She thought back to when writing felt easy, when she was a child spinning stories and scribbling poems without a second thought. Where had that unselfconscious creativity gone? Now her inner critic was always looking over her shoulder, judging her word choices and turns of phrase before they even made it onto the page. She wanted her writing to be meaningful, impactful, perfect. The pressure she put on herself made the act of creation feelweighted and joyless.  

In a flash of defiance, she ripped the half-blank page out of her notebook, crumpled it into a ball, and threw it across the room. She took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and stilled her racing thoughts. In the quiet darkness behind her eyelids, she tried to recapture the feeling of childlike play. She visualized her ideas as bubbles floating whimsically through her mind, rather than as butterflies pinned painfully into place. 

When she opened her eyes again, she set her fingers to the keys without overthinking. She wrote without judgment, following the flow of her thoughts and trusting her instincts. The words began to pour out again, at first in fits and starts but then in an unstoppable torrent. Her writing was imperfect and messy and real. But as the cursor continued its march across the screen, she realized with elation that her creativity had come home again. The blank page was no longer staring back at her but was filling up with the overflow from her mind and heart and soul. She was, simply and wondrously, writing.
