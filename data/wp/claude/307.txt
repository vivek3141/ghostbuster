The dark ritual was ready. Billy lit the last black candle, completing the pentagram. His spider tattoos twitching with dark energy, he began the incantation to summon the dread Lord of the Underworld.

As Billy mispronounced the final syllables of the summoning spell, there was a burst of red smoke and a warm, cheerful laugh. "Ho, ho, ho! My, what a surprise!"

A portly man in a red suit with a long white beard stepped out of the smoke, his arms laden with brightly wrapped gifts. "Usually I come down the chimney, but your little ceremony seems to have summoned me instead, my boy!"

Billy stammered, his pale face blanching ghostly white. He had made a terrible mistake. The ancient tome of spells he had stolen from the library and struggled to decipher had been badly misread. His dyslexia had cursed him to challenge one of the mightiest forces of goodness in the universe rather than eternal evil. 

"I...I want to sell my soul..." Billy mumbled, trembling. He had come this far, and couldn't back out now.

"Oh, my dear boy!" Santa exclaimed. "I don't deal in souls. I spread joy and good cheer!" With a wink, he set his heavy gift sack down. "But for summoning me, I suppose I could grant you one special gift, if you promise to turn from these dark paths and walk the road of light."

Billy nodded eagerly. His desire for power and darkness evaporated like smoke in the warmth of Santa's smile. "I promise, sir. And...could you gift me with better vision? My dyslexia makes reading and writing so hard."  

"Consider it done." Santa's eyes twinkled. "Now, about some milk and cookies?"

Billy laughed for the first joyous time in many years. "Of course!" His misread ritual had led to a new beginning. And all he wanted for Christmas was now clear, unblurred sight.
