Jenny gazed up at the night sky, waiting for a shooting star. It was a childhood habit she couldn't shake. When she saw a bright light dart across the sky, she closed her eyes tightly and made a wish. "I wish to fall in love this year," she said softly. 

A few days later, Jenny was surprised to find a letter in her mailbox with no return address. Inside was a typed note:

"Your wish upon a shooting star on the evening of June 12th at 10:42pm local time has been cataloged and assigned case number 119A8463. Unfortunately, what you saw was not an astronomical phenomenon, but rather man-made space debris, likely a decommissioned satellite, burning up upon reentering Earth's atmosphere. 

However, your wish has been recorded and processed. An agent has been assigned to your case to take appropriate measures toward fulfilling your wish to the fall in romantic love within the calendar year. The agent's identity and methods are confidential. We wish you an expedient and fulfilling experience. 

Sincerely, 
Project Starcross"

Jenny blinked in disbelief. It had to be a prank. And yet...something about the tone seemed so official. She shook her head, placing the strange letter into her desk drawer and heading off to work. 

Over the next few months, 'coincidences' began piling up. A blind date with a charming coworker. A chance encounter with an old classmate. Doors opening whenever romantic possibility seemed near. By year's end, Jenny had fallen for a kind-hearted musician she met at a coffee shop. They shared their first kiss under the light of a waning crescent moon. So maybe there are secret agents who make dreams come true, she thought, with a smile as bright as any star.
