The sun rose over the hills surrounding the village. Jenar awoke in his mudbrick hut and said a prayer of thanks to the gods for another day. His village was prosperous, the fields were fertile, and peace reigned in the kingdom. 

As Jenar worked in the barley fields, strange noises came from the forest to the north. Loud crashes and odd booms echoed in the distance. He worried that the northern tribe was attacking again. He had heard stories of their great armies marching with iron and riding beasts of burden. But no attack came.

A week later, Jenar was summoned to the village center. The chieftan announced that the northern king had pledged peace between the tribes. More than that, they offered knowledge of ironworking, farming, and building techniques as a gift. Jenar rejoiced at the news. His village would prosper!

Over the next months, northerners came and built great aqueducts to irrigate the fields, sturdy granaries to store surplus food, and an imposing fortress on the hilltop for defense. The chieftan did not even need to levy taxes for these builds. "We have found knowledge from ancient ruins," the northerners explained. 

Jenar's village swelled with the harvest and new trade. His daughter would never know the hunger or fear from before. But Jenar pondered what ancient knowledge the northerners had really discovered in those strange forests, with the booms and crashes that had so worried him on that fateful morning. He gave thanks to the gods for the prosperity, but also wondered what new powers were really shaping the kingdomâ€™s destiny.
