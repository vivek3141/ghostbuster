The cold water splashed on Mark's face as he leaned over the sink. He reached for the paper towels and patted himself dry, then looked up into the mirror. At first glance, everything seemed normal. But when Mark raised his right hand to brush his hair back, he paused. His reflection was slightly delayed. 

Mark blinked a few times, thinking his eyes were playing tricks on him. But when he moved his hand, his reflection trailed behind by just a fraction of a second. His heart began to race as a chill ran down his spine. He turned around to see if someone was behind him, controlling his reflection as some kind of twisted prank. But the bathroom was empty.

With a shaking hand, Mark reached out and touched the mirror. It felt solid and normal. His own frightened eyes stared back at him, moving in sync with his face. Yet his reflection’s right hand was still slightly behind, like an echo that couldn’t quite keep up.

His mind scrambled for a logical explanation but came up empty. As far as he knew, this wasn’t possible. Reflections were meant to perfectly imitate one’s movements, not lag behind like some glitch in the matrix. 

In a panic, Mark left the bathroom and rushed out of his apartment. His neighbor was just leaving for work, and Mark grabbed his arm, sputtering his strange experience. But when he dragged the man into the bathroom, Mark’s reflection was perfectly normal. His neighbor gave him a concerned look and suggested he needed more sleep.

Mark was left questioning his own sanity and perception of reality. Had the whole experience been some bizarre illusion or trick of the light? He couldn’t make sense of what had happened. The only thing he knew for sure was that for a few terrifying minutes, the man in the mirror was not quite him. His reflection had become unstuck in time, echoing his movements like a badly dubbed video, moments behind yet still close enough to recognize himself in those frightened, confused eyes staring back. Mark shivered at the thought and decided some things were better left unexplained. He avoided looking in mirrors when alone for a long time after that.
