Billy hated doing homework. He was terrible at math and couldn't stand writing essays. One night, as he sat staring at his blank math worksheet, an idea struck him. He had recently read about people summoning demons to do their bidding. Maybe he could summon a demon to do his homework for him!

Billy gathered some candles and a old book of spells he found in his attic. At midnight, he went down to the basement, lit the candles, and began chanting an incantation from the book. At first, nothing happened. But then the basement grew cold and the flames flickered. A sulfurous smell filled the air. There was a loud crack and a creature appeared in a cloud of red smoke. 

The demon was small and spindly, with blood-red skin and horns. "Who dares summon me?" its voice boomed.

Billy's confidence wavered, but he stood up straight. "I did. I want you to do my homework."

The demon laughed, a harsh bellowing sound. "You summoned an eternal being of darkness and evil to do your homework?" 

Billy nodded, holding out his math worksheet with a shaking hand. 

The demon sighed. "Very well, mortal. But know that all magic comes with a price." It snatched the paper from Billy's hand. With a wave of its claw, the paper filled itself out in an elegant cursive script. "There, your homework is done. Now, as payment, I shall take your ability to do mathematics from your mind!"

Before Billy could object, the demon waved its hand again. Billy's mind went blank. He knew his own name and address, but could no longer do addition or subtraction, multiplication or division. 

The demon cackled. "The price is paid. Farewell, mortal!" With another loud crack it vanished in a puff of smoke, leaving behind the acrid smell of brimstone.

Billy looked at the completed math worksheet with a mix of joy and dread. His homework was done, but at what cost? He had gained an easy way out of his homework, but lost something far more valuable. He resolved then and there that while the demon may do his homework tonight, he would find a way to regain what he had lost. He never again summoned the demon, and worked hard from that day on at math. The price had been too high.
