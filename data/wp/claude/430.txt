The darkness enveloped her like a thick blanket. She lay on her side in her bed, her eyes sore from hours of crying. Her heart felt hollowed out, numbness seeping in where there was once joy and warmth.  

A tap at the door. "Come in," she said, her voice a hoarse whisper.  

The door creaked open. Footsteps, so familiar, came closer until she felt the bed sink behind her. A hand on her arm, gently turning her onto her back. Concerned eyes peered into hers in the dim moonlight streaming through the curtains.

"I'm here," he said. That was all he needed to say. 

She started crying again, despair crashing over her in waves. He gathered her into his arms and held her tight as the tears flowed. He didn't try to comfort her with platitudes or empty promises that the pain would lessen. He knew there were no shortcuts through this. He simply stayed with her in the darkness, his embrace a life raft keeping her from drowning in the tumultuous sea of her grief.

After a long time, her sobs quieted. Her eyes were gritty and her head pounded from the exertion. But her breathing steadied as she focused on the warmth of his body next to hers, the steady beat of his heart. She clung to him, and he did not let go.

"I don't know how I'll get through this," she said into his chest.  

He stroked her hair. "I'm here. I'll sit with you in the dark for as long as it takes."

And in that moment, she knew she would make it. Not because someone turned on the light or told her to buck up or look on the bright side. But because she wasn't alone. She had him. And together, they would face whatever came, light or dark. For that unconditional assurance was the flicker of hope she so desperately needed. The glimmer that even the deepest sorrow could not extinguish.
