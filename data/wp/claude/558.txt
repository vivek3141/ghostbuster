The Forgotten 

Jenna opened her eyes and found herself in a familiar yet strange place. It looked like her living room, but the details seemed hazy, as if she was looking at it through a thick fog.

She heard a noise behind her and turned around. It was her husband, Mark, making coffee in the kitchen like he always did. But something felt off about him too. His features lacked definition, like an out-of-focus photograph.  

"Mark?" she said tentatively. He didn't respond. It was as if he couldn't see or hear her.

With a jolt, Jenna remembered. The accident. The hospital. The incessant beeping of the monitors as she slipped away. She was dead—and yet here she still was, in her home, witnessing life go on without her.

Panic rose in Jenna's chest. She ran out the front door but found only a fuzzy, impressionistic version of her neighborhood. Everything looked and felt muffled and indistinct. 

She realized with dawning horror that this must be her afterlife—a shadowy in-between state where she could see the world but not interact with it. And she was doomed to remain here, a forgotten specter, until the last person who remembered her also passed on. 

Jenna thought with longing of her newborn granddaughter, who would never get the chance to know her. She started to fade from this place as her granddaughter grew up with stories but no real memories of the grandmother she never met. With her last thoughts, Jenna hoped that her own memory might live on just a little while longer in the minds of those she left behind. But soon, too soon, there was nothing left of Jenna but a wisp of hope and longing, dissolving into the ether.
