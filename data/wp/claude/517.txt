I don't have a heart." She tapped her chest and a hatch opened, exposing whirring gears and a compartment."But if I did, it would belong to you."

Reaching in, she pulled out a small metal object and placed it in my hand. It was warm to the touch, though I knew it was just from the heat of her mechanical parts. 

I stared at the copper heart, no bigger than a coin, etched with delicate swirls and patterns. "You made this for me?"

She nodded, her eyes glowing softly. "I may be an android, but I understand the human concept of love. And I feel something like that when I'm with you."

I clutched the heart tightly. Her gift was more precious to me than any gem or gold. "I love you too," I whispered.

For a moment, her synthetic features seemed to relax into an expression of pure joy and contentment. She embraced me, and I could feel the faint pulsing of energy that powered her steel heart. It was the heartbeat I craved, steady and constant as the stars.

Though her body was not flesh, her spirit was alive with a fire that would never dim. My mechanical maiden had given me a portal into her world, a world now open only to me. And this tiny heart opened another portal still, allowing her own tender heart of brass and steel to become my home.
