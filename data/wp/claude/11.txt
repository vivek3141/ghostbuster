He sat back in the chair, looking at the monitors behind me. Four of them were mounted a foot below ceiling height, all screens showed employees working. I glimpsed out the window to see the rows of cubicles, all with short walls so that the owner of this CPA firm could watch the employees constantly.  

I shifted uncomfortably under the gaze of the owner, Mr. Thompkins. He had called me into his office for my six-month review, but so far all he had done was stare at the security feeds from around the office. I had been working as a tax accountant at Thompkins CPA for a year now, working long hours during tax season for little pay and even less appreciation. The cubicles and constant monitoring made everyone feel like they were always on edge.

"So, Miss Wilson, how do you think you have performed so far this year?" Mr. Thompkins eyes were still glued to the screens. I cleared my throat.

"I believe I have exceeded expectations in all my assigned tasks. I completed 15% more returns this season compared to last year and achieved an accuracy rate of over 98% with no major errors found so far."  It was a solid performance and I sat up straighter, hoping he would finally look me in the eye.

He made a noncommittal noise but said nothing else. The feeds on the left monitor showed two employees talking while entering data. "Stevens! Martin! Less chatting more working!" he barked into the intercom. The employees jumped and quickly turned back to their computers. He finally turned to me. 

"Miss Wilson, while you have been...competent, I expect nothing less than excellence from my employees. Your raise will be 0.5% this year. Dismissed." My jaw dropped open but he had already turned back to the monitors. I shook with anger and frustration but said nothing as I left the office, his gaze following me out on the security feeds. Working at Thompkins CPA was unbearable, and as I returned to my cubicle, I made up my mind to hand in my notice. No paycheck was worth this kind of treatment. Freedom and respect were more valuable, and I would find an employer who actually recognized hard work when he saw it.
