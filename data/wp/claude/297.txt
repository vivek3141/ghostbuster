The Mistake 

Jenny saw the Facebook post and her heart sank. Mark, her ex from over a decade ago, had been in a terrible car accident. The post from his sister said he was in the hospital in critical condition.

Jenny's finger hovered over the "Like" button but she couldn't bring herself to click it. Would that seem strange, after all these years of no contact? They had a messy breakup in college and lost touch completely. 

And yet, in quiet moments over the years, her thoughts had sometimes drifted to Mark. Their young love had been passionate and all-consuming. Mark was her first real love, and a small part of her would always care for him.

Jenny scrolled through the comments, many from people she used to know. She read updates from Mark's family and friends, learning the extent of his injuries. Tears sprang to her eyes. She wished there was something she could do. She felt helpless and adrift in memories of the past. 

Her husband Ben came into the room, asking if she wanted to go out for dinner. She wiped her eyes quickly and closed her laptop. 

"Is everything okay?" Ben asked. 

Jenny forced a smile. "I'm fine. Just had something in my eye."

She knew she couldn't explain this to Ben. He had never been jealous of her past, but Mark represented a part of her life that was long gone. She couldn't dredge all that up now without causing hurt and confusion. 

All through dinner, Jenny's mind was elsewhere. She said a silent prayer for Mark, hoping he would recover and find happiness again. She realized with sadness that she would never know how this chapter ended. They had turned the page on each other, for better or worse, and there was no going back. Their lives had diverged, mistakes and all, into the stuff of memory. All she could do was wish him well from afar.
