The first time it happened, Maria thought it was just déjà vu. She was sitting in her daily morning meeting at work, listening to her boss drone on about quarterly goals, when an image flashed in her mind of her co-worker Mark finishing her sentence. And a second later, he did. 

Maria brushed it off as coincidence, but then it kept happening. When she was grabbing coffee in the break room, she had a sudden vision of Mark walking in. Ten seconds later, he appeared. During lunch, an imagined conversation with him popped into her head. That afternoon, the exact same exchange played out in real life.

At first, Maria told herself she was just highly intuitive where Mark was concerned. They had been flirting harmlessly for months, and she paid close attention to his habits and expressions. But soon, their shared moments felt too specific to be explained away so easily. One evening, Maria had a detailed glimpse of Mark in his kitchen, stirring pasta sauce on his stove, and the mental picture was accompanied by the aroma of basil and oregano. The next day, Mark described making that exact pasta dinner.  

Maria started tracking the incidents, looking for a pattern. The projections seemed to come on days when she and Mark shared moments of emotional intimacy, however small. A heartfelt compliment from him, a sly inside joke between them. Whenever one of these poignant connections occurred, her mind opened to his in flashes.

At night, Maria lay in bed consumed with the possibility of what it could mean. Soulmates were the stuff of fantasy, but what else could explain such a profound link between two people? She wondered if Mark was sensing her in return. She was afraid to ask him outright, worried he might think she was crazy. And yet, her heart swelled at the thought they might share this mysterious bond.

One evening, Maria was overwhelmed by a vision of Mark turning onto her street. The image was hazy but persisted, and on an impulse, she went to her window just as Mark pulled up in front of her building, looking distraught. She buzzed him in immediately.

“I knew you were coming,” she told him as she opened her door. “I keep having these glimpses of you, these projected visions of what you're doing or what you're about to do.”  

Mark peered at her in amazement. “Me too,” he said. “Just now, I had this sudden flash of you waiting at your window as I came down the street. That's why I drove over. I had to see you.”

Maria's heart flooded with understanding and relief. She smiled at Mark, filled with wonder at the connection they shared, and she sensed the beginning of their future stretching before them, radiant with the promise of more discoveries to come.
