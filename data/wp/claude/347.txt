The sun filtered through the emerald canopy as I made my way to the clearing. My heart raced at the thought of seeing her again. Eve. The most beautiful creature in all of paradise.

When I entered the clearing, there she was, gathering ripe oranges from the big tree containing all manner of delicious fruit. She smiled when she saw me. Her hair cascaded over her shoulders as she tilted her head. But my joy turned sour when I noticed that scrawny excuse for a man, Adam, skulking behind the tree. He placed his grimy hand over hers, claiming her as his own. 

No. I would not stand to see my heart's desire in the clutches of another. I stomped over to the pair, my chest puffed out. 

"Adam, you worm," I bellowed. "I am here to challenge you for the hand of this fair maiden. Eve shall not go to a weak and spineless fool like yourself."

Adam's eyes grew wide, but he put on a show of bravado. "Begone from here, knave, lest you face my wrath." His voiced trembled as he spoke.

Eve looked at me with surprise and...hope? My confidence swelled.

"I propose a contest of strength and skill," I declared. "Whichever of us proves himself the better specimen shall win the hand of Eve." 

Adam sputtered in protest but Eve silenced him with a glare. "I accept the challenge on Adam's behalf," she said coolly. My heart skipped at beat at her commanding tone. 

And so the challenges began. First, a contest of rock lifting, which I easily won by hoisting boulders thrice the size of Adam's greatest effort. Then a footrace, which I concluded lengths ahead of Adam, barely out of breath. Finally, a test of knowledge about the secrets of the garden, at which I waxed poetic for hours while Adam stammered and stumbled over the simplest of questions.

The sun dipped low in the sky by the time all challenges were met. I had emerged victorious. Adam skulked off into the brush, whimpering in defeat.

I turned to Eve. At last, I had won her hand. But she smiled at me sadly.

"I thank you for rescuing me from Adam's clutches today," she said. "But I cannot go with you. This garden has only enough to support two inhabitants, hand-chosen by the Creator to tend to this place. I was made for Adam, as he was made for me."

My heart shattered into more pieces than I could count. I had won the battle but lost the war. Eve was never meant to be mine. I nodded solemnly, turned, and made my way out of the clearing, alone.
