You and your wife decide to try a new Christmas tradition for the kids called Elf On The Shelf. After a week of you and your wife playing and moving the elf around, you start to notice the elf moves to different places at night by itself. You ask the kids if they been moving it, they say no.  

It started as a fun new holiday game for the kids. You bought an Elf on the Shelf doll and told your children that the elf would fly back to the North Pole each night to report to Santa if they had been naughty or nice. Each morning, the elf would return and land in a new spot in the house for the kids to find. The kids were delighted and named the elf “Buddy.”

For the first week, you and your wife took turns carefully positioning Buddy each night in a whimsical new pose and location. Buddy hung from the ceiling fan, sat in a mixing bowl, read a tiny book. The kids would squeal with laughter each morning upon discovering Buddy's new spot.  

Then one night, you both forgot to move Buddy. In the morning, you realized your mistake and feared the kids would be disappointed that Buddy did not make a magical move during the night. But when you went downstairs, Buddy was posed on top of the refrigerator, arm raised with a tiny candy cane in hand.  

You and your wife exchanged startled looks. “Did you move him?” you asked. She shook her head, eyes wide. The kids bounced into the kitchen and spotted Buddy. “Look, he's doing a little dance on top of the fridge!” they laughed. 

Over the next few nights, you purposely did not move Buddy. Yet each morning, you'd find him in a new, whimsical pose. He hung upside down from the mantle, rode the dog, drove the miniature Christmas train. The kids were overjoyed at Buddy's antics but you and your wife grew increasingly unsettled. 

One night, you set up a camera to record what was happening while you slept. The next morning, you anxiously watched the footage. What you saw sent a chill down your spine. At midnight, Buddy's tiny felt legs swung over the shelf edge. He stood, stretched, and took a few steps before launching himself off the shelf. But instead of tumbling to the ground, he gently floated and glided through the air, landing on the mantle - where you later found him perched next to the clock.  

You stared at your wife in shock and dismay. The Christmas tradition had taken an unsettling turn, as your household was now hosting its own real magical - and airborne - elf on the shelf. The End.
