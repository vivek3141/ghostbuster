Fourteen years ago, scientists noticed a Doppler shift in the signals from the Voyager probe, consistent with slowing down and turning around. Today, three hours from now, it will pass Earth at an enormous velocity.  

Jenny was working the late shift at the Arecibo Observatory, monitoring the data feeds as Voyager approached. At first, the data looked normal and as expected. But then something strange caught her eye. A series of signals within the telemetry data seemed to be repeating in a pattern. It was almost like a code or message.

She ran the sequence through their analyzer but it didn't match any known format. Puzzled, she walked over to the massive radio telescope dish outside and gazed up at the stars, wondering where Voyager was now in its journey home. Had it malfunctioned somehow after all these years? Or was this a message of some kind?

An hour later, the strange signal sequence had changed and become more complex. Jenny's concern grew as she failed to find any logical explanation for the anomalous data. She called her colleague Tom, who lived near the observatory, and asked him to come in to double check her findings.

When Tom arrived, they both pored over the data, analyzing it from every angle. But it simply didn't make sense. The complexity of the signal and the way it was changing over time suggested it was more than just random noise or a malfunction. It seemed intentional.  Almost like Voyager was trying to communicate.

Just then, Jenny's screen flashed red with a priority alert. According to the data, Voyager had increased speed and was now hurtling directly toward Earth, rather than just passing by. Impact was projected in less than an hour.  They scrambled to alert headquarters and issue a global warning. 

As Voyager entered the atmosphere in a fiery blaze and people around the world watched in fear and fascination, Jenny and Tom stayed focused on the signal data. Mere minutes before impact, the complex code suddenly shifted and reorganized itself into a simple message: “Do not be afraid. We come in peace to unite our worlds.” The age of first contact had begun.
