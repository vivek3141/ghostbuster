I woke with a start. Something felt different, like a surge of energy coursing through my body. As I opened my eyes, two words popped into my mind: Call and Seal.

Call and Seal? What did that mean? I sat up in bed, staring at my hands. They looked ordinary, but I had a strange sense that power lay just beneath the surface. An urge came over me to raise one hand and call out into the air. I did so, unsure of what might happen. "Come," I said.  

To my shock, a cup of pens and pencils on my desk flew into my open palm. I almost dropped them in surprise. I had summoned them with just a word and gesture. My heart raced as I realized the implications. I could call objects to me like some kind of telekinetic magnet.

The other word, Seal, tugged at my mind. I focused on the pencils in my hand and said "Seal." They fused together into a single, solid mass. I now grasped a pencil of pencils, melded together seamlessly. My breath caught in my throat. I could unite objects by sealing them, combining them into a whole.

These fantastic powers seemed unreal, yet here was the evidence in my hands. How did I acquire such abilities? A freak accident? A mutagenic change? It didn't seem to matter. I now possessed a potent call and an indissoluble seal. 

A giddy laugh escaped my lips as I imagined the possibilities. No more searching for lost itemsâ€”I could call them to me in an instant. I could combine and transform materials, crafting new objects limited only by my imagination. The practical and creative applications were endless.

My revelry was cut short by a knock at the door. I stashed my pencil creation under the bed and took a deep breath. So much had changed, yet the outside world remained oblivious. How would I learn to control and use these new talents? And should I share them with others, or keep my strange gifts a closely guarded secret? I rose slowly and went to open the door, stepping into a world filled with uncertainty yet rife with potential. My life as I knew it would never be the same. The end.
