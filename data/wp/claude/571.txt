The Angel of Death surveyed the scorched landscape below him, his great black wings extended to their full span. The familiar pull to harvest souls was gone today. There were no souls left to claim in this place, no spirits to transition to the afterlife. They had all been extinguished in an instant of blinding light and furious heat.

He had witnessed the flashpoints of the first explosions blossoming across the horizon, seen the mushroom clouds billowing up as once great cities were reduced to ashes. He had watched as the shockwaves rippled out, bringing fire and destruction to all they touched. There was no discrimination in the bombs' effectsâ€”they consumed everything and everyone with an equal and terrible fury.

Now silence hung over the wasteland. The fires had largely burned themselves out, with nothing left to fuel them. No birds sang. No dogs barked. There were no screams or cries of pain and terror to be heard. Just an eerie, desolate silence.

The Angel knew his role today was not one of harvest but of witness. He must survey the totality of the devastation and bear eternal testimony to this monstrous act of self-immolation. He dipped lower to see vehicles melted into lumps of metal, trees burned into charred and jagged stumps. The remains of buildings stuck out of the smoldering debris like broken fingers clawing at the sky. How many souls had these structures sheltered just a day before? How many lives had crossed paths on this very spot mere hours ago? All gone now, as if they had never been.

A profound sadness threatened to break the Angel's ageless and impassive countenance. After so many millennia ferrying souls into the light, the scale of this atrocity momentarily shook even his celestial equilibrium. But his duty was to observe and remember. And so he watched, and he remembered, as the fires burned out and the world fell into twilight. The light had gone out of this place, perhaps never again to return. The Angel lingered long over the ruins, a solitary witness, before unfolding his great wings and taking flight into the gathering night, leaving behind a world made newly and terribly silent.
