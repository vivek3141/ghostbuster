The old temple stood atop the mountain, as it had for centuries untold. Stone walls rose up towards the sky, weathered yet still sturdy, decorated with intricate carvings that told the stories of the god Xythun and his mighty deeds. Once, many worshippers made the treacherous pilgrimage up the narrow mountain pass to pray within the hallowed halls of the temple and offer sacrifices of grain and livestock upon the bloodied altar.   

Now, the temple was quiet and empty. The followers of Xythun had long since dwindled and died out, their faith forgotten. The mountain path was overgrown, the temple abandoned. The bloodied altar had not received a sacrifice in living memory. Yet Xythun endured, as he always hadâ€”the eternal, undying god, bound within the temple that had been built to honor his name an age ago.

Or so it was believed. The old stories held that Xythun's life force was tied eternally to his temple, as long as its stones still stood. If the temple should fall, Xythun would fall with it. Most dismissed this as mere myth and folklore, not to be taken seriously.

Most. Not all.   

In a small village at the base of the mountain, there lived a young girl named Myra. She knew the old stories well and believed them with all her heart. The other villagers thought her strange and fanciful, a dreamer of foolish dreams. Myra did not mind. She knew what she knew.

And she knew that Xythun had to die.   

At night, she often dreamt of the darkened hallways of the temple and heard the anguished cries of those sacrificed to Xythun echoing through the ages. Though the sacrifices had stopped long ago, the temple walls were soaked in old blood and suffering. As long as Xythun lived, Myra believed the cries of the dead would not rest. The god of the temple atop the mountain had to fall.

So Myra made her plan. She gathered supplies in secret, a little at a time so as not to raise suspicion. A length of rope. A bundle of dried brambles. A knife. Flint and tinder. Oil. She hid these in a sack and set off one moonless night, making her way up the overgrown mountain path with grim determination.

By the time she reached the temple, her hands were cut and bleeding, her breath coming in gasps. Yet her resolve was undimmed. She entered the musty temple and saw the bloodied altar, the carvings of Xythun's triumphs staring down in the darkness. The anguished cries echoed in her ears, louder than ever before.  

Myra spilled the oil across the ancient stone floor and altar, soaking into the cracks and crevices. She laid out the brambles and rope, then used her knife to spark a flame from the flint and touch fire to the oil-soaked tinder.  

The fire sprang up, hungry, devouring the oil and racing across the temple floor. Myra fled, the angry roar of the flames pursuing her down the mountain even as the first cries of alarm rose from the village below. 

By the time the villagers saw the glow atop the mountain and climbed up to investigate, it was too late. The temple was engulfed, the stones that had stood for untold ages beginning to crumble and fall. A pillar collapsed with a crash, sending up a shower of sparks.

As the temple fell into ruin, there rose an unearthly howl that chilled the bones of all who heard it. The very mountain seemed to tremble with a roar of agony and loss.

Down in the village, Myra watched the blaze in the distance. And though the other villagers gazed on in horror, she smiled. She had done what she had set out to do.

The temple had fallen. Xythun was dead. The cries of anguish had finally been silenced.
