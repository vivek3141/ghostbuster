As we stood there, staring up at the moon, a giant crack appeared. So big, it was visible to the naked eye.

Jenny gasped. "Did you see that? A crack just formed across the surface of the moon!"

I nodded, stunned into silence. We had come out to the lake to stargaze and enjoy the bright full moon. But neither of us expected to witness such an event. 

The crack was jagged and ran almost the entire width of the visible moon. As we watched, transfixed, more cracks began to spiderweb out from the original fracture. Within minutes, the moon's surface looked as if it had shattered like glass.

Jenny gripped my arm tightly. "What's happening? Is the moon breaking apart?" 

I shook my head, bewildered. "I don't know. I've never seen or heard of anything like this before." My mind raced, trying to find a rational explanation. But none came to mind. This seemed impossible. 

The cracks continued to multiply until the moon's surface was nearly obscured. Thin slivers of light shone through, giving the impression of a dim, misshapen moon.

Then, a chunk of the moon detached and drifted away. And another. Soon, large fragments were floating off into space, while smaller shards and dust cascaded down in an eerie lunar avalanche. 

Jenny began to cry. I put my arm around her, as much to comfort myself as her. We were witnessing a cataclysmic event that should not be possible. Yet here it was unfolding before our disbelieving eyes.

Within an hour, the moon had shattered into a loose debris field, with only its core remaining intact. A pale orb now shone where once the proud full moon had dominated the night sky. 

We sat in stunned silence for a long time, clinging to one another as we gazed at the remains of Earth's faithful companion. Our world felt unmoored, set adrift without the steady rhythm of the moon's phases.  What new peril might this abrupt change portend? The familiar had been forever altered in a heartbeat.

At last I said, "We need to tell someone. Report what we saw." I fumbled to activate my phone's camera, cursing the poor nighttime quality as I captured the new moon and its attending sea of fragments. 

Jenny wiped at her tears, a tremor in her voice. "Will anyone even believe us? We hardly believe it ourselves."

She had a point. If I hadn't witnessed the moon's destruction myself, I would not have thought it credible. Yet here was the devastating proof, recorded on my phone for all to see.

I helped Jenny to her feet. "Only one way to find out." We had a story to tell, implausible yet true. The moon had cracked and crumbled before our eyes, and nothing in our world would ever look the same again.
