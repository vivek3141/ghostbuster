The ruins of Paris smoldered around them as the three soldiers picked their way down the abandoned street. The final days of World War 3 had been long and brutal, and Private Martin was beginning to doubt they would make it out of the city alive.

As they turned a corner, Corporal Stevens held up a fist, signaling them to stop. He peered around a crumbled wall, then waved them over excitedly.

"You've got to see this," he whispered. Martin and Private Singh moved up beside him. There, on the ground of what used to be a tiny cafe, was a crushed cardboard pack of cigarettes, still wrapped in cellophane. Singh gasped.

Even before the war, cigarettes had been rare and valuable. But after a decade of conflict, tobacco was near mythical, only rumored to exist somewhere far from the bombed-out streets of Europe. None of the three soldiers, all in their early 20s, had ever seen a real cigarette.

"Should we open it?" asked Martin, his voice trembling at the prospect. 

"There are probably only a couple left intact," said Corporal Stevens. "We'll have to split them." The others nodded solemnly, realizing the momentous occasion called for sharing. 

Stevens gently tore away the cellophane and opened the pack. "Three left! A miracle." He handed Martin and Singh each a slightly bent cigarette, then took the final one for himself. 

Martin inspected the white cylinder in his hand. It smelled faintly sweet. Hesitantly, he put it between his lips, the way he'd seen his elders do as a child, a lifetime ago. He watched as Singh flicked a lighter to life, its flame dancing in the gloom. When the tip of Martin's cigarette glowed red, he inhaled.

The smoke filled his mouth and lungs, and the heady tobacco hit his bloodstream. His limbs tingled, and his vision swam momentarily. It was the best he'd felt in years.

They smoked in silence, savoring each hit, the nicotine rush reminding them all too well of years lost. As the final embers faded, Singh muttered, "That was bloody perfect. I'd go through it all again for another drag of that." Martin and Stevens voiced somber agreement.

Too soon, their break was over. The sounds of distant artillery fire snapped them back to the present. The battle wasn't finished yet. But for a few minutes, in the company of old comrades and older tobacco, the war hadn't seemed to matter at all. They had recaptured a bit of the lives taken from them. Together, they would fight on to reclaim the rest, one battle at a time.
