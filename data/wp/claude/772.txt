The diner was dusty, just like the rest of the one-horse town. I slid into a booth and ordered a coffee, black, and pancakes. The waitress poured and walked away, chewing gum and not saying a word. 

I looked out the window at the empty street. Two pickup trucks rolled by, then nothing. The hot desert sun beat down, scorching the cracked asphalt and baking the faded brick buildings. Everything felt worn and weary, drained of life. A tumbleweed tangled in the crooked fence across the street, the only thing moving.

The pancakes arrived, drowned in syrup. I ate methodically, not tasting anything. My mind was already hundreds of miles west, imagining the crashing waves and seabirds of the coast. This town was just an inconvenience, a rest stop on the long drive to something better.

A bell dinged as a couple walked in, breaking the stillness. They took a booth, nodding at the waitress, familiar. Locals. They laughed loudly at some shared joke, and for a moment I envied their familiarity with this place. But then I thought of the road ahead, open and unknown and filled with promise. 

I paid the bill and left, crumpling a couple of dollars as a tip. The waitress took the money silently, not even a nod of thanks. But I didnâ€™t blame her. I knew her life here, each day fading into the next, a grey sense of disappointment and dreams long gone. 

A roar of life burst from my engine as I turned the key, music blaring. I smiled, feeling the vibration in my bones. The road before me led out of this town and into wild possibilities. The rearview mirror held nothing but a speck that grew smaller and smaller, a town that was never more than a place you stopped on your way somewhere else. On to the next stop, the next start, the reinvention waiting just around the bend. My tires churned up dust as I drove toward the horizon and into the blazing sun.
