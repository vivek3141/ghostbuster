The day started out normal enough. I woke up, had my coffee, and commuted into the office. But on the freeway into the city center, strange things started happening. Cars started levitating, people were teleporting, objects were moving with just a glance. It soon became clear that almost everyone had developed some kind of superhuman ability overnight. 

When I got into the office, my co-workers were buzzing. "I have super speed!" said Mark, zipping from his desk to the break room and back in the blink of an eye. 

"Check this out," said Jenny, concentrating for a moment before shapeshifting into a perfect duplicate of our boss. We all laughed at the impression. People were discovering and showing off all kinds of powers.

At lunch, a group of us were chatting about our new abilities. I stayed quiet, not wanting to reveal that I seemed to have been left out of this new phenomenon.

"What about you?" asked Jenny. "What's your power?"

I hesitated, not wanting to admit I didn't have one. "Oh, nothing too exciting," I said. "Minor telekinesis, moving small objects. What about you, Mark?" I deflected the attention away from myself.

"Super speed, like I showed earlier. I can break the sound barrier if I want to!" said Mark.

The conversation moved on and I breathed a sigh of relief that my lie had worked. The truth was, I did have an ability. But it wasn't minor or unexciting. When I had woken up this morning, I had discovered I could generate and manipulate electricity. At first, I had reveled in it, feeling the power surging at my fingertips. But soon I realized how dangerous it was. I had made the lights flicker just by thinking about it. If I lost control for even a moment, I could hurt someone. So I kept it a secret.

As my co-workers showed off, using their new abilities openly and recklessly, I stayed quiet. I knew that with great power came great responsibility. My ability was terrifying, and I loved it, but I also feared it. So I kept my secret, and watched with a mix of wonder and apprehension as the world around me changed in the blink of an eye. My power would remain my burden alone to bear.
