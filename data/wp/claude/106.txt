The Songs of the Heart 

The music was always there, as long as I could remember. Not audible sounds, but impressions, feelings—the essence of a song emanating from each person I encountered. A melody, tempo, and rhythm uniquely their own. A song of the heart that revealed a glimpse into their true self.

I never told anyone about the songs. How could I explain something so strange, something I barely understood myself? So I kept quiet, and over the years grew accustomed to the unheard melodies that surrounded me, and what they could reveal about a person.

The cheerful soprano of the bakery lady whose kind eyes and warm smile matched the brightness of her song. The plodding, off-key dirge of my algebra teacher, a discordant tempo to match his dull and bitter nature. The lively, syncopated jazz of my best friend Jess, full of humor, chaos, and heart. The songs told me who people really were at their core when all pretense and façade fell away. 

Until the day I met the woman with no song. 

It was at the coffee shop, in the line to order. When I looked at the woman in front of me, I was met with silence. An absence where there should have been...something. It was as if a television had been left on with the volume muted. I felt the static and blank space where her song should have played. 
Unsettled, I glanced away, then back again, wondering if my strange ability had simply shorted out for a moment. But no—as my gaze returned to her, the silence remained. Nothing emanated from this woman. No melody, no rhythm, no notes. Just a blank void and shapeless static.

Who was she? What did it mean that she had no song? I had come to rely on these auditory clues my whole life, using them to navigate relationships and understand people. Yet here was someone I couldn’t read. A woman who did not broadcast the usual hints about her character, spirit, and soul.

She paid for her coffee and walked to a table by the window. I found myself following her with my eyes, curiosity mingled with wariness. When she noticed my gaze, I quickly looked away, embarrassed at being caught staring. I expected to feel her eyes on me, reciprocating my unwanted attention, but when I dared another glance she was looking out the window, lost in her own thoughts, seemingly oblivious to everything around her.  

Including me. And in that moment I realized that is exactly what made me so unsettled in her presence. She was oblivious to everything around her. Her songlessness meant she lacked that subtle connection we all share with each other, that subconscious awareness of the humanity we have in common but so rarely acknowledge. Without that, there was only indifference. And indifference unnerved me more than any discordant melody ever could.  

Because a song of the heart, no matter how jarring, at least meant there was a heart to see. A heart to connect with. The lack of any song meant the absence of that heart, or that connection, and this strange woman remained locked alone in her own world of static behind an impenetrable veil. Closed off from the symphony of life that gives each day its meaning.

I left the coffee shop shaken, haunted by the void where her song should have been. Haunted by its inscrutable warning: while a song of the heart reveals us, the lack of one may hide more than we can ever truly understand about another. Or perhaps what it hides is something missing within ourselves—that ability to make that profound and wordless connection. A connection that gives rise to the songs in the first place.
