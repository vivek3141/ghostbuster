The dead lay everywhere. In the streets, in homes, behind the wheels of crashed vehicles. Bob walked the eerily empty city in a daze, searching for other survivors. He found others but they were few and far between -just 10% of the world's population remained. In the following weeks, they found each other and formed small communities that organized to deal with the challenges of living in a world built for billions with only a fraction remaining. 

As Bob met other survivors, he was struck by a peculiar realization. These people came from all over the world and all walks of life, yet they shared something in common besides their survival. They were all introverts. Not shy or antisocial, but people who gained energy from solitude and lost it in noise and crowds. 

He met Mary, a teacher from Ireland, who confessed she always struggled to connect with large groups of students. He met Chen, a sculptor from China, who spent months alone carving wood in his studio. He met Miguel, a writer from Chile, who worked alone for days crafting his stories. 

Bob himself was an accountant who felt drained by the forced social interaction of office life and regained energy in the quiet of his home. None of them would have imagined for this to be the trait that determined who lived and died. The extroverts had gathered in crowds in those final hours of panic and peripherally exposed each other to the virus, while the introverts had isolated themselves, unintentionally inoculating themselves from the outbreak.

A sliver of humanity remained, united not by a common language, religion or homeland, but by the shared personality of those accustomed to living comfortably in solitude and quiet. From the ruins of a civilization built by extroverts, the introverts set about building their own society. A society build around respect for personal space, limited social interaction and freedom from constant stimulation. Bob smiled at the irony that for once, the introverts had inherited the Earth.
