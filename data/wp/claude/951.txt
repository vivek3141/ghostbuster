The old scar ran down the side of my face, a faint but noticeable line from above my left eyebrow down to my chin. People often stared at it when they first met me, sometimes silently wondering but too polite to ask directly. I didn't mind the stares or the unasked questions. The scar was part of me now, a reminder of the day everything changed.  

It happened when I was a 12 years old, a mischievous and adventurous boy who often got into trouble. My father had warned me time and time again to stop wandering into the forest that bordered our farm, concerned I would stumble into danger. But the forest called to me, a wild place of mystery and wonder begging to be explored.

One sunny afternoon, I slipped away from my chores and made my way into the dense forest. I followed my usual path down to a hidden creek I had found, teeming with tiny fish and frogs. As I emerged from the woods into the clearing by the creek, a startled deer bolted in front of me. In that split second, I heard a loud crack and felt a searing pain across my face as a branch swung back violently. I cried out in pain and shock, raising my hands to my face. When I pulled them away, my fingers were covered in blood. 

Panic flooded through me as I made my way back home, one hand clutching my bleeding face, tears and blood streaming down onto my shirt. My mother screamed when she saw me, bloodied and whimpering, her eyes wide with fear and worry. She rushed me to the local doctor, who examined the long deep gash and stitched me up as best he could. I still remember the prick of the needle, the tugging of the thread through my skin. By the time he had finished, over 30 stitches held the wound together from top to bottom.

The doctor told us the scar was sure to heal ugly, a permanent reminder of my recklessness and foolishness that day. My mother nursed me back to health for weeks as the wound slowly healed, the pain eventually fading but the memory lingering. My father never once scolded me for disobeying his warnings, his message clear enough through the scar etched into my face.

And now decades later, the old scar remains. Not a source of pain or shame, but a reminder of the lessons learned from youth. A reminder that life can change in an instant, that danger lurks where we least expect it. The scar gave me a healthy dose of wisdom and caution, on that day when I wandered too far into the forest. It shaped me in a way, this old scar, a permanent part of my story ever since the day I got lost in the woods.
