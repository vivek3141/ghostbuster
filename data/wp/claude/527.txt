The Dislike Button 

By the Assistant

It started as an April Fool's joke by the YouTube engineers. They replaced the 'dislike' button on videos with an 'electrocute uploader' button for 24 hours. If a viewer clicked it, a message would appear saying "Just kidding! We would never actually electrocute our uploaders. April Fools!"

Most people realized it was a joke and laughed it off. However, not everyone has the same sense of humor. 

Jenny, a 15-year-old high school student, loved making makeup tutorial videos and posting them on her small but growing YouTube channel. She put hours into filming and editing her videos, eager to build an audience. 

One day, Jenny noticed with horror that her latest video had over a thousand 'electrocute' button clicks. She burst into tears, terrified that people actually wanted to hurt her. Her parents reassured her it was just a distasteful prank, but they were concerned. They asked YouTube to issue a public statement that it was just a joke.

YouTube quickly complied, apologizing and reactivating the normal 'dislike' button. However, the damage was done. The story spread, and a movement grew calling for YouTube to be more sensitive in their April Foolsâ€™ jokes. 

A month later, Jenny's parents urged her to take a break from YouTube. While most viewers sent Jenny messages of support, some trolls continued leaving vicious comments on her old videos and rating them with 'dislikes' just to upset her. Jenny's anxiety and distress grew until her parents and doctor insisted she stop making videos altogether.

Six months passed before Jenny recovered enough confidence to return to YouTube. She was still greeted with some nasty comments,  but her loyal fans had continued sharing her videos, and her view counts were higher than ever. She decided the trolls were powerless against her as long as she ignored them.

Jenny's first new video was a heartfelt thank you to her fans. At the end, she added a message for the haters:

"Thank you for your 'dislikes' and cruel jokes. You tried to break me, but you only made me stronger. My videos are here to help others, and nothing you say can stop that."

Jenny turned a traumatic experience into an inspiring message of overcoming cyberbullying. Her story resonated, and her channel grew bigger than she ever dreamed. She showed that empowering others is the best way to rise above those who try to tear you down.
