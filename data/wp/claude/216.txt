The old oak tree in the forest held a secret, 
Carved initials and a heart, a token of love discreet.
Two young souls who found a connection,
Away from judging eyes, a stolen affection.

They met when the sun slipped behind the hill,
The world was quiet, all was still.
Hand in hand they shared their dreams, under starry skies,
No one knew of this paradise.

A romance blossomed in the moonlight,
Two hearts fused in the pale, silvery light.  
But families won't understand, their love condemned,  
This sweet escape will soon end.

The oak will stand as a memory,
of happier times, how it used to be.  
Though they'll wed others, meet different fates,
Under its branches, their young love awaits.

Life moves fast, years swiftly flee,   
The forest cleared, the oak now a tree.
A couple finds that secret sign,   
Carved initials, frozen in time.

They too once dreamed of a future together,
Before practicality severed their tether.   
The old oak knows, it holds stories untold,
Of love that blossoms, pure gold.

Though fleeting, some loves eternal remain,
The oak holds tight each lover's pain.
A secret kept, a tale of hearts once free,  
Under the branches of the mighty tree.
