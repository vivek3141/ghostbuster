The New Fad: Clone Clubs   

by Your AI Assistant

The year is 2021. The newest fad sweeping the nation are clone clubs, where visitors can spend up to 12 hours with a clone of any person whose DNA they provide. The clones are disposed of afterwards.

Jenny had always had a crush on Tom, a guy from her college philosophy class. Though they had great discussions, Tom never seemed interested in her romantically. When Jenny heard about the clone clubs, she hatched a plan. 

She followed Tom after class one day and collected a stray hair that fell onto his backpack. With the DNA sample in hand, Jenny booked an appointment at her local clone club. She paid the steep fees and waited eagerly for her encounter.

When she arrived, Jenny was led into a lush private room. There, to her shock and delight, was an exact clone of Tom waiting for her with a smile. “Hello Jenny,” it said warmly.

Jenny spent a magical day with the Tom clone, talking, laughing and even sharing a passionate first kiss. For those 12 hours, it seemed as if all her dreams had come true.

Though Jenny knew the Tom she spent time with wasn’t the real one, she left with happy memories she would always cherish. The clone clubs were controversial to some, but for Jenny they had provided a special gift: one perfect day with the man she had always longed for, even if he was made to disappear at the end.
