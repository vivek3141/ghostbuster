The Trip to Feudal Japan  

I couldn't believe my time machine worked. One minute I was in my garage in 2020, the next I was in a bamboo forest in feudal Japan. As an 80's kid, I grew up obsessed with ninjas. I had to know if the movies and shows of my childhood were accurate. 

Night fell and I crept through the forest, hiding in the shadows. In the distance, I saw a small village. Outside one hut, two figures emerged, clad in black. Ninjas! They crept with a speed and silence that seemed almost supernatural. My childhood imagination hadn't done them justice.

I followed them to a castle, its high stone walls ominously lit by the moon. The ninjas scaled the walls effortlessly and leapt over the parapets. This was better than any action sequence in the movies. I found handholds in the rock and struggled my way up, finally lifting myself over the wall. 

In the courtyard, three guards stood watch. The ninjas appeared behind them like ghosts. Before the guards knew they were there, the ninjas struck, felling them silently. They dragged the bodies into the shadows. My sneaker scraped on the stone and one ninja whipped around, hurling a razor-sharp shuriken in my direction. I ducked just in time. The ninja spotted me and pulled a menacing-looking ninjatō sword.

I threw up my hands and said the only Japanese word I knew: “Gomenasai!” The ninja sheathed his sword. “You should not be here. Return to your time before the Shogun finds you.” My adventure over, I scrambled back to the time machine. My childhood had not lied - ninjas were as deadly and stealthy as the movies portrayed. And thanks to one merciful ninja, I lived to tell the tale.
