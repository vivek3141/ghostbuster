I awoke with a start, my heart pounding. The dream had been so vivid. I was in ancient Ireland, a warrior defending the land of Ulster. My name was Cú Chulainn, the Hound of Culann. 

As I sat up in bed, the memories flooded through me. I remembered a life long ago, fighting enemies and beasts alike with my magical spear Gae Bulg and my sword Cruaidín Catutchenn. I had superhuman strength and a fierce warrior spirit. They called me the protector of Ulster.

But now I found myself in a strange world. There were metal carriages racing down stone paths, people carrying small devices that let them communicate across vast distances. The land I knew was gone. My people, the Ulaid, had vanished into myth and legend.

I walked to the mirror and gazed at the man looking back - ordinary, unassuming. Yet within me burned the soul of a hero. A warrior without a war. 

As the sun rose over this bustling, modern city, I knew what I must do. The warrior spirit cannot be contained. And there are always threats, for those with eyes to see them. 

I may wear different garb and speak a strange tongue, but inside remains a protector. My people may be gone, but there are always those who need defending. The tools and techniques have changed, but not the calling.

I am Cú Chulainn, reborn in this modern world. My time has come again. The hound stirs once more.
