The light faded and I found myself in an endless white void. In the distance, glowing text appeared:

Welcome to new game+. You will begin your life anew, but retain all knowledge, skills, currency and items you choose to carry over. The Challenges and Enemies will be adapted to your level accordingly.  

I blinked in disbelief. A new life? I pondered what to carry over. My knowledge and skills were most valuable. The rest seemed trivial. I selected those options.

The white void morphed into a familiar scene—the hospital room where I was born. But now with my adult mind intact. I started crying, an act that came naturally. 

As an infant, life moved fast. My parents were overjoyed at my development. I walked and talked far earlier than expected.  My childhood was lonely as I struggled to connect with peers. I aced every test but constantly questioned the point of elementary education, having done it before.

My teenage years were turbulent. Hormones raged through my body again while my mind remained adult. I rebelled against my parents strict rules which now seemed pointless. I craved intellectual discussions about politics, philosophy, and the mysteries of life, but classmates only wanted to chat about crushes and revenge. 

College was an escape and salvation. Surrounded by open-minded people, I could finally unleash my mind. I devoured every subject, flourishing in the challenging concepts. My professors took interest in my unusual maturity and depth of thought. 

Life moved in fast forward again. Marriage, kids, career success—all while grasping at meaning and purpose. The 'Challenges' were adapting, but I struggled to find true happiness and fulfillment.

While death remained the only way out of this loop, a part of me now understood why most souls do not retain memories across lives. Ignorance is bliss. My 'new game+' was a reminder that with age and experience, life mostly reveals how little we truly comprehend. The real meaning continues escaping our grasp, remaining forever out of reach.
