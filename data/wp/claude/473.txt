The twin suns of Prima Giedi were beginning to set as Jenna walked through the rust-colored fields back to the colony. It had been another long day of maintenance on the atmospheric processors, making sure the breathable air and pleasant temperatures that made life on Prima Giedi possible were sustained. 

As she walked, her eyes drifted up to the sky, watching as the larger orange sun slowly dipped below the horizon, its brilliant light refracting into a dazzling array of colors through the thick blanket of methane clouds swirling high above. The smaller red sun would follow in another few hours, leaving the planet in a deep chill until they rose together again.

These quiet moments as the workday ended were what Jenna lived for. The solitude and sweeping alien vistas of this world made her feel at peace in a way she had never quite achieved back on Earth. She smiled as a flock of bird-like quad-winged creatures flew in a V-formation across the sky, their scales reflecting the dwindling sunlight. Prima Giedi was teeming with bioengineered species like these, inhabiting every ecological niche of this pulverized rock that humans now called home.

As Jenna walked up the ramp into her housing unit, she inhaled the familiar smell of the synthesized wood panels and ruggrass matting. She poured herself a glass of golden melon nectar, its sweet aroma filling her sparse kitchen. As she sipped it, she peered out the window at the domed buildings of the colony in the distance. Over 8,000 people now called this place home, surviving and thriving against all odds on this distant world. 

She thought of the financial incentives offered by the colony program that had tempted her to sign up as a habitat maintenance technician. At the time, the opportunity to pick up stakes and move to an exotic new world seemed like a grand adventure. And it had been, but not in the way she had imagined. The harsh conditions and arduous work of establishing humanity's first long-term colony among the stars had tested her in ways she never could have fathomed. But she had persevered, through ups and downs, for over 15 years now. This was her home.

As the second sun dipped below the horizon and the sky faded to a dusky violet, Jenna finished her meal in silence. Through her window, a few twinkling stars became visible in the darkening sky. She smiled, comforted by the knowledge that orbiting high above, mostly hidden by daylight, was a bustling space station where shuttles regularly arrived from Earth, bringing new colonists and supplies to help continue the grand human tradition of curiosity, courage and perseverance in the face of the unknown. She was proud to do her small part to enable the human foothold in this remote stellar system take one step further. This was her purpose. This was Prima Giedi.
