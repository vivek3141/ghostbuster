The day I left to war, she told me not to come back home. Her words echoed in my mind as the transport rumbled down the dusty road, taking me away from Amy and everything I knew. 

We had grown up together, Amy and I, spending long summer days by the creek and cozy winter nights before the fireplace. Our parents always expected us to get married. And I had planned to propose to Amy on her 18th birthday.

But the war changed everything. When the call came for volunteers, I knew I had to go, to serve our country and protect our way of life. Amy begged me not to go. She said she had a terrible fear I wouldn't return. I promised her I would come back, that we would get married and continue our lives together.

The morning I prepared to leave with the other recruits, Amy came to see me off. But instead of saying goodbye, she uttered those fateful words: "Don't come back." And then she simply walked away.

Her words carved a hole in my heart. As the transport rode further from the town, I kept replaying our last moments in my mind. I didn't understand why she had said what she did. I had made a promise to return, but now I feared what might await me if I did.

The war was long and brutal. More than once I wondered if I would ever make it home. Amy's words haunted me, but they also gave me a strange kind of purpose.  I was determined to make it back to see her, whether she wanted me there or not. I had to know why she said what she did. 

After four long years, the war was finally over. As my comrades celebrated, I steeled myself for what was to come. The transport rode into town, and my heart raced as I arrived at Amy's door. This time, she didn't turn me away. With tears in her eyes, she explained she had uttered those awful words in a moment of despair at our parting, hoping it would make her loss easier to bear. But all she had longed for since was my return.

And as she welcomed me home at last, I knew I would never leave again. My place was here, with Amy, just as it always had been.
