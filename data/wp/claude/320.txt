The dark clouds rolled in, swelling with the promise of a fierce storm. Mark glanced out the window of the diner, his fork frozen halfway to his mouth. His stomach churned as he watched the sky darken. 

He looked across the table at his sister, Jenny, happily chatting with her boyfriend, oblivious to the impending downpour. He cleared his throat. "Hey, we should get going soon. Storm's coming in."

Jenny waved her hand dismissively. "We'll be fine. It's just a little rain."

"Doesn't look little to me," Mark muttered. But he said nothing more, turning his attention back to his cooling pancakes. His appetite was gone but he forced himself to take another bite.

Fifteen minutes later, the sky opened up. Rain lashed the windows of the diner as thunder shook the building.  Mark's heart raced with every boom. He dropped his fork with a clatter, drawing annoyed looks from neighboring customers. 

"Jenny, we have to go," he said, struggling to keep his voice steady. 

She glared at him. "What is your problem? We're already here, just chill out."

He took a shaky breath, acutely aware of the other people around them. "I can't do storms. You know that. Can we please just go home?" He hated how pathetic he sounded, but at this point his fear outweighed his pride.

"God, you're such a baby." She turned back to her boyfriend, dismissing him again. Mark's face burned with shame and anger.

The lights flickered as another thunderclap rattled the windows. Before he knew what he was doing, Mark had slid out of the booth and thrown down some cash. "I'm leaving. Now."

Jenny gaped at him in disbelief. He didn't wait for her response before storming outside into the downpour. The rain lashed at his face and soaked through his clothes in seconds. He fumbled for his keys with trembling fingers as a bolt of lightning lit up the sky, followed seconds later by a boom of thunder that shook his chest. 

His heart racing, Mark scrambled into his car. But in his haste, the keys slipped from his fingers into a puddle forming in the parking lot. He dove down to grab them but they were just out of reach. 

A burst of laughter made him whirl around. Jenny and her smug boyfriend were watching him struggle, clearly enjoying the show. Rage burned inside him, momentarily overpowering his fear of the storm.

Mark straightened up, matching his sister's glare. His voice was deadly calm when he spoke. "If you ever talk to me like that again, we're done. I don't need your crap." 

With that, he turned away from her shocked face without a second glance. His fear had disappeared, replaced by determination. He could face this storm and any challenge it brought. He didn't need Jenny or anyone else to get through it.

Mark took a deep breath, steadied his nerves, and bent down to pluck his keys from the puddle.
