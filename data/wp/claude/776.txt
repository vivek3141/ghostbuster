The Scout ships descended from the clouds, blotting out the sun. At first, panic ensued in the streets below as people feared another attack. Five years ago, the invaders known as the Sentinels nearly wiped humanity from the Earth.  

But as the ships landed, no weapons were fired. No troops emerged. Instead, a booming voice echoed across the city, "People of Earth, we come in peace. We beg for mercy. Call off your scouts. No more destruction!"

Scouts? The people were confused. Then realization dawned - the voice meant the players of No Man's Sky, the virtual reality universe that had become all the rage after the Sentinel war. In the game, players explored a digital galaxy, discovering and naming new planets. They often fought and defeated the alien Sentinels they found there.

A representative of the aliens emerged from the ship, a bipedal but otherwise inhuman creature. "We surrender. The creatures your kind have named 'Sentinels' in your game are peaceful farmers and explorers like yourselves. But the weapons and ships you have designed to defeat us have been replicated and unleashed upon our people. We cannot withstand the onslaught. Call off your players before our entire civilization is wiped out!"

There were gasps and murmurs in the crowd. A lone man stepped forward, brandishing a copy of the game. "You mean... you're the Sentinels from No Man's Sky?" 

The alien bowed its head. "We are. And we beg you - limit your galactic conquest to the digital realm. Do not let it destroy our people any further!"  

The lead developer of No Man's Sky stepped up, pale. "I'll issue an update and patch immediately. Players will no longer be able to find or fight Sentinels. Your people will be safe."

The alien smiled in relief. "Thank you, people of Earth. The stars are safe again because of your mercy. We shall not forget this." The ships began to ascend once more into the sky.
