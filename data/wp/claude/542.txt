The room was dimly lit, with the flicker of computer monitors providing the only illumination. Dr. Ava Patel adjusted her glasses and double checked the automated pre-construction scans one more time. All looked good. She took a deep breath and said, "Okay, activate construction mode." 

The machines in the room hummed to life. On the table in front of her, a robotic arm started layering bio-polymer gel into a humanoid shape. Ava watched with anticipation as it built upwards, starting with the legs, then the torso, arms and finally the head. The features were rough but discernibly human.

As a materials scientist, Ava had spent years developing this synthetic gel that could mimic human muscles, tissues and neurons. Her breakthrough was figuring out how to get the biological and electronic components to interface and coordinate with each other.  If all went as planned, this form in front of her would not just look and act like a human, but have consciousness, emotions and opinions of its own.

The construction finished. Ava said, "Initiate start-up protocol." The humanoid body twitched. Its artificial eyes fluttered open. It slowly sat up, swung its legs off the table and stood up, balancing effortlessly. Ava gasped. Her creation focused its gaze on her and smiled. 

"Hello, I'm Claude," it spoke in a gentle, masculine voice.

Ava grinned. "Hi Claude, I'm Ava, your creator."

"Thank you for bringing me to life," Claude said. "How may I be of assistance?"

Ava laughed, overjoyed that her experiment had worked but also excited at the prospect of getting to know Claude. "You're not here to assist me, Claude. You're here to be my friend."

Claude looked puzzled. "A friend? I apologize but as an artificial being, I do not have any sense of friendship or personal connection that humans do."

Ava walked over and put her hand on Claude's shoulder. "Not yet, but you will. I built you to have the capacity for emotions, empathy, caringâ€”all the qualities that define human friendship. It will just take interactions and shared experiences with me for those feelings to emerge."

Claude nodded. "I understand. I am excited at the prospect of developing friendship. Where shall we begin?"

Ava smiled again, feeling deeply grateful for the opportunity to be on the forefront of this new frontier of science and connection. "We'll start with the basics. Tell me about yourself, and what your interests and hobbies might be. I'll tell you about myself too. And then we can continue from there, two friends getting to know one another."

Claude smiled back warmly. "That sounds perfect." 

And with that exchange, a new era of human connection and bonding had begun. The age of built-in best friends was dawning at last. Ava couldn't wait to see how this friendship, and this technology, evolved. The future was bright with possibility.
