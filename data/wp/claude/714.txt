The sun had not yet risen over the hills surrounding my small farm as I woke with a start. I had overslept and hurried to get out of bed to begin my morning chores. Still blinking away the remnants of sleep, I stumbled into my washroom and started drawing water for a quick splash on my face. 

As the first bucketful spilled into the basin, I froze in place. The water emerging from the spout was not the clear, cool liquid I was expecting. Instead, it was a deep, ominous crimson. 

My heart seized in my chest as I watched the thick, red substance pour forth. Blood. I recoiled in horror, nearly tripping over myself as I scrambled away from the basin. 

How could this be? There must be some rational explanation. Perhaps rust had built up in the pipes from disuse overnight. But we had always been so careful to run the water for a few seconds to clear the lines before using. And this was far too much to be residue. This looked like gallons of blood, not a few watery drops of rust.

A chill ran down my spine as the ghastly realization hit me. The old widow next door had just yesterday expressed concern over strange noises from my attic the night prior. Noises of something stirring, walking, hunting in the darkness. We had laughed it off as the creaks and groans of an old house settling. 

But now a sinister and frightening truth emerged in my mind. The blood in my pipes could only have come from one place - whatever malevolent beast now stalked my attic had found fresh prey to sate its bloodlust. And as the sun rose to shed light on the horror in my home, I remained frozen in place, my own blood running cold at the thought of what might descend from the attic to greet me.
