My darling Madeline, there is something I have been keeping from you since the first day we met, but now that we are married, I feel I can finally share this secret. I have a most unusual ability - I am able to travel back in time. 

You look at me askance, understandably skeptical of such an outrageous claim. But it is the truth, my dear. This gift, or curse as it sometimes feels, has been part of me since birth. I do not understand why or how, but I have learned over the years how to control it and use it judiciously. 

And use it I did, to make you mine. Do you remember when we first encountered each other three years ago, in the park? That meeting was not by chance. I had seen you there, a vision in lilac, a week before - a week in the future, that is. I knew in that instant I had to make your acquaintance, so I traveled back to arrange our "first" meeting.

You look shocked, and I cannot blame you. But please do not judge me too harshly. My motives were pure, I assure you. I simply knew I had to get to know the beautiful, kind-hearted woman I had glimpsed in that brief moment a week ahead. So I rewound time and contrived to meet you during that walk in the park. 

From that day onward, I continued to use my gift to learn little details about you and to ensure I expressed them to gain your affection. I hate to admit I had an unfair advantage, my dear, but how else could I secure the heart of the most perfect woman I have ever known without some manipulation of events?

I can see how troubled you are by this revelation, and I sorely regret that. But I could not in good conscience keep this secret from you as my wife. My ability is as much a part of me as my soul, and I do not wish there to be any hidden parts between us in our marriage. 

You will need time to process this, I understand. I only hope that in time you will see that though I used questionable means initially, my love for you now is deeply real and true. And I swear I shall never again manipulate time to influence you without your consent. My gift is at your disposal, as am I, my dearest love. I await your judgment and hope for your forgiveness.
