I blinked and the memory was gone, erased from my mind as if it had never happened. A few keystrokes and it was banished to the void. 

It was a strange gift, being able to manipulate my own memories with a thought. I had discovered it by accident a few years ago. A particularly painful recollection of an embarrassing high school moment started to fade as I was dwelling on it, losing details and potency until it was but a hazy impression. I realized, with a mix of wonder and trepidation, that I had somehow edited it away.

Since then I practiced and honed this peculiar ability, learning how to delete and create memories with precision. It was like film editing, slicing and rearranging bits and pieces of my mental history into new narratives. I could take a mundane day at the office and turn it into an adventure, implanting the memory of a surprise birthday party that never took place. If I made a mistake at work, I could wipe the slate clean and forge a memory of doing everything right.  

But it was also a dangerous gift. I lived in a constant state of doubt about my own past, unable to trust my own recollections. Were they real or fabricated? Self-deception was always a temptation, and I had to be vigilant not to abuse my power and lose touch with the truth.

There were also gaps, memories I had deleted that left an empty space where something used to be. I ran my mental fingers over those voids like a tongue probing the empty socket of a missing tooth. The holes served as a warning, a reminder not to cut too deep or remove too much. My memory was a patchwork, sewn together from fragments of experience, impressions that may or may not reflect what really happened. 

In the end, I tried to use my ability sparingly, and mainly for small edits and touch-ups. The truth is too precious to sacrifice, even if fantasy holds its allure. My memory is a record of all that has made me, for better and for worse. As tempting as it might be to alter the past, I must accept it, gaps and all, and make peace with who I am and how I came to be. The gift of rewriting my history, it seems, is one I was never meant to possess.
