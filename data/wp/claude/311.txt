You dig up a time capsule you buried years ago. Instead of memorabilia, you find a modern phone. It rings.  

You hadn't thought about the time capsule in years. Burying it as a kid seemed fun at the time—a way to connect with your future self. But as you grew up, the memory faded. It wasn't until your mom mentioned it recently that you were struck with curiosity about what was inside.

After a few hours of digging in the backyard, your shovel hit something solid. You cleared away the dirt to find a metal box, a bit rusted but still intact. "This is it!" you exclaimed. Your heart raced as you pried open the lid.

But what was inside wasn't what you expected. No baseball cards, no old notes or photos. Just a slick, modern cellphone. As you lifted it from the box, it suddenly sprang to life, the screen lighting up and buzzing in your hand.  

"What the...?" The phone was ringing. An unknown number flashed on the screen. This had to be some kind of prank. You swiped to answer the call, hands shaking. "H-hello?"

"Hey...is this you?" The voice on the other end sounded familiar but you couldn't quite place it. "I know this is going to sound strange, but I'm you...from the future."

Your mind reeled. This had to be impossible. "What? How?" you stammered.

The voice on the phone sighed. "I buried this phone years ago, hoping this call could happen. I know talking to my past self would create a paradox, but I had to risk it to send a warning. Don't go to the city tomorrow. Stay home no matter what."  

A warning? Your head spun trying to make sense of this bizarre situation. "Why, what happens tomorrow?" you asked, gripped by a mixture of confusion and dread.

"I can't say too much. Time is fragile. Just promise me you'll stay home tomorrow, no matter what. The future depends on it." The call clicked off, leaving you in stunned silence.  

You stared at the mysterious phone in your hands, mind racing with questions that couldn't be answered. What were you supposed to believe? Was it really a message from the future or just an elaborate trick? But what if it was real—and staying home tomorrow could actually change your destiny? You shook your head, at a loss for what to think or how to proceed. The only thing you knew for sure was that tomorrow, your choice might alter the course of your life in ways you couldn't possibly foresee.
