The old cabin sat alone in the woods, half-covered in overgrown weeds and vines. Jenny had discovered it while hiking one day and was instantly drawn to its rustic charm. She decided it would make a perfect getaway for a writing retreat. 

A few weeks later, Jenny packed up her laptop, a bag of groceries, and her dog Chewy and drove out to the cabin. She spent the days writing on the creaky front porch, the words flowing out of her. Chewy explored the surrounding woods, chasing squirrels and birds.

At night, Jenny built a fire in the stone fireplace and cooked dinner over the open flames. The cabin had no electricity, but she found she didn’t miss it. She went to sleep each night to the sounds of the crackling firewood and Chewy’s soft snores.

One night, a powerful storm rolled in. Rain pelted the metal roof of the cabin as lightning flashed and thunder boomed outside. Chewy whimpered, huddling close to Jenny on the bed. She stroked his fur to soothe him. 

In the middle of the night, a loud crash woke Jenny with a start. Her first thought was that a tree had fallen, until she noticed one of the wooden shutters hanging off its hinges, banging in the wind. She went outside in her pajamas with a flashlight to take down the shutter.

As Jenny walked around to the damaged side of the house, her flashlight flickered over a pair of eyes staring at her through a window. Her heart leapt into her throat. She swung her flashlight back, but the eyes were gone. She must have imagined them.

Jenny removed the shutter and went back inside, laughing at herself for being so silly. Probably just a reflection of some kind. She gave Chewy a pat and crawled back into bed, listening to the sounds of the slowing storm. The shutters creaked as the wind died down, lulling her to sleep. Her eyes were just drifting closed when she heard the floorboards inside the cabin creak.  Chewy let out a low growl. Jenny’s eyes flew open. She wasn’t alone.
