I woke up to an unusually quiet house. Normally I would hear my family bustling about, getting ready for the day. But today, silence. 

I walked down the stairs, expecting everyone to jump out and surprise me with a birthday cake or some sort of celebration. But the living room was empty. The kitchen deserted. I called out but nobody responded.

A strange feeling started to overtake me. Where was everyone? I checked the driveway—all the cars were there. Had they gone for a walk? No, it was much too early for anyone in my house to be up and exercising. 

I checked all the bedrooms. The beds were made, everything was in order, but there were no signs of where anyone had gone. I called my parents’ cell phones, my sister’s phone, but they all went straight to voicemail. 

Panic started rising in my chest as the realization dawned on me: there was nobody home. Nobody on the street outside either. The neighborhood seemed to be completely empty. Like everyone just up and vanished.

At a loss, I sat down at the kitchen table, trying to figure out my next steps. Call the police? Call other family friends? I had no idea what was going on or what to do next. I just knew that the silence surrounding me no longer felt surprising or celebratory. It felt cold, creepy, and very, very frightening without my friends and family around. The surprise party seemed less and less likely. All I wanted was for someone, anyone, to jump out and end this nightmare.
