The knock at the door startled me. I peered out the peephole and saw two police officers. My heart raced. They had finally come for me. 

I opened the door slowly. "Can I help you, officers?"

The older officer frowned. "Are you Mark Johnson?"

I swallowed hard. "Yes, that's me."

"Mr. Johnson, we have a warrant for your arrest. You'll have to come with us to the station."

My knees buckled. "What's the charge?" I stammered.

"Conspiracy and fraud. Please turn around and put your hands behind your back." He snapped handcuffs on my wrists while reciting my Miranda rights.

At the station, they fingerprinted and photographed me. I was allowed one phone call, to my lawyer. He promised to meet me there right away. I paced in the cell, panicking. How did they find out? I had covered my tracks so carefully.

My lawyer arrived, looking grim. "I'm afraid it's not good," he said. "They have multiple witnesses and documents linking you to the offshore accounts." 

I slumped onto the bench. "I don't understand. I was so careful. How did they get witnesses? No one knew about this except me."

He sighed. "Mark, you have to face the facts. The entire world was against you on this one. It wouldn't have been fair otherwise."

I shook my head in disbelief. "What are you talking about? The whole world wasn't in on this!"  

"Not literally the whole world. But in cases of major financial fraud, there are systems in place to detect and investigate illegal activity. Multiple international agencies were involved in cracking this case open. The amount of data and human intelligence involved, there was very little chance you'd get away with it. I'm sorry, but you have to realize that the odds were stacked against you all along."

I sat in stunned silence. He was right. I thought I was outsmarting everyone, but the truth was, the world's systems and laws ensured I never really had a chance. My hubris had allowed me to believe, just for a moment, that I was untouchable. But no one is untouchable. The world makes sure of that.
