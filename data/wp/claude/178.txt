We had met so many times over the years that Death and I were on a first name basis. "Another close call, my friend," Death would say, his bony hand resting on my shoulder. His touch was cold but not unpleasant.

The first time we met I was seven years old, struck by a car while riding my bike. Death waited by my hospital bed for three days, expecting to guide me to the other side. But I rallied and recovered. "Not your time yet, it seems," Death said with what I could only interpret as a smile.

We crossed paths again when I was 22, this time from too much alcohol and a foolish accident that should have been deadly. But once more I scraped by, albeit worse for wear. "You continue to surprise me," Death remarked. I was too woozy to respond.

There were other brushes over the yearsâ€”a climbing fall in the Himilayas, a nasty bout of pneumonia in my 30s, a violent mugging where I lost a lot of blood. Each time I could sense Death watching and waiting patiently, but somehow I persevered and lived on.  

Oddly, I came to find solace in his presence. Death, while fearsome in aspect, did not seem malevolent. Merely dutiful. "I do not relish taking anyone before their time," he told me once. "I simply follow the course that has been laid out."

By my 50th birthday, we had met almost a dozen times. I contemplated my own mortality and wondered if this latest encounter might be the last. "Do not dread our eventual final meeting," Death counseled me. "All lives end, as they are meant to. I am but an escort to life's next adventure."

His words gave me an odd sense of peace. Death was not the enemy, merely a companion I had come to know well over the journey of life. My brushes with him reminded me to live fully while I was still drawing breath, to embrace each day as a gift. In a strange way, I was grateful for every moment I had eluded his grasp.

Perhaps when the end comes at last in some quiet future, Death will remain by my side as an old familiar friend. His bony hand will rest on my shoulder once more, and together we will walk into the night. But for today I have avoided his call yet again. And so I will venture forth to taste life's sweetness anew, knowing how precious each sip is. My faithful companion will be waiting when the time is right, as he always has. But not yet. Thankfully, not just yet.
