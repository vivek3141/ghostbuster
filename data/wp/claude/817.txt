The steady beep of the heart monitor was the only sound in the dimly lit hospital room. Thomas lay in the bed, tubes and wires connected to his body. His breath fogged the oxygen mask over his face. 

He didn't know how long he had been in the ICU. The days and nights blurred together into an endless loop of tests, nurses coming and going, snatches of fretful sleep. His body felt weak and heavy, unable to heal from the trauma of the car accident.

As Thomas gazed out the window at the night sky, a figure caught his eye. It was a tall, shadowy form passing by the door of his room. He blinked, sure it must be a nurse or doctor. But an icy tingle went down his spine. The figure stopped and slowly turned to face his room. It was Death, shrouded all in black with a pale skull face.

Thomas's heart raced in panic. His monitor shrieked as Death began to glide silently into his room, skeletal fingers reaching out to Thomas. This was it - the end had come for him at last.

But Death simply pulled up a chair and sat down next to Thomas's bed. "Do not be afraid," Death said, his voice a soft rasp. "I am not here for you tonight."

Thomas stared in shock, his panic subsiding into confusion. "Then...why are you here?" he asked through the mask.

"I came to offer you a reminder," Death replied. "Your time in this world is fleeting. Life as you know it can change in an instant, as you have recently experienced." He gestured to the hospital room around them. "Do not waste the moments you have been given."

With that, Death rose and glided from the room as silently as he had come. The heart monitor slowed to a steady, normal pulse. 

Thomas gazed up at the night sky outside the window again. A feeling of deep calm and clarity came over him. Death was right - life was a fragile, temporary gift. As he healed and eventually left this place, he knew he would never again forget how precious each moment was. 

When Death came again for him, as he knew it someday must, he would be able to say he lived well and left nothing unsaid - no opportunity to love wasted, no beauty or joy left overlooked, however small it seemed. For now he still had time, and that was all that mattered. He closed his eyes with a sense of peace and purpose, embracing the fleeting wonder of life renewed once more.
