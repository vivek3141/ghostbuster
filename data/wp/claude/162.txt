The big day had arrived. Dr. Victor Frankenstein peered out from behind the curtain at the expectant crowd eagerly awaiting the start of the bodybuilding competition. How did he get himself into this mess?

A few weeks ago, Victor received a mysterious invitation in the mail. "Congratulations! You have been selected to compete in the prestigious Zurich Athletic Championships based on your outstanding physique and dedication to physical excellence." 

Victor was perplexed. He was a scientist, not an athlete. His physique was rather unremarkable. There must have been a mistake. He called the organizers to inform them they had the wrong person.

"Nonsense!" they exclaimed. "You are too modest, Dr. Frankenstein. We have heard all about your greatest creation. Now it's time to showcase your handiwork to the world!"

Victor was dumbfounded. His greatest creation? Surely they didn't mean...then it dawned on him. His creature! Those foolish organizers thought HE was the creature. No amount of explaining could convince them of their ridiculous error. They had already advertised "The Mighty Frankenstein" as a contestant and ticket sales were booming. Victor was stuck. He couldn't disappoint the expectant fans and organizers. But he couldn't unleash his creature on the unsuspecting spectators either. There was only one option left. He would have to represent his creation.

Standing behind the curtain in an oversized coat and fedora, Victor gazed with envy at the gleaming muscles and physical prowess of the other competitors. When his name was announced, he strode onto the stage, waving reluctantly to the wild cheers of the crowd. 

At the judges' instructions, he slowly removed his coat, loosening his necktie and avoiding eye contact with the increasingly confused audience. His spindly body and pallid complexion elicited gasps of shock and dismay.  This was not what they were expecting of the great Frankenstein.

Victor endured the rest of the tedious competition with quiet dignity, posing uncomfortably and leaping with feeble effort in the showmanship round. Mercifully, he was not selected as a finalist, spared a question and answer session to explain the obvious discrepancy between his actual self and the mountain of muscle they had anticipated. 

Escaping as quickly as possible to avoid his adoring fans, Victor vowed never again to correct a misunderstanding, no matter how absurd, lest he end up in another predicament like the Zurich Athletic Championships. The world was not ready for the truth about Frankenstein. His greatest creation would remain out of sight, and he, Dr. Victor Frankenstein, would continue his work in blessed anonymity.
