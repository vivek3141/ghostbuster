The Upvotes That Count 

Karma was everything. In this world, your Reddit karma determined your station in life. And I was barely scraping by.

I lived in a tiny pod in LowKarmaCity, surviving on synthetic food and drinking recycled water. I had a measly 274 karma points to my name. Pathetic. The high rollers in r/CenturyClub with 100,000+ karma wanted for nothing. 

I was determined to increase my karma and level up to MiddleKarmaSuburbs. No more pods, real food, clean water. Simple dreams. But posting on Reddit was a skill, an art form. I had to study the masters.

I analyzed top posts and comments for patterns. Short quips, witty comebacks, funny memes—these garnered steady upvotes. Appealing to the majority and following the herd was key. Original thoughts or against-the-grain opinions were downvote magnets.

I crafted a few posts and commented on rising threads. My karma inched up but plateaued quickly. I realized reposting old popular posts and comments was necessary to gain real traction. I hated plagiarizing others but my survival was at stake.

One night, I reposted a meme that hit the front page a year ago. When I woke, my karma had skyrocketed to 5,000. I almost screamed. With shaky hands I updated my Reddit profile to list my new karma score. By the next day, an acceptance message appeared in my pod: “Congratulations! You have been upgraded to MiddleKarmaSuburbs.”

A transport was scheduled to retrieve me the following morning. I couldn’t sleep that night. As I gathered my few belongings, I felt a twinge of guilt. My achievement was built on the work of others. But the temptation of a better life in MiddleKarmaSuburbs trumped any regret. 

The transport arrived and I eagerly stepped inside, turning my back on LowKarmaCity forever. My future was looking brighter. I was now a somebody in this world where the upvotes are all that count. My struggle to rise up the karma ranks had just begun.
