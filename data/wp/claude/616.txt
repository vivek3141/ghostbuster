I sat in the ominously dim waiting room, my knee bouncing with nervous energy. The leather chair creaked as I shifted, checking my watch for the hundredth time. Finally, a hidden door slid open with a mechanical whir and a menacing figure emerged. 

"Mr. Jones, we meet at last. Come in, come in!" The man gestured me into the door with a black-gloved hand.

I followed him into a high-tech control room filled with monitors. In the center, a large chair swiveled around to face me, revealing a bald man with an eye patch.

"Have a seat Mr. Jones. As you know, you are here about the open henchman position. Why don't you tell me why you think you would be a good fit for this role?"

I cleared my throat, willing my voice to remain steady. "Well, sir, I have been training my whole life for an opportunity like this. I am highly competent in weapons and combat. I have no family or friends to distract me. And most importantly, I believe in your vision for world domination and would stop at nothing to see your grand plans come to fruition." 

The man chuckled, a low sinister sound. "A fine speech. But how do I know you have what it takes?" He snapped his fingers.

A panel in the wall slid open, revealing an elaborate obstacle course, lasers dancing at throat level. "Complete my course in 2 minutes and the job is yours. Fail, and our business here is done."

I eyed the treacherous course, taking a deep breath. "Challenge accepted."

At the start signal, I threw myself into the course. Ducking and leaping through the laser grid, I made quick work of the shifting floors and automated battering rams looking to knock me off course. With seconds to spare, I rolled under the final laser to finish, slightly singed but victorious.

"Well done!" The man exclaimed, clapping slowly. He shook my hand, his cold metal-encased grip firm. "Welcome aboard. You begin immediately. What shall I call you?‚Äù 

"Sir, my code name is Silent Thunder."  

"Excellent. Now, Silent Thunder, it's time to get to work. We have a world to dominate." His laughter echoed as I smiled, ready to serve my new evil mastermind. My life as a henchman was about to begin.
