The Starcruiser slowly approached the brightly colored world of Waltaria. Megan pressed her hands against the viewing window, her twin daughters Emily and Zoe bouncing with excitement beside her.

When Disney had announced they were purchasing an uninhabited Earth-like planet to convert into the ultimate amusement park, the whole solar system buzzed with anticipation. After 10 years of construction, Waltaria was finally opening. Megan had saved for years to take her family on the inaugural voyage and surprise the girls for their 12th birthday. 

As the Starcruiser entered orbit, an animated Mickey Mouse appeared on the cabin monitors. “Welcome, intergalactic travelers, to Waltaria! Please prepare for landing and enjoy your magical journey!” Emily and Zoe squealed.

The Starcruiser touched down just outside the Disney Castle, a massive rose-tinted structure that dwarfed any castle on Earth. Other starships were landing nearby, disgorging excited visitors from across the galaxy. 

As Megan and her family strolled under the front gates, chipper music filled the air. “Look, it’s Main Street!” Emily cried, pointing to a boulevard lined with stores selling stuffed animals, glow cubes, and snacks of every color. 

Zoe grabbed a park map. “Seven lands! Tomorrowland, Fantasyland, Adventure Isle, Frontier Colony, Coaster Country, Aquatopia...” Her eyes grew wide. “And Star Wars Land!”

They decided to start with Tomorrowland, a gleaming city of spaceship spires, robotics labs, and spinning jet cars. They rode a anti-gravity coaster, explored an intergalactic space station, and watched a Pixar holo-film adventure. After a light-speed lunch at the Cosmic Ray's Diner, they shot through a transwarp tunnel to Star Wars Land, where an imposing Imperial Star Destroyer dominated the sky. 

“Look, Mom, Jedi Academy!” Emily said, pointing to a temple-like structure. “Can we watch a show?”

“Of course, birthday girl,” Megan said, and they entered the academy. Soon, Emily and Zoe were selected from the crowd to train with lightsabers and use the Force against an Evil Sith Lord, helped by wisecracking droids R2-D2 and C-3PO. They came off stage aglow, clutching certificates naming them Official Padawans. Megan couldn't stop smiling.

As night fell over Frontier Colony's log cabins and Adventure Isle's ancient temple, the family gathered with thousands of others before Cinderella's Castle. Fireworks exploded in artistic starbursts, spaceships swooped overhead, and classic Disney songs swelled as holograms depicted beloved characters and movie scenes. 

“This was the best birthday ever!” Emily exclaimed, hugging her mom and sister tight. Zoe nodded in enthusiastic agreement. 

Megan gazed at the castle, swathed in fireworks and fantasy. Her girls were growing up, but here in this place made of wishes and imagination, they would forever remain children at heart. And she knew Waltaria was a world they would revisit again and again, bonding over thrills and adventure for many birthdays to come.
