I woke with a start, heart pounding. Something felt off. Then I saw it—a note in unfamiliar handwriting on the pillow next to me:

Get out now. They're coming for you. 

What? I racked my brain but had no memory of writing this. Who's coming for me? Panic started to rise as I looked around the room. Everything seemed in place. Had I gotten up in the middle of the night and scribbled this strange warning? That didn't make any sense. 

I got out of bed and peeked out the window. The street below looked normal. No ominous figures lurking about. I did a lap around my apartment. All clear. The doors were still locked. 

Was this some kind of prank? But who would do this, and how did they get in and out without waking me? I live alone on the top floor of a secure building. None of this added up.

I examined the note again. The handwriting seemed familiar, like a distorted version of my own. Like I had written it in a frenzy or panic. But I had no memory of that either. 

I took a deep breath to stave off the anxiety threating to drown me. “Get a grip,” I told myself. There had to be a logical explanation. I'd been under a lot of stress at work. Maybe I had gotten up in a confused, half-asleep stupor and scribbled the note before falling back into a deep slumber, too exhausted to remember.  

Yes, that made sense. The note was just the illogical result of overwork and lack of sleep. I crumpled it up, tossed it in the trash, and headed to the kitchen to make coffee. There was nothing sinister going on here. Just the tricks of an overtired mind. I took comfort in the familiar morning routine and settled in for the day, shaking off the last tendrils of uncertainty that had grasped at me upon waking.
