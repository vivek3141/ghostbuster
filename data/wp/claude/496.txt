The old boat gently rocked in the low surf, stuck on the sandbar a few hundred feet from shore. Mark sighed, frustrated at his predicament. He had been so eager to take his new boat out for a spin that he hadn't paid close enough attention to the tides. Now here he was, high and dry, the water level too low for the boat's hull to clear the sandbar. 

Mark peered at the horizon, hoping to see some signs of the tide coming back in. But the ocean was as calm as could be, glistening under the hot sun. Not even a hint of the water level rising. He was stuck here for at least a few hours until the tide returned.

His phone had no signal this far out, so calling for help wasn't an option. Mark rummaged through the boat's small cooler and found some snacks to tide him over. At least he wouldn't starve or dehydrate. But being stranded was not how he envisioned this maiden voyage going.

As the hours passed slowly, Mark's boredom and frustration mounted. He tried reading but couldn't focus. He turned on the boat's radio but could only find staticky stations to listen to. His legs cramped from sitting so long. All he could do was stare at the beach, so close yet so far away.

The tide did finally come back in, as Mark knew it would. But in those long, empty hours stranded on the sandbar, something changed in him. His eagerness to rush into adventures faded, replaced with a newfound appreciation for preparation and patience. While adrift, he realized how little control he had over the rhythms of the natural world. Once he floated free and navigated back to shore, Mark promised himself he would never again end up literally and figuratively "high and dry." And next time, he would definitely check the tide charts first before heading out to sea.
