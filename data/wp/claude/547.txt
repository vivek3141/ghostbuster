The Rain 

The rain pounded on the rooftop, a steady beat that had continued for hours. Miranda sat by the window, her book open but unread in her lap, gazing at the rivulets of water running down the glass pane. The world outside was gray and hazy, the trees across the yard swaying and dripping under the relentless downpour.

She sighed and closed her book, unable to focus on the words. The rain always made her melancholy like this, trapping her indoors and isolating her from the outside world. As a child, the rain meant puddles to splash in and the smell of wet grass, giggles as she jumped into muddy lakes forming on the sidewalk. But now the rain meant dreariness and solitude.

In the kitchen, Miranda heard her mother putting away groceries, the crinkle of paper bags and the opening and closing of cabinets. The familiar, comforting sounds made the silence and loneliness Miranda felt even starker. She wished, not for the first time, that she had someone to share this time with—another soul trapped indoors by the weather, whispering secrets and sharing the simple pleasure of a warm drink on a cold day. But her friends had all moved on from this little town, and she remained.

A loud clap of thunder shook the house, and Miranda started. She counted the seconds until the lightning flashed—one-one thousand, two one-thousand, three—and saw the bolt crackle across the sky. The storm was right overhead. Her phone buzzed on the table, rattling against the wood, and she picked it up to see a message from her mother in the kitchen: Come start the fire, it's getting chilly. 

Miranda stood and stretched, her joints stiff from sitting too long, and headed to join her mother. The storm raged on outside, but here in the kitchen, filling the woodstove with kindling and firewood in preparation for chocolate chip cookies, Miranda felt the melancholy begin to lift. She was still trapped indoors, still isolated—but she didn't have to weather the storm alone. The rain pounded on, but inside there was warmth and comfort. Perhaps, Miranda thought, the rain didn't have to mean solitude—not if she had companionship to share it with. The rain could wash the world anew, leaving behind puddles to splash in and the smell of wet grass, if only she had someone with whom to dance under its rhythm. She smiled, and lit a match.
