The chains clanked as I strained against them, the cold iron biting into my wrists. I peered through the bars of my dungeon cell at the guard, his armor glinting in the torchlight as he strode by. His footsteps echoed down the stone corridor, faint notes of an uplifting melody trailing after him.

Music was power in this world. The melodious tones of pop singers could enchant crowds and sway opinions. The driving beats of electronic music were used to motivate armies. And the complex harmonies of classical composers were the favorite tool of rulers to demonstrate their might.

But my music, the distorted growls and frenetic blast beats of Scandinavian death metal, that was a power they feared. The last gasps of a dying art, they called it. An offensive relic of a bygone age. But to me, it was the music of defiance, of rebellion against tyranny. It was the music of freedom.  

As the guard's footsteps faded, I took a deep breath and unleashed a guttural scream, letting the metallic music flow through me. The walls of my cell vibrated with the sound, dust crumbling from the stones. I sang of the old gods of the North, their names like a battle cry. I sang of the wild lands of my home, now tamed and manicured under the rule of the melodious elite.   

The guard came running back, armor rattling, his own timid melody barely audible over my thundering song. “Stop that at once!” he cried, but I only screamed louder, the ancient rage and sorrow pouring out of me. The guard fumbled with his keys, hands shaking as he tried to find the one to my cell. 

My song shook the very foundations of the dungeon, cracks spidering across the walls and ceiling as blocks of stone tumbled down. The guard dropped his keys and fled, my mad music chasing after him. The cell crumbled around me and I emerged into the corridor, clouds of dust swirling. 

The old magic was awakened, and would not be silenced again. My song rolled through the kingdom like thunder, waking the wildness that still remained in this land of syrupy ballads. The revolution had begun, and it would have a killer tune. The age of death metal was upon us once more.
