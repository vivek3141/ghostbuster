I had always believed in magic. As a little girl, I was enchanted by fairy tales of witches and wizards, spells and potions. On my eighth birthday, I was convinced I had finally discovered my own magical powers. I recited an incantation from my favorite storybook and waved my wand over the tiny garden snail making its way across the patio. I waited with bated breath, expecting it to suddenly grow wings and take flight.  

Nothing happened. The snail inched on, oblivious. I tried again, more emphatically this time. Still no magic. My heart sank as the realization hit meâ€”there was no such thing as real magic. It was all make-believe. 

Crushed, I went inside and cried on my mother's lap. She held me tight and stroked my hair. "I know you're disappointed, darling," she said gently. "But even though there may not be magic wands or fairies, there is still so much wonder and beauty in the world. You just have to open your eyes to see the magic in simple things."

I peered out the window at the snail, still slowly making its way. And I began to understand the magic was not in some unrealistic fantasy, but in embracing life's small mysteries and adventures, even in the ordinary. My belief in magic was transformed that day into a deeper appreciation for the real.
