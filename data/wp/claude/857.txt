The Bombing of Trend Central 

Trend Central was the hottest new bar in Times Square, known for its extravagant cocktails and an interior straight out of an Instagram influencer’s dream. On a busy Saturday night, every table was filled with groups of friends laughing and chatting over drinks with names like “Cloud Nine” and “Unicorn Sparkle.”

Suddenly a blast shook the bar, shattering bottles and sending patrons diving under tables. As the dust settled, the damage was apparent. The ornate marble bar top was cracked down the middle, stools were overturned, and shards of glass covered the floor. Luckily most people escaped with only minor cuts and bruises, though the wall of liquor bottles behind the bar was now mostly empty space.

Within minutes police and firefighters arrived on the scene. While investigating the source of the explosion, they were startled by a phone call from someone claiming to be from Alcoholics Anonymous, taking responsibility for the bombing.  

“We wanted to send a message that places promoting excessive alcohol consumption will not be tolerated. Your so-called trendy watering holes are no less predatory than the seedy bars we usually associate with alcoholism. You have been warned. There will be no more bombings if all bars in Times Square are shut down within the week.”

The phone call ended abruptly. The police were stunned. Alcoholics Anonymous was supposed to be a harmless support group, not domestic terrorists issuing threats. Yet they had to take the threat seriously given what had just occurred. 

As emergency responders continued to assist the injured, police wondered how a nonprofit dedicated to helping people recover from alcoholism could resort to such extreme violent measures. And they worried this might just be the first attack of many by the radical group if their demands were not met. Times Square, usually neon bright even at midnight, was now flashing red and blue. A trendy bar became a bomb site, and nothing in New York City nightlife felt safe anymore.
