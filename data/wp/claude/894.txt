Some people collect stamps. Others, coins. You collect something far stranger.  

You have always been fascinated by lost things. As a child, you would scour the beach for mismatched flip flops, broken sunglasses, and discarded toys, imagining how they came to be abandoned. You started keeping a few of the items that spoke to you, that had a story to tell.  

Over time, your collection grew. You frequented thrift stores and yard sales, on the hunt for orphaned objects in need of a home. You curated your collection carefully, only keeping items that resonated with you. An antique locket with no pictures inside. A teddy bear missing an eye. A single roller skate, the mate long gone.

Friends and family worried about your peculiar hobby. But you saw beauty in the discarded and forgotten. Each item was a mystery, a glimpse into someone elseâ€™s memories and a story left unfinished.  

Your home became a sanctuary for the abandoned and broken. You meticulously cataloged and cared for each new addition to your collection. At night you would sit with the objects one by one, polishing a tarnished locket or darning a hole in a moth-eaten scarf, and imagine where they came from and who their owners might have been. 

Most people collect things that are whole and precious. But you collect broken bits of other lives, piecing them together through clues left behind in wear and tear. Your strange collection of abandoned ephemera has become its own tribute to lives lived and memories made. Each object a relic of a story that will now remain forever unfinished.
