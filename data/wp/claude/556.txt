Yesterday Jack and Jill went up the hill 
To fetch a pail of water.
As Jack bent down to fill the pail, 
Jill gazed at the sunset, a fiery ball 
Slowly dipping behind the hills.
The valley was cast in a golden glow
As a soft twilight descended.

"Hurry Jack, let's head back home. 
Darkness will be upon us soon."
Jack filled the pail and they started down.
But the path was rocky and uneven ground.
Jack slipped and tumbled with a cry.
The pail flew from his hands and spilled,
Rolling down into the ravine below.

"Are you hurt?" Cried Jill in alarm.
"I've twisted my ankle, I can't walk."
Jack grimaced, clutching his foot in pain.
Jill looked around in the fading light
But could see no other soul in sight.
"I'll have to go get help" she said 
And hurried off down the winding path.

The woods grew dark, the trees loomed high.
Jill walked as quick as her feet could fly.
But the path went on and on ahead.
Fear started creeping into her head.
She had never been out this late alone 
And now was lost and chilled to the bone.

At last she saw a light in the distance,
A lamp shining in a farmhouse window. 
Jill knocked on the door with all her might 
And told the farmer of Jack's plight.
He gathered men with lanterns bright
And a wagon to travel in the night.

They searched the hill but couldn't find 
A trace of Jack, who'd been left behind.
They called and searched for hours in vain.
But only silence came in refrain.
At dawn, a grim discovery was made.
There, at the bottom of the ravine
Were Jack and Jill, their bodies broken, cold.
The pail lay shattered beside them, wooden boards old.
And so the story ends of Jack and Jill
Who went up the hill their pail to fill.
