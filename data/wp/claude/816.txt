The Impossible Exists 

By every law of physics what he saw in front of his eyes should be impossible, yet there it was, existing.

Mark blinked again but the strange sight before him remained. It was a doorway, framed by an old stone archway, standing in the middle of his backyard. But through the doorway was not his familiar yard but instead a lush, tropical jungle.

He walked around the archway but it seemed completely disconnected from any other structure. It was just standing there, a portal to someplace else. His logical mind struggled with it. It violated every known law of physics. Solid stone archways did not just appear in empty space, and they did not contain views of rainforests. 

Yet his senses told him it was real. He could feel the warm, damp air coming through the portal, smell the earthy scents of the jungle, and hear the cries of exotic birds in the distance.

His heart racing, Mark considered the possibilities. If it defied physics, perhaps it was a trick, an illusion of some kind. But what if it was real? What if this impossible thing could take him to an unexplored world, full of mystery and wonder?

The scientist in him warned that it couldnâ€™t be real. But the explorer in him longed for the chance to pass through to the other side. He knew he may never again have an opportunity like this, to discover something so implausible yet so full of promise. 

His mind made up, Mark steeled his nerves. He took a deep breath and stepped through the archway, leaving behind the familiar world where he knew - or thought he knew - what was possible and impossible. On the other side of the archway, the impossible was real. A new world of discovery awaited, if only he was willing to believe in it.
