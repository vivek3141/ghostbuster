We were about 4 hours into the 8 hour drive to Grandma's house for the holidays. My brother and I were bickering in the backseat as  usual while my parents listened to Christmas music, oblivious. 

Suddenly, a bright light flashed in the distance, followed by a loud explosion. A massive fireball rose up from behind the hills ahead of us. "Is that...a nuclear bomb?" my dad asked incredulously. 

We stared in stunned silence as the mushroom cloud billowed up, confirming our worst fears. This was it. We were all going to die, vaporized in an instant on this lonely highway.

In a panic, I blurted out "I'm sorry for all the times I was mean to you!" to my brother. He replied "And I'm sorry for putting gum in your hair that one time!" My parents looked at each other and held hands tightly. "I love you both so much," my mom said through tears. 

We braced for the blast wave to hit...but nothing happened. The fire raged on but no shock wave came. We hadn't been bombed.  We started laughing in relief and then awkwardness as we realized the confessions and last words we had hastily shared. 

The next four hours of driving were spent in an uncomfortable silence. My hasty declaration of sibling love sat uncomfortably between us, never to be spoken of again. When we arrived at Grandma's, we were all too eager to get out of that car. Most awkward family road trip ever.
