The old scout ship cruised through the inky black void of space. Korin monitored the sensors, looking for something—anything—that might lead them to signs of life. 

It had been over 3000 years since the two colony ships escaped the destruction of Earth and landed on separate worlds with the hope of preserving humanity. But shortly after settling Nova Prime and Horizon, all contact was lost between the colonies. Until today.

Korin's instruments detected a faint signal in the distance. "Commander, I'm picking up an artificial transmission. It's an old Earth code."

The commander peered over Korin's shoulder at the readout. "Can you translate it?"

"Decoding now...it says 'This is Horizon Colony. Our long range sensors have detected your ship. Do you read us?'"

The commander felt her heart leap. "Open a channel and send this reply: 'This is Scout Ship Skylark from Nova Prime Colony. We read you, Horizon. After 3000 years, we are overjoyed to have found you.'"

A few minutes later a response came through. "Skylark, this is Horizon Colony. We detected your colony ship's original distress call those many years ago, but lost contact shortly after. We are relieved to know our long lost sisters and brothers survived. You are most welcome to visit our world."

The commander smiled, her eyes glistening with tears of joy. "Set a course for Horizon immediately."

Three days later, Skylark entered Horizon's star system. A lush, Earth-like world came into view, bathed in the light of a yellow sun. As the ship orbited the planet, they received landing coordinates from the Horizon colonists below.

When Skylark's engines powered down and the exit ramp extended, the commander walked out slowly with her crew behind her. At the bottom of the ramp stood a group of people. A tall woman with light mocha skin stepped forward, her smile radiant. 

"Welcome to our world, brothers and sisters of Nova Prime." The commander approached and grasped the woman's hands tenderly. "I am Commander Lyra of Horizon Colony."

"I'm Commander Tera of Nova Prime Colony," she replied. They stood silently for a moment, hands clasped, sharing an unspoken connection across the vast depths of time and space that had once separated them.

In that moment, two branches of humanity became whole again. The long years of isolation melted away as each looked into the face of their lost kin, found at last among the stars.
