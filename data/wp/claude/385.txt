The scout ships landed silently on the edges of major cities. They revealed themselves, displaying holographic messages of peace and an invitation. After shock and suspicion, world leaders agreed to meet the alien delegates.

They were a Federation of species, and they brought an offer of membership. In exchange for access to advanced technology and trade, the Federation asked we join them in promoting peace across worlds. Earth governments saw little choice but to join.

Ambassadors from Earth traveled through gates to the Federation capital. Here species from across the galaxy mingled, diverse in form yet sharing a commitment to peace. Earth took its place among them.

As Earth's representatives built connections, they came to learn more about the Federation's assessment of worlds. Planets were ranked based on environmental hostility. To their shock, Earth was marked as a "Death World"â€”its climate, geology, and biology deadly to most known life.

Our toxic air, crushing gravity, and violent weather were lethal to most Federation species. Our microbes alone could unleash plagues. It dawned on us why so few Federation members had openly visited Earth. Why invitations for long stays on Federation worlds were refused.

We thought ourselves opening a door to the stars, but instead found ourselves quarantined. Our Death World status an ominous threat to our interstellar neighbors. The dangers that shaped humanity into resilient survivors marked Earth as a perilous cage, one that both empowered and imprisoned us. Our membership a balancing act between opportunity and isolation. The Death World could forge alliances, yet never true kinship.

Always alone in the universe that made us.
