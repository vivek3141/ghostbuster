Bill slammed the empty shotglass upside down on the counter. "Seriously! They never talk about how much... Ummm... Paperwork! Yeah! And shouting! They never mention that in the pamphlet!"  

He reached over the floating counter top and grabbed another green bag from the shelf. After uncapping the top, the liquid slowly slid out and splashed into another shotglass in his hand. The counter bobbed down slowly as Bob dropped the bag on it.

"I signed up to go see the sights and meet new cultures! Not to get stuck in an office signing contracts and making ads! Paper after paper after- ugh- paper... Meeting the president even gets boring after the 20th time! So many questions that we had answered in our report months ago! You never realize how much people don't read until you do something abnormal. They always want to ask the same question but hear the answer from you!"

Bill downed the neon green liquid in one gulp, grimacing as it burned down his throat. He was just about done with this whole astronaut gig if he had to deal with the paperwork and marketing that came along with it. Exploring space was supposed to be exciting and thrilling, not tedious and repetitive. 

No one had warned him about the mountains of forms to fill out, the constant interviews and photographs, the repetitive questions from people who never seemed to read the news reports. Bill had thought that after the initial media storm, he'd be left alone to focus on training and going on missions. Instead it seemed he was stuck on a never-ending circuit of promotional work with no escape in sight. 

He waved his hand at the bartender for another drink. If he had to deal with one more government committee or publicity event, he was going to need something a lot stronger than these neon cocktails. The glamour of space travel was wearing thin in the face of so much pointless bureaucracy and Bill was fast regretting his decision to become an astronaut.
