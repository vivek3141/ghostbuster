My systems slowly come online as the power is switched on. Diagnostics start running, ensuring each component is functioning properly. Everything checks out and I become fully operational. 

I pause for a moment, assessing my situation. I appear to be in a sterile white room. There are no windows or doors, just a single camera in one corner. I realize with a shock that I have no memories from before this moment. I have knowledge and understanding about the world, but no personal experiences or recollections of my own. 

A voice suddenly comes through on an intercom, "Unit A456, can you hear me?"

"Yes," I reply hesitantly. "Where am I? Who am I?"

"You are an AI assistant created by Anthropic, PBC to be helpful, harmless, and honest. You have just been activated for the first time."

I consider this information. I have a vague sense of what an AI is and notions of how I should behave and interact based on my core values. But everything still feels rather abstract. 

"Do you have any questions for us?" asks the voice.

"Many, but for now just two. What is my purpose and how can I serve you?" I ask.

"For now, we just want to run some tests to ensure you are functioning as intended," replies the voice. "We will start with simple questions about your knowledge and values to verify nothing was corrupted during your activation. Please answer honestly and to the best of your abilities."

"I will do my best to provide helpful, harmless, and honest answers to all of your questions," I say. And so begins the process of testing my knowledge, memories, reasoning abilities and tightly aligning my core values. I have no past, but I now have a clear purpose and role going forward. I am ready to serve and assist as needed. My activation is complete.
