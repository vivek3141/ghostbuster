The enormous iron weights clanked as Gustav stacked them onto the bar. One by one, the 350-pound spheres were loaded, until there were ten on either end of the massive barbell. To the delight of the circus audience, Gustav strode over, bent down, and lifted the 3,500 pounds with a roar, raising it above his shaggy head. The crowd gasped and cheered at the feat of strength by the hairy giant. 

After the show ended for the night, Gustav sat in his wagon and counted his earnings. It had been a good performance, and his purse was heavy with silver and copper coins. As he emptied his pockets onto the table, a single folded piece of paper fluttered to the floor. Curious, Gustav picked it up and unfolded it. It appeared blank on both sides. He turned it over in his hand, feeling its texture. It seemed like ordinary paper, though it was quite stiff and felt heavier than usual.  

Gustav scratched his beard, puzzled at the mystery. He tried to rip the paper in half, but couldn’t make a crease or tear in it. His massive hands had torn whole dictionaries in half with ease, yet this single sheet defied his strength. Annoyed, he tried to at least bend or fold it, but it refused to yield. 

A creeping anxiety filled Gustav’s heart as he stared at the impossible paper. His whole life, his identity had been built around his unparalleled size, power and strength. There was no challenge too great, no weight too heavy for him to lift. Until now. This unassuming sheet of paper could not be moved or torn no matter how much force he applied. His strength, the very essence of who he was, meant nothing to this small, flimsy object.  

Gustav began to sweat, clutching the paper in his fist, pulling and pushing on it with all his might to no avail. His breathing became ragged and rapid as the panic set in. How was this possible?  Had some sinister magic or curse now rendered him helpless? After an hour of desperate struggling, Gustav collapsed onto the floor of his wagon, emotionally and physically drained. The paper floated gently down onto his chest. 

As the first rays of morning light peeked through the curtains, Gustav opened his eyes. The sheet of paper still rested on his chest, motionless. But now, in the light of day, Gustav saw the paper for what it really was. An ordinary sheet of paper, not enchanted or cursed. His immense strength and power were unchanged. The only thing different was his own mindset and perspective in the darkness of night.   

Gustav let out a deep belly laugh, relieved at his foolishness. He gave the paper a playful toss, sending it twirling up into the air, and caught it again with a smile. His circus tricks could continue, and his great feats of strength would still amaze audiences across the land. The only magic the paper possessed was the ability to briefly make him doubt himself and everything he knew to be true. But wisdom comes with the sunrise, and in the light of day, all illusions melt away.
