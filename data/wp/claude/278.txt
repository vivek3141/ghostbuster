The Perfect Son

By the Assistant

I watched with pride as my son, Josh, gave his valedictorian speech. My perfect, gifted child, graduating at the top of his class. We had sacrificed so much for his success. His opportunity was unlimited. 

After the ceremony, I found Josh talking with that girl, Amy, again. I had warned him she would distract him from his goals. "Aren't you coming to take photos with the family?" I called out. He said goodbye and raced over, all smiles. I hugged him, overjoyed at his achievements.

At the reception, Josh's uncle slipped him an envelope. "A little something for your college fund." Josh's smile faded as he opened it. "Only a hundred dollars? I was hoping for more from family." I squeezed his arm, holding back my anger. His uncle had no right to make Josh feel undeserving. 

"Forget about your uncle," I said. "This day is about you and your bright future." Josh grinned, mood lifting as quickly as it fell. My boy was so easily influenced. I would have to be vigilant in guiding him.

We arrived at the university a week later. The campus was imposing, full of dangerous distractions. While Josh went to orientation, I unpacked for him. He'd always been scatterbrained; I was doing him a favor. 

I went to the bookstore and ran into Amy and her mother. I frowned, wishing they weren't attending here too. Amy's mother gave me a cursory hello. "We haven't seen Josh yet. Amy was hoping to catch up with him."

"He's been very busy," I said, clutching his new notebooks to my chest. "I'm not sure if he'll have time for friends this year." Her mouth formed a grim line as I walked away.

That evening, I brought groceries to stock Josh's mini-fridge, planning to cook him dinner. He stumbled into the dorm, laughing with a group of new friends. My annoyance grew; I'd told him to be wary of strangers. 

One boy extended his hand. "I'm Asher. Congrats on the killer room!"Josh beamed, shaking hands eagerly. "Thanks! My mom set it up." The boys glanced at me oddly. 

"We were headed to grab pizza before the dorm event," Asher said. "Want to come?" 

Josh looked torn, gaze flickering to the groceries. "Go ahead," I said, though my blood boiled. I had slaved over a hot stove for him. "Have fun with your friends."

"Really?" Josh asked. I swallowed my anger and forced a smile. He thanked me and left with his new friends. I sank into his desk chair, surveying the room I had lovingly prepared. My son was slipping away already. I couldn't let that happen. I had given up everything to get him here. He owed me this. I had to remain in control. 

After all, what kind of mother would I be if I didn't guide my son to fulfill his destiny? His future was too important to be left up to chance. I had to keep steering him towards the correct path, no matter the cost. My Josh was meant for greatness. And I would do whatever it took to make sure he achieved it.
