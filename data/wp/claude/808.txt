The cold stone walls of my cell have been my home for over 60 years now. The world outside has changed so much, yet in here time stands still. Except for me.

I have been careful to age my appearance over the decades to match what a normal human lifespan should entail. A graying of the hair here, a wrinkle added there. It's a tedious masquerade but necessary to maintain. The prison guards aren't the most observant bunch but even they would notice if an inmate didn't age a day in over half a century. 

A few times, my ruse was almost discovered. A sharper guard noticed my surprisingly few liver spots for a man in his 70s. A nurse questioned why my skin had so few wrinkles. But with some hastily crafted lies and forgeries in the prison records, I was able to deflect their curiosity and remain undisturbed.

Today the warden himself came to visit my cell. "Inmate #13, you've been here longer than any other, did you know that?" he asked. My heart raced. After so long avoiding suspicion, has my time finally come? 

I smiled and said, "When you're serving a life sentence, the days tend to blur together." The warden paused, eyeing me carefully up and down. I started contemplating how I would fake my own death and escape to avoid exposure.

But then he smiled and chuckled. "I suppose that's true. Well, I just wanted to personally thank you. You've been a model inmate and caused us no trouble. That's more than I can say for most of the rapscallions in here. Keep it up."

As the warden walked off, I sighed in relief. My secret is still safe. I will remain hiding in plain sight, an immortal killer caged for eternity yet undetected. The perfect victim and the perfect disguise in one - a prisoner who will never die. My sinister masquerade continues.
