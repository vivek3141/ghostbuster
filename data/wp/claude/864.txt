The icy wind swept over the frozen lake as Halvar Ragnorsson trudged through the snow toward the Whipwarts School of Magic. His thick woolen cloak did little to shield him from the biting cold of the Swedish winter. 

Halvar was an orphan, abandoned as a baby on the steps of a church in Stockholm. For the first 11 years of his life, he lived in misery with his cruel aunt and uncle, unaware of the magical gifts he possessed. That all changed with the arrival of a letter in flowing calligraphy, sealed with the crest of Whipwarts - a dragon entwined around a whip. Halvar was a wizard, and had been accepted into the prestigious school of magic.

His aunt and uncle reluctantly took him to the hidden train station at Platform Sju-Elva, where Halvar boarded the enchanted train bound for Whipwarts Castle. On the journey, Halvar met his new friends - the mischievous Jakob Weasleby and the brilliant but prickly Hedda Granger.

At Whipwarts, the first years were sorted into the school's houses - Thunder Crow, Ice Bear, Snow Wolf and Fire Drake - by the tattered old Whip Choosing Hat. To Halvar's relief, he was chosen to join Ice Bear house.

Halvar showed a natural talent with the whip, especially at Whip Fighting class under the tutelage of Professor Måns Månson. But there were rumors at Whipwarts of the dark wizard Valdemark, who some believed was responsible for Halvar becoming an orphan as a baby.

With his friends Jakob and Hedda, Halvar began to investigate the mystery of his past. After a harrowing encounter with Valdemark in the forbidden Whipwarts dungeons, Halvar learned the truth - that he was the only wizard ever to survive Valdemark's deadly curse, leaving him with the lightning-shaped scar on his forehead.

Halvar realized his destiny was to defeat Valdemark. Armed with his whip and his ability to conjure a Patronus in the form of a reindeer, Halvar faced Valdemark in a climactic duel. With a slash of his whip, Halvar finally defeated the dark wizard who had inflicted so much suffering, avenging his parents' deaths and restoring peace to the magical world. And so began the legend of Halvar Ragnorsson, The Boy Who Whipped.
