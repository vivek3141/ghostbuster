The streets were packed as Jenny shoved her way through the crowds. She only had a few more months until her 18th birthday, and she was determined to take advantage of the time she had left. 

In the year 2137, the world population had swelled to over 15 billion people. Massive overpopulation and resource scarcity had plunged much of the world into chaos and poverty. In a desperate attempt to curb growth, most developed nations had instituted a radical new population control policy: all crime and debauchery was legal until age 18. On your 18th birthday, you were expected to enroll in mandatory birth control and begin your government job assignment.

Jenny strode down the alleyway towards her favorite drug den. As a 17-year-old, she could do whatever she wanted in the anarchist playground this world had become. She walked up to the counter and ordered her usual cocktail of psychedelics and stimulants. The grizzled bartender handed her the pills wordlessly; he still had a few months left himself before aging out of freedom.

Swallowing her pills, Jenny stumbled out of the den and made her way to an underground nightclub. The pounding music matched the pounding in her head as the drugs started to take effect. Bodies pressed in around her, young and carefree. This was her tribe, the ones who understood how precious the time before adulthood was.

Two days later, Jenny emerged from the club, her body aching and mind clouded but satisfied. She had met a 15-year-old boy and they had spent the past 48 hours drunk and in each other's arms. Jenny knew she would never see him againâ€”such ephemeral encounters were common in this world where nobody could make long-term plans or commitments.

Walking down the street, Jenny passed a gang of 14-year-old girls mugging an older man. She shook her head, remembering when she was that age and how desperate she had been to prove herself in the urban jungle her city had become.
For their 18th birthdays, the government would give these girls contraceptive implants and ship  them off to work in factories or on massive government agriculture tracts. But for now, they reveled in their freedom and the opportunity to prey upon those older and weaker than themselves.

Jenny walked up to her family's cramped apartment, as nondescript and run-down as all the others in her block. Most family units had long since dissolved, unable to handle the pressures of this harsh world. But Jenny's parents had stayed together, a small miracle she was grateful for.
They were conservatives who disapproved of the lawlessness in the streets but were powerless to shelter their daughter from it before she came of age.

Her mother embraced her as she walked in. "I was worried about you," she said. "Only a few months left. I'm glad you came back to us this time."

Jenny nodded, a lump forming in her throat. She knew her mother was right. Though the debauched life of the streets called to her, she belonged here with the people who had loved and raised her. She would soon age out of the anarchy and into adulthood, but at least she would have a family waiting for her on the other side. 

The government may control their futures, but it could not break the bonds of family. For that, Jenny was eternally grateful. She hugged her mother tight, clinging to her as a bulwark against the chaos outside and the uncertainty that awaited. Childhood was fleeting, but they would always have each other. For now, that was enough.
