The searing pain in my chest slowly faded as I floated up and out of my body. I looked down in disbelief at my crumpled form on the sidewalk, a pool of blood expanding around me. A man in a black hoodie and jeans was running away, clutching a gun.

In the distance, I heard the wail of police sirens approaching. But the sounds grew muffled, as if I was sinking underwater. A warm, peaceful feeling washed over me. I was bathed in a bright, white light.

When I opened my eyes again, I was in an open carriage of an old-fashioned train, chugging through a misty landscape. The seats were filled with a motley assortment of people of all ages, races and time periods. An old conductor came by, punching tickets. "Welcome aboard the Train to Heaven, son," he said with a tip of his cap. I realized with a shock that this must be what they called the afterlife.

A few minutes later, a new passenger stumbled into the carriage, looking around frantically. It was the man in the black hoodie, my killer. Our eyes locked, and we both froze. The other passengers looked on curiously.

My first instinct was anger. This man had ruthlessly cut my life short. He deserved punishment. But a calmness rose within me as I stared at him. His eyes were filled not with malice but confusion and fear.

He slumped into the seat opposite me. "I'm sorry," he said hoarsely. "I didn't want to do it. But they were going to kill my family if I didn't." I saw then that there were shadows under his eyes and a deep sorrow within them.

I took a deep breath and let go of my anger and resentment. "I forgive you," I said. He looked at me in disbelief. His eyes welled up with tears. In that moment, I saw his humanity, and he saw mine. We were just two men, caught in circumstances beyond our control.

The old conductor came by again. This time, he took the man's ticket and punched a hole in it. "Last stop coming up ahead, son," he said gently. "Time for you to cross over." 

The man turned to me. "Thank you," he said. His voice trembled. "I can finally be at peace." He got up as the train slowed to a stop. I watched through the window as he made his way across a sunlit field into a forest beyond. At the edge of the forest, he turned back one last time and raised his hand in farewell. I placed my hand on the window, and knew then that while his path was ending, mine was just beginning. The train whistled and chugged on.
