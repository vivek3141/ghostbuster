The old house creaked as the wind shook the shutters. Mark lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, unable to sleep. His parents had told him there was nothing to be afraid of in the dark, that his imagination was playing tricks on him. But he knew the sounds were real. 

Down the hall, his little sister Emma was fast asleep in her crib. She didn't stir as a floorboard in the attic groaned above her room. Mark thought of going to check on her but fear paralyzed him. He was supposed to be the man of the house while his father was away on business. He had promised to protect Emma. But he couldn't even protect himself.

As midnight approached, the noises grew louder. There were knocks in the walls, scrapes from the basement below, hoarse whispers around corners just out of sight.  His heart racing, Mark clutched his blankets tight around him. The familiar surroundings of his room transformed into a threatening maze of shadows. 

In the early hours of the morning, Mark finally drifted off into a fitful sleep. He dreamt of strange figures gathering around Emma's crib, touching her cheeks with gnarled fingers, grasping at her with pale hands that grinned with pointed fingernails. She giggled softly at the monsters, not understanding the danger. But Mark understood. He tried to run to her but couldn't move. 

Mark awoke with a start to bright sunlight filtering through the curtains. The familiar sounds of the morning—his mother making breakfast downstairs, a dog barking outside, Emma gurgling happily in the next room—comforted him. Still, a feeling of dread lingered. A sense that the monsters had retreated into hiding with the daylight, waiting for the shroud of night to fall again.

His parents didn't believe him, of course. They said his fears were the product of an active imagination and too many scary stories. Grown-ups knew the difference between fantasy and reality. They weren't afraid of the dark anymore. 

Mark knew better. He knew that adults only pretended not to believe so that children would go to sleep. The truth was, they had simply learned to ignore the ominous sounds, to sleep through the terrors of the night. But the monsters were still there. Adults had just gotten very good at pretending otherwise. Mark promised himself he would never become that adept at self-deception. He refused to forget that evil didn't disappear with the coming of the light. It simply waited, ever patient, for darkness to fall again.
