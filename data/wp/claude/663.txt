I sighed as I walked into the Hall of Heroes. All of the other superheroes were already there, showing off as usual. Laser eyes was demonstrating his laser beam vision by welding a metal bar, Super strength was lifting a bus over his head, and Invisibility woman had disappeared again.  

As I entered, a few of them snickered. My "power" was rather useless compared to the rest. All I could do was glow in the dark. I couldn't fly or lift heavy objects or turn invisible. I was just Glowworm, the human nightlight.

We took our seats as the city's mayor came in. "Heroes, we have an emergency situation. The city's power plant has been hacked into by the supervillain Technomancer. He's seized control of the plant and shut it down. The entire city will be in blackout in 30 minutes unless we can get in there and stop him."

The other superheroes stood up, ready to take action with their amazing abilities. I started to stand up but Laser eyes put his hand on my shoulder and shoved me back into my seat. "Sit down, Glowworm. This is a job for real superheroes. You'd just get in the way."  

They flew off leaving me behind. I felt dejected. Maybe my power really was useless. But then I thought of the city, about to go dark. I had to at least try to help, even if the others didn't think I could.   

I hitched a ride to the power plant, sneaking in a side entrance the others had left unguarded. Everything was pitch black inside - Technomancer had already killed the backup generators. I took a deep breath and concentrated, activating my power. My skin began to glow brightly, lighting up the dark room.  

I carefully made my way through the plant, dodging parked forklifts and tripping over cords. Finally I found Technomancer cackling at a bank of computers. He hadn't noticed my glow in his frenzy. 

I looked around desperately, trying to figure out a way to stop him. Aha! The main circuit breaker was just within reach. As Technomancer entered another command, I lunged forward and flipped the breaker, shutting down the whole system.  

The emergency lights flickered on as Technomancer realized what had happened. He turned around and gaped, seeing me glowing behind him.  

I grinned. "Lights out, Technomancer." 

The other superheroes arrived a moment later, shocked to find I had already saved the day. Laser Eyes stammered an apology as I walked out of the power plant. My useless power had come in handy after all. The city was safe thanks to Glowworm, the human nightlight.
