I couldn't believe it was happening. The alerts on my phone kept pinging as news reports of strange attacks came in from around the city. People were biting and scratching others in a crazed frenzy. My co-workers were in a panic, looking to me for answers. 

Last year I had written up a tongue-in-cheek “Zombie Apocalypse Plan” for our office as part of mandatory disaster preparedness training. Now they wanted to put that plan into action. I protested that it was just a joke, hardly an actual strategy for survival. But fear and adrenaline were taking over.  

We barricaded the stairwells and grabbed anything that could be used as a weapon - staplers, laptops, coat racks. A few brave souls ventured outside to get emergency supplies. They returned with food, water,  flashlights and a battery-powered radio. 

Reports were coming in from other cities of hospitals being overrun, mass chaos, a breakdown in services. This was really happening. We were on our own.

Night fell and an uneasy dread sat over the office. No one slept. We listened to the moans and howls outside, hoping the flimsy barricades would hold. I regretted ever writing that ridiculous plan. What sounded amusing in theory became a terrifying reality I was now responsible for navigating. My silly idea may have doomed us all. As the sounds outside intensified, we steeled ourselves for the long night ahead, realizing with dread that this was only the first of many. The zombies were here.
