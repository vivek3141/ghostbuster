The two greatest swordsmen in the world cross blades. The duel ends in a single move.  

Master Kozū and Grandmaster Hon were bitter rivals. For decades, philosophers and martial artists debated who was the superior swordsman. Their fame was known across the continent, and young students would flock to their schools, hoping to learn from the legends.

As the years passed, tensions mounted between Kozū and Hon's followers. Insults were traded, challenges issued, but Kozū and Hon themselves remained silent. They were beyond such petty quarrels and focused on perfecting their art. 

One moonless night, two figures met in a bamboo grove. They bowed deeply, wooden swords in hand. The time for talk was over. The debate would be settled in steel.

Kozū adopted an orthodox two-handed grip. He sank into a low stance, ready to unleash a torrent of cuts. His style focused on aggression and relentless pressure.  

Hon held his sword lightly in one hand, almost casually. He remained upright, his feet barely apart. His style emphasized economy of motion and effortless control. 

For a long minute, they waited. The grove was utterly silent.

Kozū attacked first, sweeping his sword upward. But Hon had already drawn and cut, his blade tracing a shallow arc. They froze. 

Kozū coughed. A thin line of blood appeared across his chest, soaking into his kimono. 

Hon flicked his wrist, casting a few droplets of blood from his sword, and smiled. "It seems speed is the more essential virtue," he said.

Kozū nodded once, sheathed his sword, and departed without another word. His disciples would find his body the next morning, a single wound over the heart, a poem and farewell message placed before it.

The debate was settled at last. Hon had surpassed his rival and proved himself the greatest swordsman the world had known. His fame spread even farther, and warriors traveled great distances for a chance to cross blades, even if just for a moment, with the master who ended a duel with a single, peerless cut.
