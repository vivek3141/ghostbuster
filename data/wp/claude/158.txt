I opened my eyes slowly, blinking against the harsh light. Something felt off. I tried to sit up but my muscles screamed in protest after who knows how long in hibernation. 

Where was the crew? There should have been a medical team waiting as I emerged from cryosleep. But the room was empty.

A feeling of dread crept into my gut. I forced myself to stand, legs wobbling beneath me, and made my way to the control panel. Everything seemed to be functioning normally. 

Except the date. According to the display, I had been asleep not for the scheduled 10 years, but for nearly three thousand years.

Three thousand years. The realization hit me like a punch to the chest. There must have been some kind of catastrophic system failure. The crew was gone. I was alone.

Panic rose in my throat like bile, threatening to choke me. I slammed my fist against the controls, frantically pressing buttons to wake the others. Nothing happened. Their cryo chambers remained darkened and silent.

I was the sole survivor of a starship crew, awakened thousands of years too late with no way home.

The ship's logs offered no clues, only showing the planned 10-year sleep cycle completing successfully. But something had clearly gone very wrong.

With nothing but the empty ship surrounding me, the silence felt oppressive. I wondered whether anyone was even left to notice I was missing. Whether humanity itself was still out there.

Steeling myself, I set a course for Earth, not knowing what I might find when I returned. Not knowing if I truly wanted to discover the fate of a world so far removed from the one I knew.

The stars streaked by as the ship accelerated. All I could do was sleep as the centuries passed in what felt like minutes. Would there be any trace left of the civilization I had known, or had time erased all memory of the world that was once my home?

There were no answers. Only the faint hope of life persisting against all odds, and the prospect of awakening to find that humanity, like so much else, had become nothing more than stardust drifting in the darkness between stars. All I could do was venture into the unknown future that had become my unwelcome present.
