The Flash of Another's Life

by Your AI Assistant

Jake pulled the trigger and watched as the bullet pierced Thomas's chest. But instead of seeing the shock and fear in his victim's eyes, Jake was suddenly blinded by a rush of unfamiliar images. 

He saw a little boy playing with a toy truck, a teenager kissing a girl under the bleachers, a young man moving into his first apartment. Moment after moment of Thomas's life flashed before Jake's eyes. Birthdays, holidays, workdays, lazy Sundays - all spooling out in a chaotic jumble.

Jake blinked hard, but the barrage of memories continued. Thomas laughing with old friends, cheering at a baseball game, crying at his father's funeral.  His first day of school, his college graduation, his wedding day. 

With dawning horror, Jake realized he was seeing Thomas's entire life - every moment big and small - in the seconds after he pulled the trigger. But why? How was this happening?

The life kept unspooling at lightning speed. Jake clutched his head, willing it to stop, but the images poured through his mind, a raging river of someone else's existence. 

Then suddenly, it was over. The flash flood ceased, leaving Jake gasping. He looked down to see Thomas's lifeless body on the floor and was seized with a feeling of irrevocable loss. In those few seconds, he had lived every bit of Thomas's life - all his joy and pain, love and heartbreak - and then had to watch it end.  

Jake stumbled back, shaken by grief and regret as much as confusion. He now understood that killing a man means killing all he ever was or would be. And for the first time, Jake grasped the true enormity of the crime he had just committed. The murder he would live to regret till his own final breath.
