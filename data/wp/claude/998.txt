The old Cessna rattled as we flew over the Atlantic ocean, leaving behind the gleaming cities of Western Europe. My copilot, Jonas, checked the gauges and gave me a thumbs up. We were low on fuel but should make it to the abandoned shores of North America. 

Five years ago, the Z14 virus swept across the Americas, turning most of the population into ravenous zombies. The eastern hemisphere was able to close its borders and develop a vaccine before the infection spread. But the western half of the world was lost. Now completely devoid of human life, it had become a forbidden and dangerous place.

As an adventure journalist, I made my living taking risks to capture stories no one else would. This was the biggest risk yet, to document what remained of civilization on the other side of the world. The eastern governments claimed the zombie virus had wiped everything out in the Americas. But I had heard rumors of survivors forming small colonies, living on the knife's edge to avoid zombie hordes. I had to find out the truth.

We began our descent into New York, skyscrapers towering like steel skeletons. Jonas maneuvered us onto a crumbling runway at JFK airport, tires crunching on cracked asphalt. I grabbed my camera bag and rifle and opened the hatch. Hot, rank air rushed in.

We walked through the empty terminal, dust and debris everywhere. "It's eerie as hell," Jonas whispered. I nodded, sweeping my rifle side to side. We wandered onto the streets outside. 

A choked sound came from around the corner. I froze, holding a finger to my lips. Ever so slowly, I peeked around the edge of the building.

A zombie crouched over a desiccated corpse, gnawing on its arm. It had not noticed us yet. My heart pounding, I aimed and fired a single shot into its head. The zombie slumped without a sound.

We hurried out of the city and into the cover of overgrown suburbs. As night fell, we took shelter in an old gas station, boarding up windows and doors to secure the place. I checked my watch; we had 12 hours before needing to refuel and return across the ocean.

At dawn, we continued south, scavenging supplies in small towns along the highway. In Virginia, we finally discovered signs of life - smoke from chimneys in the distance. We approached a fenced compound in the forest with makeshift log homes and gardens. A warning shot thudded into a tree beside us. 

“Stop right there!” A guard emerged from the treeline, leveling her rifle at me. I raised my hands slowly. 

“Don’t shoot! We’re from England. I’m here to document your story.”

She hesitated, then nodded for us to come inside the gates. My heart swelled with excitement. The rumors were true. Life remained in this dead world after all.
