The alley was dark, damp, and deserted â€” the perfect place for a mugging. I leaned against the cold brick wall, clutching my knife, waiting for a victim. 

After a few minutes, a man hurried down the alley, anxiously looking at his watch. He was well-dressed, clearly affluent. A perfect target.

I jumped out, brandishing my knife. "Give me your wallet and watch, now!"

The man froze in terror. "Please, don't hurt me! Take whatever you want!" He frantically emptied his pockets, handing me his fat wallet and expensive watch.

I grinned. "Now get out of here before I change my mind!" 

He scrambled away as fast as he could. What a haul! This was turning out to be a very profitable night.

I opened the wallet to count my earnings. But inside, instead of the expected cash and credit cards, I found a single keycard and a note. 

I read the note with growing confusion and dread:

The keycard unlocks the west entrance to the central subway station. There, you will find the explosive device in locker 413. You must defuse it before detonating the other devices placed throughout the city. The lives of millions of innocent people depend on you. I sincerely apologize for deceiving you, but for the safety of the city, the ruse was necessary. You have demonstrated a capacity for moral ambiguity that suits this task. The password is 1873. Make haste, there is little time left.

My hands started to shake. A terrorist attack? This couldn't be real. But what if it was? I might be the only one who could stop it.

I raced to the central subway station, nervously swiping the keycard at the west entrance. To my surprise, the door clicked open. This was really happening.

The subway was eerily empty. I ran to locker 413, entering the password with trembling fingers. The locker clicked open. Inside was a metal case with an LED display, numbers ticking down from 10:47...10:46...

A bomb. My heart plummeted into my stomach. 

I cautiously examined the device, a tangled mess of wires, circuits and pipes surrounding blocks of a clay-like explosive I'd seen before. One wrong move could detonate the bomb. Sweat dripped down my forehead, my breath rapid and shallow. 

After a few agonizing minutes of trial and error, I managed to halt the countdown with only 3 seconds left. I exhaled in relief and exhaustion, wiping my brow with a shaking hand. The city was safe, for tonight at least, thanks to the success of my unexpected new career path: terrorist stopper. What would I do now? Defuse the other bombs, as instructed? Turn myself into the police, my mugging forgotten in light of averting catastrophe? The possibilities were as endless as the city stretching out above me, filled with millions of lives that would go on into tomorrow thanks only to the work of a single mugger in that pivotal moment when everything changed.
