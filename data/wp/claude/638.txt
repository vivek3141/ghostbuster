The old wooden door creaked open as Mark stepped into the dimly lit room. His eyes adjusted to the low light and he gazed around in disbelief. The room was small, maybe 10 feet by 10 feet, and every inch of wall space was covered in bookshelves. But instead of a variety of books, every single shelf held the same book: "How to make sure no one is reading your mind."

Mark blinked a few times, wondering if his eyes were playing tricks on him. But no, every book was identical. The spine read "How to make sure no one is reading your mind" in bold font. His curiosity got the better of him and he pulled one of the books from the shelf. He opened it to find all the pages were blank. It was a prop. 

A cold chill ran down Mark's spine as the realization hit him. This was no ordinary library. Something strange and unsettling was going on here. His heart started pounding as his mind raced. Had he stumbled upon some secret society? Was this a weird psychological experiment? Was someone watching him now?

Mark spun around, scrutinizing every corner of the room for any sign of a camera or peephole. But he couldn't see anything obvious. The walls seemed solid, and the door he entered through was the only way in or out. 

He told himself to remain calm, that there had to be a logical explanation. But that was difficult given he was in a room filled with fake books about reading minds. He wondered if it was all an elaborate hoax or trick meant to provoke an anxious reaction in whoever discovered this place. If so, it was certainly working.

Mark knew he had to get out of there. His curiosity had gotten the better of him, and now he felt like he was in danger even though there seemed to be no direct threat. As his heart pounded, he moved to the door and grasped the handle firmly. He turned it and was flooded with relief as the door opened. He hurried through and slammed it shut behind him, eager to leave that bizarre room behind.  

He took a deep breath of fresh air and leaned against the wall, waiting for his nerves to settle. The strange encounter left him rattled and full of questions about what exactly was going on behind that door. He knew one thing for sure - he would not be going back in there again. His mind raced with possibilities, but none seemed to make sense. After a few minutes, he pushed himself off the wall and walked away down the corridor, hoping to forget the unsettling incident. But he knew that room full of fake books would haunt his memory for a long time to come.
