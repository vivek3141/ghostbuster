The flames flickered in the inky black void, casting dancing shadows on the indistinct figures huddled around the campfire. They were refugees, survivors of a universe now long gone, clinging to the last remnants of light and warmth in a reality not meant for them.  

The first figure poked at the fire with a stick, sending sparks spiraling up into the nothingness above. "How much further do you think it goes on?" He asked, his voice carried over vast, unfathomable distances to his companions.

The second figure shrugged. "This universe seems endless. We've traveled for so long, and never found an end or beginning. I don't know if it even has an edge." She tossed another piece of debris onto the fire, watching as it crumbled into ash and stardust. 

"There has to be something out there." Said the third figure. He was hunched over, his indistinct form radiating exhaustion through every part of his insubstantial being. "I can't bear the thought that we escaped one dying universe just to end up trapped in another infinite void."

The first figure stood up, peering into the distance as if hoping to catch a glimpse of something, anything to break up the monotony. But there were no stars, no planets, no celestial bodies of any kind - just the campfire and the figures gathered around it, floating untethered in a lightless sea. 

"We have to keep going." He said, turning back to the fire. The others nodded in agreement. To stop was to accept this as their reality, forever cut off from everything they had once known. And so they would continue their endless journey, vagabonds drifting between dimensions in search of a universe that might call them its own.

The figures gathered themselves, stamping out the last embers of the fire and plunging once more into the void. The darkness swallowed them whole as they ventured forth again, ever onward to some uncertain future, some yet unknowable end. The campfire cooled and faded behind them, a tiny point of light and warmth now lost forever on the edge of the known universe.
