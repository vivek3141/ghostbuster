The old wooden clock in the town square chimed midday as Emma left the bakery, a warm loaf of bread in her basket. The sun shone bright, doing little to take the chill from the autumn air. Emma pulled her shawl tighter around her shoulders and headed down the cobblestone street toward home. 

As she walked, she thought of her husband Thomas away at sea, his merchant ship voyaging to the West Indies to trade goods. He had been gone nearly three months now. Emma worried for his safety, knowing the peril that awaited ships at sea. But she tried to comfort herself that he was an experienced captain, and his crew able men. With any luck, the Jane Elizabeth would return within a few weeks, its hull laden with spices and cloth and other exotic wares. 

Emma was so lost in her thoughts, she nearly walked past the open door of the printer's shop. But a flash of color caught her eye—a bright red broadsheet newly posted. Curious, she moved closer to get a better look. It was an official notice declaring the start of war with Spain. Her heart dropped like a stone.

Now Thomas and his crew were in far greater danger. The waters of the Atlantic would be prowled by Spanish privateers and pirates. Any English ship was a potential target, its cargo and gold ripe for the taking. Emma stood frozen in place, her panicked imagination conjuring images of the Jane Elizabeth besieged, her beloved husband captured or worse.  

For a long moment, all Emma could do was stare at those bold red letters, as if by doing so she might will them to change or disappear. But at last she shook herself, knowing she must go home. There was work to be done, chores that would not cease just because of her worry and fear. But her steps felt heavy as lead as she walked on.

Over the following days, Emma struggled in a fog of dread and uncertainty. Neighbors sought to console her, but their kind words did little to pierce the gloom that had settled upon her. Her usual tasks seemed vain and pointless. Food held no appeal. Sleep eluded her, her thoughts restless and uneasy. She prayed ceaselessly for Thomas’s safe return.

And then one morning, as grey dawn light filtered through the windows, Emma awoke to the familiar creak of footsteps climbing the stairs. Her breath caught in her throat. It couldn't be. She lay motionless, listening. The door opened with a groan, and a gentle voice spoke—"Emma, my love, I've come back to you.”

Emma bolted up in bed, her heart swelling with a joy she thought never to feel again. There in the doorway stood Thomas, weary but unharmed. He had come back to her at last.
