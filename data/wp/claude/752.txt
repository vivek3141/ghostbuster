The old warehouse loomed over the pier, empty and abandoned for decades. Bill often came here when his illness felt too much to bear.  The solitude and sea air calmed his anxious mind. 

As Bill sat on the edge of the pier, a young woman walked by. He nodded a greeting and she nodded back. To his surprise, she sat down a few feet away, gazing at the setting sun.

They sat in silence for a while. The water lapped gently under their feet.

Finally the woman spoke. “It’s peaceful here.”

“Yes,” said Bill. “I come here when I want to escape my troubles.”

“I know the feeling,” she said. “My name is Eva.”

“Bill.” 

They shook hands. Eva’s grip felt limp and cold.

“Do you want to talk about it?” asked Bill.

Eva shrugged. “Talking does no good. The pain doesn’t go away.”

“Believe me, I know pain,” said Bill. “I have cancer. The doctors say I only have a few months left.”

Eva looked at him with tears in her eyes. “I’m so sorry.”   

“It’s okay,” said Bill. “I’ve come to accept it. But what about you? What’s troubling you?”  

Eva hesitated. “I just feel hopeless. Like there’s no point in going on.”  

Bill felt a pang of worry. "Please talk to me. I want to help if I can."

The sky turned dusky orange as Eva opened up about her despair. Bill listened without judgment. By the time the stars emerged, they had forged an unlikely but deep connection.  

“Thank you for listening,” said Eva. “It means more than you know.”

“Likewise,” said Bill. “I feel less afraid now, having shared this moment with you.”

They sat together in a comfortable silence, gazing at the night sky. Eventually, Eva stood up. "I should go. Will you come back here again tomorrow?"

Bill smiled. "I'll be here."

Eva smiled back, eyes shining with tears and starlight. "Then so will I." 

She turned and walked into the night. Bill watched her go, gratitude and peace flowing through him under the sea of stars. For the first time since his diagnosis, death did not seem so dark. In that brief and destined meeting, they had given each other a gift more precious than life itself—hope reborn and a reason to see another day.
