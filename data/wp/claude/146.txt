I opened my eyes and was immediately confused. Everything around me was red and orange, flickering shadows dancing across the landscape. An acrid smell filled the air—burning, sulfur. 

Where was I? This didn’t look like any place I had been before. I tried to think back to how I got here, but my memories were hazy. I vaguely recalled going to sleep as usual in my bed, but now I was...somewhere else.

As I slowly sat up, I realized with dawning horror that I recognized this place. I had seen it in books, heard preachers shout warnings about it from their pulpits. But it couldn’t be real, could it?

Hell. I was in Hell. 

Panic rose in my chest as the truth sank in. An endless sea of fire and brimstone, the air shimmering with heat, the sounds of distant anguished screams echoing all around. I stumbled to my feet, desperately looking for an escape, but there was nothing in every direction. No doors, no paths, just an infinite abyss of flame.

Fear threatening to overwhelm me, I spun around—and froze. There, standing before me, was a figure I immediately knew. Tall, sinister, with crimson skin and enormous black horns, mismatched legs, and a barbed tail swaying behind him. The Devil gazed at me with ancient, evil eyes and smiled, revealing pointed teeth.

My heart stopped. I opened my mouth but couldn’t find the words. What could you possibly say to the ruler of Hell itself? 

The Devil watched me, seeming amused at my terror and confusion. “Finally,” he spoke, his voice like gravel. “You’re the first to arrive. Now then, who are you? What foul deeds have you done to earn you a place in my kingdom, and how did you meet your end, mortal?”

I stammered, my mind racing. What had I done to deserve damnation? I had lived a normal life, without great sin or evil. "I—I don't belong here," I said. "There must be some mistake."

The Devil threw back his head and laughed. "There are no mistakes here, fool. All who come to Hell are meant to be here, to suffer for eternity." His eyes narrowed. "You cannot escape your fate. Now answer—who did you kill? Who did you betray? What sins have you committed that your God saw fit to banish you to this place?" 

My hands shook. "None! I didn't do anything to deserve Hell. I lived a good life. I don't know how I died, I just went to sleep and woke up here! There's been some kind of error." 

The Devil snorted in contempt. "Lies. No mortal escapes sin, and no soul comes to Hell unjustly." He leaned close, eyes glowing with malevolence. "Search your heart. You know the truth, wretched creature. Now speak, and I may be inclined to mercy and make your torment slightly less unbearable."

I swallowed hard, wracking my brain. This had to be a nightmare. I would wake up any moment in my own bed, not trapped in this awful place. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't find a shred of evil that would justify being damned for eternity.

"I have nothing to confess," I said, meeting the Devil's glare without flinching. "I do not belong in Hell, and I certainly will not let you torment me for sins I did not commit!"  

The Devil's smile faded. He straightened to his full, towering height, eyes now blazing with rage and offense. "You dare defy me? I am the master of this domain, and all who dwell here are mine to torment as I please! Your pitiful mortal soul cannot escape my grasp now." 

He lunged forward, grabbing my arm in an iron grip, claws piercing my flesh. I cried out in pain as he hauled me close, his hot breath scalding my face, teeth bared in fury. "Foolish, arrogant speck! You will learn respect and obedience, even if I must tear the flesh from your bones for a thousand years to teach you!"

His hand began to glow, unholy fire kindling beneath my skin. The agony was worse than anything I could have imagined, searing into my very soul. I thrashed in his grip, screaming, begging for release, but there was no escape from his wrath. 

The fires of Hell raged around me as the Devil's laughter echoed in my ears, my own screams joining the endless chorus of the damned. I had no hope of salvation or reprieve—I could only suffer for a sin I did not commit, and wish desperately that this were all still just a nightmare from which I might wake. But there would be no waking. I was trapped in Perdition, and the price for my defiance would be an eternity of anguish and flame.
