The Numbers 

My whole life, numbers floated above everyone's heads, counting the population. My number read 7,753,000,000. I never questioned it.

One morning, I looked in the mirror and froze. My number read 00000000007,753,000,000. Backwards.

I panicked. Was I going crazy? I checked again. Backwards.  I looked at my roommate. His number was normal. 

At work, backwards. I rushed to a doctor. "My number, it's backwards!" The doctor looked at me puzzled. His number was normal.

"I don't see anything wrong." he said. 

I insisted he check again. He saw nothing. Was I hallucinating?

Driving home, I checked each person I passed. All normal numbers. Except mine in reflections.

At home, I called my mother. "Mom, can you see my number? Is it backwards?"

Silence. Then, "Your gift. It's activated."

"What gift?" 

She sighed. "Our family has a gift. We see beyond the numbers, to the truth. Your real number has been revealed. You're seeing what's really there."

I gazed in the mirror again. Backwards. The truth. My eyes had opened to the secret codes within the numbers. I smiled, understanding dawning as my gift awakened. The numbers spoke to me and I could finally hear them. My real number was revealed.
