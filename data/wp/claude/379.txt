I woke up feeling perfectly fine. No sniffles, no cough, no ache in my bones. Just the usual morning grogginess that faded after my first cup of coffee. 

It wasn't until I went outside that I realized something was very wrong. The streets were empty. No cars driving by, no people walking their dogs or jogging. An eerie silence blanketed the neighborhood.

I knocked on my neighbor's door. No answer. I tried a few more houses. Nothing. My heartbeat quickened as a thought crossed my mind: could there be some sort of containment order in place? Had some virus escaped from a lab overnight?

I turned on the news to a bizarre sight: an empty newsroom. The usual news anchors and reporters were missing. A prerecorded message repeated on a loop: "We are experiencing technical difficulties. Regular news programming will resume shortly."

Panic started to set in as I flipped through channel after channel of the same message and empty sets. I tried calling a few friends and family members but nobody picked up. It seemed I was alone.

A terrifying thought occurred to me: what if I was the only person left? What if some apocalyptic event had wiped out everyone on the planet except me while I was sleeping? 

I raced over to the local hospital, bursting through the front entrance. "Hello?" I called out. My voice echoed through the empty hallways. The place was completely abandoned, doors hanging open, papers scattered on the floor. Not one doctor, nurse or patient in sight.

A cold chill ran through me as I sped home. I turned on my laptop, searching for clues. News websites hadn't been updated since yesterday. Almost all social networks were eerily silent, empty of the usual stream of photos, updates and shares. But there were a smattering of posts with a common refrain: "Sick. So sick. Everyone sick."

One post in particular caught my eye: "Earth 2 reporting. Entire population ill. Only difference from your Earth is that I did not die on your plane."

It was then that the truth dawned on me. I was never supposed to wake up this morning in this universe. On every other parallel version of Earth, my doppelganger had perished overnight from some mass illness. But in this lonely branch of reality, I survived. I should have gotten sick like everyone else. But I didn't. And now here I was, utterly alone. The last person on Earth. My inability to die had doomed this entire universe. I shuddered at the thought of the endless solitary days that now loomed before me. This was going to be Hell. I closed my eyes and wished with all my might to awake in a universe filled with life once more.
