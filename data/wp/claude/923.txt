The Rushing Wind 

You swoop down from the mountaintops, blowing through the valleys below. You are the wind, powerful and swift. You travel where you wish, dancing between the trees and rolling over the hills.

As you gust through a meadow, the long grasses bow before you. Seeds clutched tight in their pods are torn away and scattered afar, carried off to lands unknown on your drifting breeze. The bees and butterflies flit away from your invisible speed, seeking shelter amid the folds of the meadow until you pass by.

In the forest, the ancient trees groan under your rushing push. They bend and sway but they do not break, anchored deep into the earth. You throw sticks and leaves high up into the air just to watch them twist and turn. A lone owl lifts off in annoyance as you disturb the branches of its quiet perch. You laugh in whispers and continue your race through the dark wood.  

You sweep into a village, tugging at closed doors and rattling windowpanes. Smoke from chimneys disperses in your swirling wake. A farmer chases his hat as it rolls along before your playful gales. You spread your fingers and reach out to tousle every rope and shutter and weather vane, announcing your fleeting presence to the inhabitants below. 

And then you glide away, your energy boundless as you resume your pace up into the highest peaks. There the raptors know your invisible embrace, riding upon your currents with feathers outstretched in joy. You are the wind, and you travel as you will forevermore across the land.
