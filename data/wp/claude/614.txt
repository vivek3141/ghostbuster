The sun filtered through the trees as I walked down the forest path. It was a beautiful day like any other. I hummed a tune, enjoying the warm breeze on my skin. 

Suddenly, I stopped in my tracks. A strange feeling came over me. I looked down at my body and realized with a start - I was naked. Completely bare.

How had I never noticed this before? For my whole life, neither I nor anyone I knew had ever worn a stitch of clothing. Nudity was utterly normal. And yet, in this moment, I was overcome with a foreign sense of embarrassment and shame. My nudity felt oddly exposed and vulnerable.

I darted behind a tree, my heart racing. Peeking around the trunk, the path seemed ominous and threatening. What if someone should see me? But why did it matter? Just minutes ago, I had not a care in the world about who might glimpse my natural state.

A rustle in the bushes startled me. I whipped around to see a friend approaching down the path. "Hello!" she called. But now her nudity seemed inappropriate and uncomfortable. I felt the urge to shield my eyes.

She greeted me with a quizzical look. "Are you alright?"

I stammered, struggling for words to explain sensations that made no sense. "I - I suddenly feel so naked."

She frowned, confused. "But we are always naked. We have nothing to feel shy about. Our bodies are natural."

I knew this was true. And yet, I couldn't shake the feeling of wanting to cover up. The realization dawned on me: for the first time, I had become aware of the societal conventions of clothing and modesty that I had never been exposed to. The forbidden knowledge could not be unlearned. 

My friend smiled patiently and took my hand. "Come, let's walk together." As we strolled down the sun-dappled path, the feeling gradually faded. My nudity once again felt normal and right. But still, in the back of my mind lingered the idea that nudity could be strange and discomforting. I knew now there were other ways of thinking, even if I had never glimpsed them before. The world seemed somehow wider, and yet more complicated. I had eaten of the fruit of knowledge that could not be undone.
