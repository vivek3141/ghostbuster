The Demon Within 

I had always known I was different. While the other children talked excitedly about what animal would emerge as their second soul, I stayed silent. Animals were natural partners for humans, helping provide strength, courage, and companionship. But animals wanted normal lives with families, jobs, and community. There was no place in that life for me.

The first time my demon emerged, I was 10. The school bully had cornered me behind the abandoned gym with his usual sneer. But this time, he had a knife. As he swung it menacingly towards me, an unearthly roar burst from my lips. The bully stumbled back in terror as dark shadows wrapped around me like a cloak. "You will leave now," my voice thundered, "or face my wrath." The bully ran as if chased by the hounds of hell themselves. 

I tried to pretend it never happened, clinging to the hope that a normal second soul might still emerge. But in the lonely nights, I heard the demon whisper in my mind. It spoke of power and vengeance, hinting at the destruction it could wreak upon my enemies if I only gave it freedom. Its sibilant promises both thrilled and repulsed me. I knew once I unleashed that power, there would be no going back. The demon would own me entirely.

The day my best friend died, my resolve broke. We were exploring an old abandoned factory when a rotted railing gave way. I was left clinging to a ledge, my friend's screams as he plunged echoing through the chamber. Rage and grief merged into an unstoppable torrent, and I screamed for the demon. 

It rose from the depths of my soul like a leviathan from the sea. The shadows in the room coalesced into a physical form as it strode over and grasped my hand. With casual indifference, it hauled me up and turned to where my friend had fallen. A sly smile crossed its face and it nonchalantly waved a hand. A dark cloud materialized below, depositing my friend's broken body atop it. 

The demon knelt and placed its hands on my friend's chest. His breaths came shuddering back as bones snapped into place and wounds sealed shut. Lidless eyes flared open, no longer my friend's warm brown but a glowing, sinister red. 

The demon rose and faced me, a mocking bow echoing with menace. "Your wish is granted. Your 'friend' will live - but by my power and under my control. His soul is forfeit. And you, dear child, now belong to me."

A malevolent laugh echoed through the chamber as the demon's shadows wrapped me in their cold embrace. I had unleashed a power I could never escape, damning my friend and dooming myself. The demon within had at last emerged, and my soul shuddered in helpless terror of the summoning.
