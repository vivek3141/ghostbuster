The old king chuckled as he read the prophecy, scribbled onto a crumbling scroll by the court seer. Your seventh son will murder you. Preposterous. He and the queen only had three daughters. He crumpled up the scroll and tossed it into the fireplace, watching the flames devour the ominous warning. 

A few days later, the king was out riding through the forest when a figure emerged from the bushes. It was a young boy, no more than 12, with auburn hair and eyes the same shade as the king's. 

"Are you the king?" the boy asked hesitantly.

The king nodded. "I am. And who might you be, my boy?"

The child straightened up. "My name is Merek. My mother says you're my father."

The king froze in his saddle. His mind raced back through memories of his younger days, before his arranged marriage to the queen. There had been a farm girl, red hair and a mischievous smile. He had been 17 and foolish. The king stroked his beard, studying the boy. There was a resemblance he couldn't deny.

He sighed, his breath fogging in the cool morning air. "It seems your mother told you the truth. You are my son."

The boy's eyes lit up. "Then I'm a prince!"

The king shook his head. "You are simply Merek." He tossed the boy a bulging sack of gold coins. "This should help you and your mother live comfortably."

With that, he spurred his horse onward, leaving the boy behind. The king's heart pounded as he rode hard for the castle. A seventh son. The prophecy echoed in his mind, its warning mocking him now. He burst into the vault and searched through old records until he found what he was looking for: records from the royal sperm bank. Decades ago, his advisors had convinced him to donate to help infertile families. There had been seven donations in total before he married the queen.

The king sank to the floor as the truth crashed over him in waves of panic. Seven sons. He knew now the seer's prophecy wasn't ridiculous after all. His sins were catching up to him, and one of those sons would be his doom.

But which one? And when would the fateful day come? The king rode out again in secret, tracking down the other six boys, now men. He watched them from a distance, eyes peering from under a hooded cloak.

A farmhand. A blacksmith. A wandering bard. A scholar. A soldier. A peasant woodcutter.  

Which one harbored rage or ambition enough to kill the king who sired him? Which one even knew of the king's role in his birth? The king agonized over the mystery each day as his doom lingered, unseen, waiting to strike.

In the end, the blow came out of the blue on a calm spring morning. The king was strolling through the garden when he noticed a weedâ€”an unusual purple flower he didn't recognize. He wondered if it might be of some use, so he bent down to dig it up and study its root. 

The arrow pierced his back with a thud. As the king collapsed onto the soft earth of the garden, his eyes found a hooded figure with a bow, racing away through the trees. But in that last moment, the king's gaze fixed on the weed still clutched in his trembling fingers.

The purple flower of death, he realized. His end had found him at last. And so the seer's prophecy was fulfilled.
