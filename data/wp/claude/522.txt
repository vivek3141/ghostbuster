The old clock tower loomed over the small town, its giant clock face a silent sentinel keeping watch. Jill walked down the cobblestone street towards the tower, as she did every Saturday morning. The familiar ritual comforted her.

As Jill walked up the stone steps of the tower, she noticed something peculiar. The massive front door, usually closed, stood slightly ajar. She paused, feeling uneasy. In all her years coming to the tower, she had never found the door open. 

Cautiously, Jill pushed open the heavy door. It creaked loudly, the sound echoing up the tower. As her eyes adjusted to the dim light inside, she gasped. The giant clock mechanism in the center of the room was completely still. The enormous gears, normally turning and churning loudly, were frozen in place.

Jill's heart raced. She hurried up the spiral stairs to the top of the tower, where the massive bell hung. Peering out the open arches, she saw the familiar shops and rooftops of the little town below. But something felt off. The streets seemed too empty, the chimneys across town cold and bare. A realization struck Jill with dawning horror. Time had stopped in the little town. The clock, the beating heart of her beloved community, had gone silent. 

Familiar cobblestone  creaked open ajar heart dawning atop too horror had gone.
