The twin suns rose over the forest canopy, filtering through the emerald leaves and dappling the forest floor. Dain opened his eyes as the first rays of warmth hit his face. He stretched out on the mossy hammock and took a deep breath of the crisp air.

His village began to stir as the suns climbed higher into the sky and more beams found their way to the forest floor. The treehouses were interconnected by rope bridges, and Dain could see his fellow villagers going about their morning—preparing food, exercising, meditating. 

Dain climbed down from his hammock and set off along a winding dirt path through the forest. Massive trees towered on either side of the path, trunks wider than his whole house. His bare feet crunched over leaves and branches as he walked. 

In a nearby clearing, Dain found the rest of the hunting party preparing their gear. They would venture deeper into the forest in search of their prey. The hunters lived in harmony with the natural world around them, only taking what was necessary and replenishing resources for the future.

Equilibrium. That was the guiding principle of their society. Take only what you need, do only what is sustainable and renewable. Live in balance with nature. As a result, there was no shortage of food, no lack of shelter or resources. The 40 tribes lived spread throughout the forests in small communities, mostly self-sustaining but coming together to trade goods and share knowledge. 

After a successful hunt and meal, Dain lay back in his hammock as the suns dipped below the horizon, basking in their warmth and the sounds of the forest. This was the world as it should be— humanity existing as part of the natural system rather than trying to dominate it. An equilibrium that had lasted for generations and would endure for thousands more years to come. Peace and balance reigned supreme.
