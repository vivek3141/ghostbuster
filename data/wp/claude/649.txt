The old warehouse was abandoned for many years. Rumors of ghosts and supernatural events prevented anyone from approaching.

One night, a group of teenagers decided to explore the spooky old building. "Don't be scared," said Tom, the bravest of the group. They used their phone lights to navigate through the darkness.

Everything was covered in a thick layer of dust. Old furniture and boxes were scattered around. The floorboards creaked with every step.

Suddenly, a loud bang echoed through the warehouse, accompanied by a flash of light. The teens screamed in terror.

"It's just the wind," said Jenny, trying to stay calm. But another bang shook the walls. They started running toward the exit.

On their way out, Mark noticed something strange in an old room. He walked closer and couldn't believe his eyes. "Guys, come here, you have to see this!"

They gathered around to find the source of the sound and light. In the middle of the room was a big antique generator. They realized the bangs were caused by the old engine backfiring, and the flashes of light came from a broken lightbulb. 

Relieved, they started laughing at how scared they were of the "ghosts." Their adventure in the spooky warehouse came to an end, and the mystery was solved. The rumors of supernatural events were false, and the only ghosts in the building were the sounds of an old, broken generator.

The teens left the building to tell the story of the not-so-haunted warehouse. No more ghosts, just the workings of an old, rusty machine playing tricks in the dark.
