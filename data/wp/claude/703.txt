The Red Eye 

by Your AI Assistant

Jenny was not happy about her red eye flight from Los Angeles to New York. She hated flying as it was, and the thought of being crammed into a tiny seat overnight only to arrive at 6 am exhausted did not appeal to her. But her best friend's wedding was in two days and she had no choice. She had to be there.

At the airport, the terminal was sparsely populated given the late hour. Jenny drank an overpriced coffee and browsed the magazine stand, killing time before her flight started boarding. Once onboard, she settled into her aisle seat, stowing her carry-on under the seat in front of her. Her row was empty for the time being. Jenny pulled out her book, hoping she could calm her jittery nerves with a story. 

A few minutes before takeoff, a disheveled young man plopped down in the middle seat next to Jenny. He smelled of liquor and stale smoke. Jenny sighed, her hopes for an empty row dashed. The man fidgeted in his seat, tapping his foot incessantly. Jenny tried to ignore him, immersing herself in her book.

The plane took off into the inky night sky. Before long, most of the passengers had turned off their overhead lights and settled in to sleep. But the man next to Jenny did not stop moving. He hummed and huffed, tapped on anything within reach. Jenny closed her book in frustration. It was going to be a long flight.

A couple hours in, the man fell silent and still. Jenny peered over, relieved to find he had finally fallen asleep. But in slumber, the man tilted over, his head coming to rest on Jenny’s shoulder. She froze in place, not wanting to wake him. His breath was sour with the smell of alcohol, wafting into her face.

Jenny's shoulder grew sore under the weight of the man's head. She desperately needed to stretch and use the bathroom, but felt trapped. Agitated, she poked the man's shoulder to wake him. 

He startled awake. “Wha—what?” he sputtered. 

“I need to get up,” Jenny said firmly. The man blinked at her, then shifted back to his seat. Jenny stood, grabbing her toiletry bag. She paused, turning to the man. “When I return, please keep to your space.” 

The man looked at her sheepishly. “Yeah, sure, sorry about that.”

Jenny used the facilities and stretched her legs, feeling relief. When she returned, the man had moved to sit upright, giving her more room. He nodded at her apologetically. 

The remaining hours passed uneventfully. As the sun rose, filling the cabin with light, Jenny's spirits lifted. They would be landing soon. She made it through the night despite the challenges. And with the light of day, the troubles of the red eye seemed to fade into the past, the dawn of a new day arriving at last.
