The Signal 

After 60 years of silence, the message came. 

Jenna could hardly believe her eyes as the words scrolled across the monitor:

The birds are not what they seem

Her heart raced. This was first contact. In 7 cryptic words, everything had changed.

She sounded the alarm and within minutes, the control room filled with NASA's top brass. They stared in disbelief at the message. 

The birds are not what they seem. What could it mean? Birds monitored? Surveillance drones in disguise? A warning? 

The global media picked up the news. The world now shared in the anticipation and speculation. Government leaders demanded answers, but there were none to give. 

Jenna and her team analyzed every possible clue. They re-examined 60 years of bird migration data, satellite footage, weather patterns looking for anything out of the ordinary. Nothing.

Three agonizing days later, it came again:

Apologies. Wrong transmission. Please disregard previous message.  

Then only silence.

No further explanation came. The mystery endured. The truth remained elusive, and the few words lingered:

The birds are not what they seem.
