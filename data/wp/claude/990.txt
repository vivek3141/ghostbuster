I couldn't believe I was actually at the Olympics. Me, average Joe from down the street, competing on the world stage. When the Olympic committee announced they were selecting random individuals to compete in each event to "provide contrast and context for the incredible skill of the athletes," I assumed it was a joke. Until the letter showed up instructing me to report for the shot put competition. 

Now here I was, surrounded by hulking athletes with arms bigger than my head, practicing their throws with what looked like cannon balls. And me with my 10 pound allotted practice shot that I could barely lift. I had never even watched shot put before, let alone competed. The athletes eyed me and chuckled, clearly not worried I would provide them any meaningful contrast.

When my turn came to throw in the preliminaries, I lumbered up to the line, struggling to hold the 16 pound competition shot put. I awkwardly spun and pushed the weight up and away from me as hard as I could. When I released, I nearly fell over from the effort. There were more chuckles from the athletes and snickers from the crowd. Until the scoreboard lit up - 21.3 meters. Shocked silence, then a smattering of confused applause. An Olympic record for amateurs. The athletes were no longer chuckling.

In the finals, I listened as the announcers touted my freak amateur shot as a "fluke" and "comedic relief." When I stepped up for my first throw, my eyes met those of the favorite, massive Aleksandr Borisov. His eyes narrowed. He was not expecting or wanting a challenge from me. My heart pounding, I threw - 22.1 meters. A new Olympic amateur record. The crowd gasped. Borisov grunted with effort and landed his first throw at 21.8 meters. Close, but not past me. His angry glare told me I would pay for this embarrassment.

On my next throw, Borisov marched up as I prepared, leaning in to "drop" his practice shot just as I released, the loud bang and distraction causing me to stumble and toss it weakly. His attempt to disrupt me resulted in a foul, but my throw was still an easy record at 23.4 meters. Borisov turned purple with rage as the crowd booed his underhanded tactic. When he threw next, he was so amped up his landing was a good meter behind me. The other athletes were now eyeing me and Borisov, the drama unfolding.

Final throw. Borisov again stomped over as I prepared, this time shoving me hard before walking to his lane. The crowd erupted in anger but no foul was called. Shaken, I stepped up for my throw on wobbly legs. As Borisov threw and hit a new record of 23 meters, grinning maliciously at me, I closed my eyes and summoned everything I had. I spun and launched that metal ball with all my despair, frustration and anger.

When I opened my eyes, the scoreboard lit up - 24.2 meters. A new Olympic record. The crowd exploded. I had done it. Borisov's record throw now meant silver. His massive body slumped as he realized an average Joe had beaten him, his bullying and cheating gaining him nothing in the end.  I barely heard the announcers over the wild cheers of the crowd, declaring me the "unlikeliest Olympic champion in history." David had conquered Goliath. And this average Joe would forever be an Olympic gold medalist.
