The Automatic Door Dilemma  

Being a vampire isn't all it's cracked up to be. Sure, there are some perks like immortality, super strength and the ability to shapeshift into a bat. But there are also a lot of downsides no one tells you about until after you've been turned. 

The biggest downside? Automatic doors, soap dispensers and paper towel dispensers don't detect you. At all. I know it sounds trivial, but when you have to open every door by hand, get soap and dry your hands manually, it gets annoying fast.

Take tonight for example. I was out for a quick feeding at the local hospital. After enjoying a tasty snack of O-negative, I headed to the restroom to clean up. But the door didn't budge as I walked up to it. I waved my hands frantically, jumped up and down, but nothing. An elderly man in a hospital gown came up behind me. The door sprang open. He held it for me with a confused look. 

"Thanks," I muttered, my pale cheeks reddening. At least vampires can't see their reflection, so I didn't have to see how foolish I looked.

Once inside, the soap dispenser stubbornly refused to work. The paper towel dispenser was equally uncooperative. I ended up drying my bloody hands on my shirt, leaving suspicious stains I hoped no one would notice. 

On my way out, I braced myself for another round of door gymnastics. But a doctor was heading in, so I clutched her coat sleeve and followed her through to the other side. She gave me a strange sideways glance and I dropped her sleeve like it was on fire.

"Malfunctioning doors," I said with an embarrassed smile.  Her confusion faded and she gave a knowing nod. At least vampires are adept at minor hypnosis and suggestion.

By the time I got back to my apartment, dawn was breaking. As I settled into my coffin, exhausted and frustrated from a night of futile waves and jumps, I found myself wishing for the early days again. The days when a vampire just needed a finger to tap the correct spot on a wooden door to gain entrance. The days before every imaginable item became automated. I shut the lid on my coffin wondering if the vampire community could lobby to mandate manual doors and paper towels. We may be the eternally undead, but we're also eternally inconveniented. And that, as it turns out, really sucks.
