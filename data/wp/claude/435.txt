The Atlantis Envoy 

The familiar Manhattan skyline came into view as the sleek Atlantean craft glided noiselessly over the churning gray waters of the Atlantic.  Larta gripped the amulet around her neck and took a deep breath to steady her nerves. As the designated envoy of Atlantis, it was her duty to make first contact with the surface world and deliver a message of grave importance.

For millennia, the advanced Atlantean civilization had remained hidden deep beneath the ocean, avoiding contact with the primitive human societies that rose and fell on the surface world above. But now Atlantis faced a crisis that threatened their very existence under the sea. The Council of Elders had reluctantly decided that it was time to reveal themselves to the humans, in the hope that their two civilizations might work together to overcome the challenges that lay ahead.

As the craft landed on the lawn of the United Nations headquarters, a crowd of stunned onlookers gathered, filming with their phones and sharing stunned reactions on their social networks.  A door opened with a soft hiss, and Larta emerged in her sleek bodysuit and amulet, the symbol of an Atlantis envoy. She strode purposefully toward the entrance of the UN building, flanked by two stern-faced Atlantean guards. 

After passing through multiple security checkpoints, Larta was finally escorted into the vast General Assembly hall. Representatives from virtually every nation on Earth were present, abuzz with shock and speculation about the alien visitor in their midst.

Larta stepped up to the podium and raised her hands in greeting. Her words were translated into dozens of languages for delegates to hear.

"People of the surface world, I come from Atlantis, an advanced civilization that has long made its home deep within your planet's oceans. I bear a message for humanity's leaders that could impact the future of both our civilizations."

A stunned silence fell over the hall. Atlantis—the fabled lost continent—was real. And its people were here to warn them about something dire.

Larta continued, "For millennia we have monitored humanity's progress from afar. Though your societies remain deeply flawed, you have made remarkable achievements, from which we believe our two civilizations could learn much. But now catastrophe looms that threatens this planet we share. The climate shift you have begun has weakened a massive undersea shelf that stabilizes one of your continents. Should it collapse, the consequences would be felt around the globe."

The Atlanteans had chosen at last to reveal themselves to humanity. And they had come with a warning that could unite two worlds—and decide the fate of the Earth itself. The future was uncertain, but one thing was clear: this was a turning point in human history that would change everything. The Atlantis Envoy had delivered her message. Now the hard part began.
