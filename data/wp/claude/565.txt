The ERROR Clock 

by your Assistant

My clock has said "ERROR" for as long as I can remember. When every other newborn was implanted with a lifespan clock counting down to their last second, I was the only one whose clock malfunctioned. Doctors couldn't explain it. My parents were initially distressed but learned to ignore it. I tried not to think much about it as I grew up.

Most people checked their clocks obsessively, some with dread others with anticipation.  My friends teased me about my ERROR clock, speculating I might live forever. I laughed along but secretly felt anxious not knowing my fate. At 16, I got into a bad hovercar accident and was rushed into the emergency room, my heart stopped for 3 minutes. When I woke, my clock still said ERROR. The doctors were stunned. My friends started treating me differently after that, either revering me as immortal or avoiding me out of discomfort.

I tried to lead as normal a life as possible. I went to college, got a job, found love. But as Liz's clock counted down to our wedding day, she grew increasingly obsessed with my ERROR clock and what that might mean for our future together. The doubts and unknowns strained our relationship until it broke apart a year later.  

Most of my life continued this way, short relationships and connections hindered by my clock's perpetual error message looming like a question mark over every plan or hope for the future. Friends and family passed away as their clocks reached 0, while mine remained unchanged.

By 85, I had outlived everyone from my generation. I lived alone, increasingly isolated. On my 100th birthday, my clock finally switched to numbers: 100 years, 0 days, 0 hours, 0 minutes. Stunned, I watched the seconds start ticking down. A message flashed: "Thank you for your patience. Live fully now, the end is always near."

Tears streamed down my face as I realized I had been given the gift of life with no timer, a vastly different fate than any other. My ERROR clock allowed me to live fully present each day as a mysterious gift, rather than chasing or dreading some predetermined future moment. I stepped outside and breathed the fresh air, grateful for this eternal moment of now. My clock may now be counting down, but I will live more deeply than ever before. The end is always near, but life's beauty is eternal.
