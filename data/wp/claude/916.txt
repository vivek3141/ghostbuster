The old worn envelope sat on the table, my name and address scrawled on the front in familiar handwriting. With a trembling hand, I opened it, my breath caught in my throat. Inside were just two words:

He survived. 

I sank into the chair as tears of joy and relief flooded my eyes. My son, my little boy, was alive. For three years I had lived with the ache of his loss, the pain of not knowing his fate. When the war broke out, he proudly enlisted to serve, only 18 and full of youthful exuberance and the invincibility of the young. The letters from the front lines came regularly at first, then slowed, then stopped coming at all. The military could not provide any information about his fate or whereabouts. I was left adrift, clinging to the slim hope that no news was good news, yet fearing the worst as the casualty lists grew longer each day.

And now this, two simple words that changed everything. He survived. My son was alive. I said a silent prayer of thanks as new questions flooded in. Where was he? Was he injured? When could I see him? I longed to hold him in my arms, to see his smile and hear his laughter once more. I knew the road ahead was long, that he would need time to heal from whatever wounds he had endured, physical and emotional. But he was coming home. My son was coming home.

I clutched the note to my chest, tears splashing on the paper and causing the ink to run, blurring yet not obscuring those two beautiful words: He survived. I knew not what tomorrow would bring, there would be challenges to overcome, but for now I allowed relief and joy to wash over me as I repeated them over and over â€“ he survived, he survived, he survived. My son was alive and coming home. The ache in my heart eased for the first time in three long years. He survived. That was all that mattered. My boy was coming home at last.
