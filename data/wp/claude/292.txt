You shift uncomfortably in the hard wooden pew, wishing for the umpteenth time that you had skipped church today. The sermon seems to be dragging on even longer than usual. You stifle a yawn and look around at the congregation. The usual crowd, mostly older folks and a smattering of young families. 

Finally, the sermon ends and the priest announces it's time for communion. You get in line behind the others, not expecting anything out of the ordinary. A few minutes later, the blood of Jesus, in the form of red wine, is offered to you. You take a sip from the chalice and notice an oddly bitter, metallic aftertaste. Must be a new brand of wine.

Within minutes, colors seem brighter and sounds seem amplified in the large room. An odd tingling sensation starts in your fingers and toes. You shake your head, trying to clear it, but the feeling intensifies. The floral pattern on the dress of the woman in front of you starts to swirl and undulate. Puzzled, you rub your eyes but it only gets more vivid and strange.

A sense of panic starts to rise in your chest as the realization dawns that something is very wrong. This isn't just a trick of the light or your imagination. Your heart begins to race and pound in your ears. You stumble out of the pew, grasping at straws for an explanation. The only thing that comes to mind is that the communion wine must have been laced with some kind of hallucinogenic drug. 

The trip intensifies until the walls start breathing and melting. You hear a roaring sound as blood rushes in your ears. Bile rises in your throat as the room spins violently. You have to get out of here. You lurch down the aisle, grasping at pews and people to keep from falling over. Their faces distort into grotesque masks. You finally crash through the double doors into the blinding sunlight. The cool air helps revive you, but the world remains fractured into a kaleidoscope of shapes and sounds. Your last shred of control finally slips away as you give in to the madness brought on by that fateful sip of Jesusâ€™ blood.
