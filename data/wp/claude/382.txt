The Demon Portal

For the past century, portals to a demon dimension have been opening up over the surface of the world. The largest portal has just opened in the middle of NYC, destroying the city. 

Jenny coughed as she opened her eyes. The seven-year-old was lying in a massive crater where New York City used to be. Skyscrapers had crumbled into dust and ash around her. 

As Jenny stood up, her bones ached. She didn't know how she had survived. In the distance, she saw a shimmering red portal, larger than anything she had seen before. Strange creatures and beasts emerged from it, their shrieks and roars echoing across the ruins.

Jenny knew about the portals. Her parents had told her the stories of the demons that came through, wreaking havoc before vanishing again. But none had been this big. As she watched, the demons tore into the remains of the city, ripping apart the rubble and devouring everything in their path.

Her family was gone. Her whole world was gone. Jenny was alone.

Except for one voice in her head. A woman's voice, comforting and strong. "Do not be afraid, child," the voice said. "You have a great power within you, and a great destiny. Focus your power on the portal. Close it."

Jenny didn't understand. But she closed her eyes and focused, channeling all her fear and loss and anger into the portal. There was an explosion of light. 

When Jenny opened her eyes again, the portal had vanished. The demons froze in place, then evaporated into shadows. 

The city was destroyed, but the world was safe. Jenny sat down in the ruins and cried for her lost family. But she knew this was only the beginning of her destiny as a portal breaker. Her power had awakened, and there were more portals to close, more demons to defeat. She was the only one left to save humanity.
