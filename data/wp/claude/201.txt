The words had been there as long as I could remember, etched into my skin in messy handwriting. 'I never loved you.' A constant reminder that love may not be in the cards for me. 

I had dated a few times, but always held back, fearful of baring my soul to someone only to have it crushed when they spoke those fateful words. It was easier to be alone, to avoid that pain.

Until I met you. Kind, funny, beautiful. For the first time, I felt a stirring in my soul. A hope that maybe you were the one to prove the words wrong. After months of friendship, we finally kissed. And shortly after, nervously and tenderly, we shared our words.

Yours said simply ‘Goodbye, my love.’ Mine, to my surprise, now said ‘I will always love you.' In that moment I knew - you were the one who had been meant for me all along. The one to erase the doubt and fear, and show me a love like I had never known.

We built a life together, filled with joy and passion. Years passed in a blissful haze. Until the day you spoke, weakly, from your hospital bed. "Goodbye, my love." My heart shattered into a million pieces. I crawled into the bed next to you, grasping your feeble body tightly, tears flowing freely. 

Summoning your last ounce of strength, you turned to face me. I steeled myself to hear those words, the ones I had feared my whole life. You smiled softly, lifting a shaking hand to gently stroke my cheek. "I will always love you too."

And with that, you were gone. I clung to you, sobbing, bewildered by your final revelation. The words that had haunted me were lifted, replaced by your eternal promise of love - the most beautiful final gift you could ever give. Our souls had always been meant to find one another, in this life and beyond. And your love was truer than any words could express.
