The icy heart 

The old witch cackled with glee as she clutched the warm, beating heart in her gnarled hands. She had warned the arrogant young prince not to spurn her affections. Now his heart shall be as cold as ice, incapable of love.  

She conjured up an icy heart, pale blue and frozen solid. With one swift motion, she placed it in the prince's chest. His eyes flew open in shock, but his screams were silent. The icy heart did not beat.  

The prince rose, his eyes now pale and cold. He felt nothing. His orders were terse and cruel. The kingdom trembled at his frozen rage.

 A young maiden caught his eye, her beauty stirring something in his icy heart. Fearing it might melt, he banished her from the kingdom. 

The maiden wept, her tears falling onto the icy floor of her carriage as she fled. Her tears burned hot against the ice, melting a small crack in the prince's heart. He felt an unfamiliar pang and faltered. 

The witch cackled in triumph at the prince's anguish. Her vengeance was complete. The prince dared not love, lest his icy heart melt away to nothingness. His heart trapped in ice, the kingdom trapped in winter. All hope melted away.
