The Physics Enforcer 

I have a gift, some may call it a curse. I can see beyond the facade of so-called superpowers and force the real laws of physics to apply. No more flying without propulsion or surviving explosions without a scratch. The flash could run fast but not faster than the speed of sound. Wonder Woman's bracelets could deflect bullets but not tank shells. Physics always wins in the end.

For years I watched as these supposed heroes and villains went about their business, pandering to the masses and abusing their impossible abilities. Someone had to bring truth and realism back to the world. So I donned my costume and went to work, shutting down one ridiculous power at a time.

My first target was easy, a two-bit villain calling himself the Human Inferno who could generate and control flames. A few adjustments and his flames became little more than fancy cigarette lighters, sputtering out in seconds. He threw a tantrum like a toddler once he realized his power was gone. Almost too easy. I left him ranting in an alley, no threat to anyone now. 

Next up, a speedster who called herself Velocity. She loved to dash around the city showing off, creating sonic booms that shattered windows. Not anymore. I reduced her top speed to 60 miles per hour, still fast enough for a ticket but nothing supersonic. Her cries of frustration were music to my ears as I removed another illogical ability from the world.

The heroes started coming after me once they realized what I could do. I was ready for them. Their punches slowed, their laser eyes reduced to cheap laser pointers. Each power I nullified was a victory for science and reason. The people of the city started calling me “The Physics Enforcer” using my abilities to bring order and rationality where there had once been chaos.

Soon crime in the city dropped as villains feared confronting powers that could be easily neutralized. The hero community was in disarray, struggling with the loss of their precious gifts. And the people felt safe under the protection of natural law rather than uncontrollable supposed superheroes. 

My work was nearly complete but there were still a few extreme cases left, beings of supposedly god-like power who stood above the laws of physics as we understood them. It was time to show them the truth: no one is exempt from science in the end. My final campaign was about to begin and a new age of reason would dawn over the city, freed from the shadows of superstition and fantasy masquerading as powers and heroes. Physics always wins.
