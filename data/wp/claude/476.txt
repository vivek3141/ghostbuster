Being married to Lady Gaga was a nonstop whirlwind of activity, creativity, and spectacle. Every day brought a new outfit, a new song idea, a new artistic endeavor. Our home was filled with a changing rotation of wigs, hats, dresses, and shoes in every color of the rainbow. No surface was left unadornedâ€”everything was a canvas for artistic expression.  

Privacy was rare. Paparazzi camped outside our door and followed us whenever we left the house. Being in public with Gaga meant being surrounded by fans seeking autographs, selfies, and a chance to touch their idol. Her life was lived on a grand scale and I was along for the ride.

While the glamour and fame were thrilling, it was also exhausting. Beneath the theatrics, Gaga struggled with being constantly in the public eye. At home, she craved quiet simplicity and normalcy. She would lounge in sweatpants and no makeup, trying to unwind from the stresses of her life. In those private moments, I saw her not as Lady Gaga but as Stefani, a creative soul, much more complex than her public persona suggested. 

Our marriage ultimately crumbled under the pressures of celebrity and constant scrutiny. But we shared a deep bond and indelible experiences during our years together. I witnessed the passion, dedication, fearlessness, and humor that made Lady Gaga a star. Though the whirlwind has passed, its memory lives on. Our love, like her fame, burned bright and burned out fast. Such is life married to a legend. Such is life with Lady Gaga.
