The old tower stood alone on the hill, a crumbling monument to an age long past. Its stones were weathered and covered in moss, but still it stood, sentry over the valley below. 

Generations had passed down the legends of the tower and its guardians. The Sentinels of Time, they were called. Beings not quite human but not spirits either. Ageless, tireless, they kept their silent watch over the tower, protecting its secrets.

Jessa had heard the stories as a child, fanciful tales meant to entertain. She never imagined she would one day climb the winding stairs of the tower itself. Yet here she was, lantern in hand, ascending step by step.

Her mentor, an old scholar of magic and history, had asked her to investigate the tower. Strange energies had been detected emanating from within.  Magical energies. And so Jessa's journey to the tower began.

The stairs seemed to go on endlessly. Just as her legs began to ache, she emerged into a large chamber. A single massive window overlooked the valley, letting in the pale moonlight. 

And there, standing silently by the window, were two figures. 

Jessa stifled a gasp. The Sentinels of Time. Though unmoving, they seemed coiled and ready to strike. Jessa held her breath, unsure of the reception she might receive.

Several heartbeats passed. Then one of the Sentinels turned its head towards her. She braced herself, but no attack came. It simply observed her for a moment, then turned its gaze back out the window.

The gesture, she realized, indicated she was permitted to stay. Jessa let out the breath she had been holding. Her heart still raced, but her curiosity now overtook her fear. She stepped fully into the chamber.

The Sentinels were human in shape, but clearly not human. Their skin seemed ageless and without flaw, pale as marble.  Delicate silver veins ran just beneath the surface.  They were perfectly still, not even seeming to breathe. Yet she could sense an energy and awareness about them.

Jessa hesitantly walked to the window between the two figures. She looked out over the sleeping valley, bathed in moonlight, then glanced up at the starry sky, the celestial cycles continuing their eternal dance. 

She understood, then, their purpose and duty.  The Sentinels were guardians of time itself. This chamber was a place that existed outside of time, a still point from which the turning of ages could be observed. The magical energies her mentor had detected ensured this chamber remained isolated from the flow of history.

A calm and clarity descended upon Jessa. She knew not how long she stood there gazing out the window, sharing in the Sentinelsâ€™ watch. But finally she nodded to herself, her purpose fulfilled. 

As she descended the stairs once more, she glanced back. The Sentinels had not moved from their posts. They would remain as they always had, stoic guardians at the gate of eternity, keeping their silent vigil over the secrets of time. The Sentinels of Time.
