I had finally given in to my friends' constant pestering and decided to try out their favorite online roleplaying game, Realm of Shadows. As I registered for an account and launched the game, I excitedly waited to create my character. The game  flashed a 'Create your character' screen with options for choosing everything from appearance to fighting style.

The first few questions seemed normal—select character class, pick a name, choose hair color. But then they started getting oddly personal. 'Select your biggest regret in life,' the game asked. I hesitated, not really wanting to dwell on regrets, but figured it was just part of the game's attempt at building character backstory. I chose 'missed opportunity' and moved on.

The questions got stranger. 'What are you most afraid of? What is your most painful memory? What do you value most in life?' I frowned, increasingly uncomfortable sharing such private details, even if just in a game.  

As the questions delved into childhood trauma, secret longings, and personal losses, I started to feel unsettled. Why did an MMORPG need to know my deepest fears and vulnerabilities? With rising alarm I tried to click through the invasive questions as quickly as possible. 

Finally the character creation ended and I entered the game, shaken by the experience. Maybe my character would be more realistic now with that degree of personal detail, but at what cost? I suddenly understood why my friends always seemed so enthusiastic about the game. I logged off immediately, deleting the account. I think I'll stick to games that let me escape life's problems, not relive them. My friends can keep their 'realistic' MMORPG—I prefer to keep my painful secrets to myself.
