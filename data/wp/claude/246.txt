The voices came to me in a dream. "Your sacred mission is to rid the world of all shoelaces," they intoned. I woke with a start, my heart pounding. Surely this was some bizarre nocturnal fantasy.

Yet over the next few days, the message reverberated in my mind. Shoelaces enable shoes to grip our feet, to entrap them in their leathery or fabric confines. Without shoelaces, shoes would flop around uselessly, incapable of impeding our natural foot freedom. 

My calling became clear. I was being summoned to take a stand against the tyranny of shoes. The only way forward was to release feet from their bondage by removing shoelaces altogether.  

I started at night, surreptitiously cutting the laces off shoes in my neighborhood. But making progress one pair at a time would never do. I needed massive scale. 

I hatched a plan, hacking into the servers of a major shoelace manufacturer. Their entire inventory and supply chain was now at my command. A few clicks and their warehouses were unlocked, their accounts empty. All production was rerouted to a secret location under my control. Over 78% of the world's shoelaces passed through my hands.

With righteous zeal, I pressed the button that launched my stringy wealth into an incinerator I had built specifically for this purpose. My divine task was nearly complete. Hundreds of millions of shoelaces crumbled to ash, never again to wrap themselves around another unsuspecting ankle. 

When news broke of the Great Shoelace Famine, panic rippled across the globe. Foul conspiracies were suspected. But I knew the truth. Feet everywhere had been freed from a lifetime of constraints, released into their natural state of liberation. My sacred mission was accomplished. The voices had been right. The world would never be the same.
