It all happened so suddenly. One moment I was sitting in my living room, watching TV and eating dinner as usual. The next moment, the whole building started shaking violently. It took me a few seconds to realize it was an earthquake. 

Panic rose in my chest as the shaking intensified. I stumbled to the door frame as plates crashed to the floor in my kitchen. The deafening sound of the building creaking and cracking filled my ears. I prayed the structure would hold.

After what seemed like an eternity, the shaking stopped. An eerie silence followed. I tentatively walked out of the doorway and saw the damageâ€”furniture toppled over, broken glass and ceramics everywhere. The power was out.

In that moment, I felt intense gratitude to be alive and unharmed. My whole world had been shaken in just a few seconds. It was a grim reminder of the fragile nature of life. I resolved not to take anything for granted going forward. While earthquakes may come and go, each moment we have is a gift. I was determined to live life more fully from that day on, finding meaning in simple pleasures and embracing each day as the gift that it is. All because it had happened so suddenly.
