The gods were angry. Their precious humans had abandoned Earth, fleeing to the stars in massive arc ships. All except for me. An accident had left me stranded, the sole human left on the once teeming planet. 

At first, the gods didn't notice my presence. They were too busy mourning the loss of their worshippers and fighting amongst themselves. But soon their gazes turned to the sole inhabitant of their domain.

Zeus was the first to appear before me, thunderbolt in hand, demanding sacrifices and praise. I refused, clinging to the science and reason that had helped humanity escape this place. His wrath was fearsome, but ultimately empty. His powers meant nothing without anyone to worship them.

Next came Thor, his hammer Mjolnir crackling with energy as he boasted of the protection and favor he could provide. I needed none of it. Like Zeus, his strength was meaningless without worshippers to wield it for. He raged at my defiance but ultimately slunk back to Asgard in defeat.

The pattern continued with the rest. Anubis, Shiva, Amaterasu. All promised blessings and threats in turn, eager to claim my soul as a trophy to fill the void left by humanity's departure. None succeeded. Their powers were hollow without purpose or meaning. They lacked any strength to compel worship from me.

In time, a realization dawned on the gods that was more destructive than any mortal weapon could be. They needed us far more than we ever needed them. We gave them form and purpose. Without us, they were nothing but vain shadows clinging to a world that had moved on.

One by one, the gods began to fade from the world, slipping into the void of non-existence from which humanity's imagination had once conjured them. Their twilight was silent, unmourned and unmournable.  

Alone again, a sole human on an empty world, I felt at peace surveying the lands that were now free of the gods' grasping hands. The age of man had ended. Now the age of gods was over too. Their millennia of cobbling together meaning were done. The world was silent, and it was good.
