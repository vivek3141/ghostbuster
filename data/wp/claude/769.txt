The room was dimly lit, as always. I liked it that way. The shadows helped me focus. I stared intently at the photos taped in a meticulous grid on my wall. My beautiful subjects, frozen in time. Their smiles, their eyes, every detail of their faces burned into my memory. 

But one was missing. The bottom right corner was empty. My collection was incomplete. The asymmetry disturbed me, clawed at my mind. I had to find another.

I spent hours analyzing social media profiles, looking for the right one. Flipping through photos like items on a menu, dismissing one after another. Too plain. Too silly. Too serious. Then I found her. Auburn hair, dimpled chin, a scattering of barely noticeable freckles. She was ideal. Her username was Clairdelune84. I smiled, and the hunt began.

It took weeks of planning. I befriended her online with a carefully curated profile of my own. I knew everything about her routines, habits, and tastes by the time I suggested we meet in person. She agreed readily. Of course. My false charm and wit had paid off.

When I saw her walking toward the coffee shop, a jolt of joy and anticipation shot through me. Even more perfect than her photos. I shook her hand, gave her my most disarming smile, and suggested a walk through the nearby park. She agreed, clearly already enchanted. My heart raced as I thought of filling that empty space on my wall.

Once we were alone on a secluded trail, her eyes changed. The first glimmers of doubt and fear appeared. She knew something was wrong. But by then it was too late. I overpowered her easily and injected a sedative into her neck.  Her body went limp in my arms.

I added Clairdelune84 to my collection that evening. As I straightened the photos on my wall and gazed at her still, peaceful face, a sense of deep satisfaction filled me. My work was complete. The asymmetry was corrected. All was well in my dim little world. Until, of course, another empty space emerged. And the hunt began again.
