The crumbled ruins of the orthodontist's office tower before me. I sighed, my braces still firmly affixed to my teeth even after the apocalypse. At 17, I just wanted to get these metal trappings off so I could at least have a chance of surviving without looking like a total dork.

As I picked through the remains of the waiting room, I suddenly heard a loud bang coming from a closet. I froze in place, grabbing a sharp tool from the debris. The door burst open and out stumbled a disheveled looking scientist, coughing. 

"Thank goodness, a normal human!" he exclaimed. He introduced himself as Dr. Mendez, a biologist who was trapped in his lab when the outbreak hit. "I've been surviving on protein bars for a week but I've done it - I've developed a zombie virus antidote!"

My eyes went wide. This was the break we had been hoping for. "Quick, we need to get you to the refugee camp. They have a lab there, you can mass produce the antidote!"

We raced down to my motorcycle, plowing through crowds of zombies along the way. At the refugee camp, Dr. Mendez was able to replicate his antidote. Planes flew over major cities, dropping antidote bombs. Within days, the zombies virus was wiped out. 

In the aftermath, Dr. Mendez and I received a hero's welcome. "How can we ever repay you?" the camp general asked. 

I smiled, pointing to my braces. "I just came looking for an orthodontist. Think you can help me with these?"  

Dr. Mendez grinned. "It would be my pleasure." Saving the world was reward enough, but finally being brace-free? That felt just as good.
