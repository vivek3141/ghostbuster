The old clock on the wall ticked steadily as I went about my morning routine. Wake up, brush my teeth, take a shower, get dressed, and head downstairs for some breakfast. It was all very ordinary and uneventful, just like every other day. Little did I know that today my ordinary life would get turned upside down.

As I poured my cereal into a bowl, I suddenly felt a strange tingling sensation in my fingers. I looked down and to my utter shock saw tiny sparks of electricity dancing between my fingertips. I yelped in surprise. Where did that come from? I stared at my hands in disbelief. Did I just generate electricity? This had to be some kind of weird fluke. I cautiously tried snapping my fingers together and once again saw little zaps of electricity.

My mind raced as I tried to make sense of what was happening. There could only be one explanation, as bizarre and illogical as it seemed. I must have randomly developed some kind of superpower to generate electricity. Like something out of a comic book. But how was this possible? And why now after living my whole unexceptional life as a completely ordinary human?

I spent the rest of the morning experimenting with my newfound ability, working to understand the limits and intricacies of this power. I could generate enough electricity to power a light bulb, but anything bigger than that would quickly drain me. I had to be careful not to zap myself or start any fires. This was dangerous if mishandled.  

Part of me was excited at the prospect of having a superpower, while another part was anxious about the responsibility. Should I use this ability to help people or keep it hidden to protect myself? For now, I decided to keep it a secret until I better understood what I could do.

When it was time to head to my job at the library, I did my best to push aside thoughts of my strange new power and focus on my daily tasks. But all day my mind kept wandering as I re-shelved books and helped patrons at the front desk. I was distracted and on edge, worried I might accidentally zap someone or something. I made it through the day without incident but felt a mixture of relief and apprehension about what might come next with this bizarre new chapter of my life. 

Little did I know that my ordinary little life was never going to be the same again, now that I had been gifted—or perhaps cursed—with this random power from who knows where. The power to generate electricity at my fingertips, for better or worse. An utterly un asked for responsibility that I now had to grapple with and determine how to responsibly wield. My ordinary day had taken an extraordinary turn
