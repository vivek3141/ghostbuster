The xenon-lit room throbbed with music as the party continued into the wee hours of the morning. Yet Victor was focused on one thing: finding a woman to go home with. His usual  charming ways seemed to be failing him tonight though.

Victor surveyed the room, hoping to spy an attractive, single lady. However, the only women that remained were obviously taken or not his type. His usual techniques were not working. He realized with annoyance that he might leave this party alone. 

Walking over to the makeshift bar, Victor ordered another vodka tonic. As the bartender handed him the drink, Victor noticed a woman down the end of the bar. Though partially hidden in the shadows, he could tell she was beautiful. But was she single?

Approaching cautiously, Victor smiled. “Hi, I’m Victor. What’s your name?” 

The woman turned, her violet eyes gleaming in the low light. “Ursula” she replied. 

Victor grinned, his confidence flooding back. “What a lovely name, Ursula. Can I buy you a drink?”

To his delight, Ursula accepted. As they talked, Victor became entranced by this woman. Ursula was charming and witty, with an almost hypnotic quality to her voice. He found himself eagerly awaiting her next word, not even noticing as other partygoers started saying their goodbyes for the night.  

Though stories flowed between them for nearly an hour, Ursula remained somewhat mysterious. Victor realized with a jolt of panic that he didn’t want this night to end. “Would you...like to get out of here?” He finally ventured, heart pounding.

Ursula considered his offer, then nodded with a coy smile. Victor helped her down from her barstool, thrilled at his good fortune. As they left the empty bar, he asked “Your place or mine?” 

Turning to him, Ursula replied silkily “Mine. I think you’ll find I have many more...surprises in store for you.” Her violet eyes flashed as she led Victor into the night, sealing his sensual fate. He followed willingly, unaware of what was yet to come. The game was just beginning.
