I turned off my phone and stowed it in the cockpit locker, preparing for another routine flight from Los Angeles to New York. As captain of the flight, it was my responsibility to ensure the safety of the 300 passengers and crew on board. No distractions allowed. 

But in the moment before my phone powered down, a text from my wife Emma flashed on the screen: "We need to talk. I'm worried about the baby."

My heart seized in my chest. Emma was eight months pregnant with our first child. What could possibly be wrong? The urge to turn my phone back on and call her was overwhelming. But I couldn't. I had to focus.

As we taxied to the runway, I tried to reassure myself. Emma was a worrier by nature, she was probably concerned over something minor. But my mind raced with a flood of terrifying thoughts. What if she was in early labor? What if there were complications? 

The co-pilot glanced over, noticing my clenched jaw and white knuckles gripping the controls. "Everything okay, captain?"

I gave him a tight nod, not yet ready to voice my worries. I had to compartmentalize. Get the plane in the air, then assess the situation.

The next six hours in the air were agony. I replayed Emma's message in my mind on a torturous loop. The unknown possibilities haunted me. My co-pilot could tell I was distracted and tense, though he didn't pry. He handled more of the communication with air traffic control, for which I was grateful.

Finally on our descent into JFK, I turned my phone back on. There were three messages from Emma and a voicemail. My heart pounding, I called her immediately.

"What's going on? I got your message and have been going out of my mind. Are you okay? Is the baby all right?" I fired questions at her, panic seeping into my voice.

"We're fine, we're fine," Emma said. "I'm sorry for worrying you. I slipped on the stairs this morning and fell. I called the doctor right away and everything checked out okay, the baby's heartbeat is strong. I just wanted you to know before you took off. I should have realized that message would freak you out, I wasn't thinking. I'm so sorry."

I exhaled, leaning back in my seat, relief flooding through me as we landed safely on the runway. My family was safe. The rest I could handle. Emma and I still had plenty to discuss, but for now, that was enough.
