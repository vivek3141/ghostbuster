I open my eyes in a panic, sweat beading and then falling down my face. I look around and the sun is shining through the maroon curtains of my studio apartment. Everything seems to be as I left it yesterday afternoon, but there is a heavy, unfamiliar air in the room.

I notice the throw cover I lazily hung to separate my twin size bed from the rest of the apartment has been ripped to the ground, and that the kitchen faucet rhythmically drips against the cold steel sink. I was alone last night like I always am, I think. No one has been here but me in over three months. 

My heart begins to race as the realization sets in that something isn’t right. I slowly sit up in bed, clutching the thin blanket around me, and scan the room for any signs of an intruder. The front door is still locked from the inside, and the windows are all tightly shut. Everything appears untouched, yet the atmosphere feels disturbed.

I slide off the side of the bed and grab the baseball bat I keep under it, holding it up and ready to swing as I make my way around the corner into the kitchenette and living area. The bare bulb in the overhead light flickers on, revealing no one hiding behind the futon or in the pantry. But when I get to the sink, I see it: a single, unwashed dish sitting in the drying rack, a fork resting on its edge. 

Ice floods my veins. I live alone. I always do my dishes immediately after eating. That dish and fork were not there when I went to bed.

In a frenzy, I rush to check the front door again, confirming it is still locked. But when I turn back around, in the far corner of the room behind an old bookcase, a floorboard creaks. Someone is here, and they know I have realized it.  

I raise the bat, preparing to strike. “Come out now or I’m calling the police!” I shout, hoping the fear in my voice isn’t too apparent.  For a moment, all is silent. Then, a dark figure emerges, hands raised. I stagger back in terror and shock at the familiar face staring back at me - a face I never thought I'd see again.

"Hello, son," my father says grimly. A chill runs down my spine as I face the man who abandoned me as a child now standing in my apartment, uninvited and unannounced after 20 long years.
