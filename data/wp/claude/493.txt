The old salvage ship cruised into Earth's solar system, battered and dented from countless voyages. Captain J'karr peered out at the little blue planet, third from its sun. 

"Sensors show technology sufficient for basic spaceflight," his first mate S'leen reported. "They may have parts we can use."

J'karr rubbed his lower tentacles together in anticipation. Fresh parts meant more fuel, means more voyages. He steered the ship into a high orbit above the planet and transmitted a message.

"Greetings. We come in peace seeking discarded technology to sustain our ship. Please do not be alarmed."

After a tense wait, a reply came. "Hello...alien visitors. This is Houston space control. We...welcome you to Earth. We may be able to provide some spare parts to assist you, if you share details about your craft's needs."

J'karr transmitted their list, basic components but expensive to replicae. The humans suggested a few options in a nearby space junkyard. The ship descended and retrieved the parts. Fresh fuel cells, an intact comms array, perfect!

"Thank you for your generosity," J'karr transmitted. "Is there any technology you seek in exchange?" 

"We appreciate your offer," Houston replied. "However, our civilization is still quite young. We have much to learn before venturing far into space. Safe travels!"

As the ship cruised into the inky blackness, J'karr felt content. Not every species they encountered was so giving. He set a course for the familiar conflict zones, where warships frequently left behind debris. Perhaps they'd get lucky again. The humans would make natural salvagers and traders, when they were ready. An instinct told J'karr this wouldn't be their last visit to that little blue world.
