It was only January 2nd and my resolution to exercise daily had already fallen apart. I woke up exhausted after staying up late watching TV the night before. The gym seemed too far away and too crowded. I decided to skip it, just for one day. 

I felt guilty as I drove past the gym on my way to work. At lunch, I went out for pizza with coworkers instead of eating the healthy salad I had packed. In the evening, I was too tired to cook and ordered takeout instead. Exercise? Not a chance. I plopped onto the couch and turned on the TV.

As midnight approached, I realized with dismay that I had failed at my resolution in less than 48 hours. I had let excuses and laziness get the best of me. I vowed to start over again tomorrow, to not let one failure derail my goal to establish a healthy habit. But a voice in my head wondered if I really had the motivation and willpower to change. Did I have what it takes to follow through? I pushed the doubts aside as I headed to bed, hoping that when I woke up tomorrow, determination and perseverance would prevail over sloth and frailty of resolve. A new day, a new start - that was what I needed. Another chance to build the strength and grit to achieve what I set my mind to do. The battle was not over yet. I would fight on.
