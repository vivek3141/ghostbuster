The first time it happened, I thought I was losing my mind. 

I was in the middle of a meeting at work when suddenly everything paused. My coworkers froze in place, mouths half-open, papers hovering in mid-air where they had been casually passed across the table. Even the clock on the wall seemed stuck in time. Everything was utterly still and silent.

Except for me. I remained unfrozen, sitting there stunned at what was unfolding around me. I waved my hands in front of my colleagues' faces, snapped my fingers next to their ears, even shook them by the shoulders, but nothing. They were like statues. 

After a few frantic minutes of this, time abruptly resumed again. My coworkers picked up where they left off, completely unaware that anything strange had occurred. I was left rattled and questioning my own sanity.

Over the next few days, it kept happening, always when I least expected it. On the subway, a woman would freeze with a bite of sandwich raised to her lips. At the park, a dog would halt mid-leap to catch a Frisbee, suspended gracefully in the air with its mouth open and tail waving. 

I began to realize this bizarre phenomenon seemed centered around me. I was the only one unaffected. For some reason, time stopped for everyone else on Earth, while I experienced those moments as an unfrozen observer.

Once I accepted I wasn't losing my mind, my initial panic gave way to curiosity. What was really going on here? I started conducting little experiments during the time stops to try and find some answers.

I discovered I could move objects and people around, and they would remain where I placed them once time resumed. But if I touched someone's bare skin, they would instantly unfreeze, with no memory of the time that had passed. I had to be careful not to directly contact anyone.

During one stop, I ventured outside to find utter pandemonium. Car crashes had frozen mid-impact, planes hung suspended in the sky, and chaotic scenes were captured everywhere like some bizarre motionless dioramas. I realized with dawning horror that if time remained stopped permanently, life as we knew it would be unsustainable. Everything depended on the normal flow of moments to function. 

I knew then I had to find a way to reverse whatever this was and get time moving again. But where did I even start? I was just an ordinary guy with no clue how something of this magnitude could happen. I wracked my brain to think of anything unusual preceding the first time stop, some event that might have triggered this.

Then it hit me. The solar eclipse. There had been a total solar eclipse just before the first time it happened. Could that be the connection? As implausible as it seemed, it was the only thing out of the ordinary I could identify as a potential catalyst. 

The next time the world paused around me, I put my theory to the test. I found my way to a radio observatory, where astronomers had temporarily halted their observations of the sun. I stared directly at the sun through the powerful telescopes, waiting to see if anything would change.

After a few long minutes, time sputtered back to life again. My theory was right. Somehow, the eclipse had caused time to stop, and observing the sun had restarted it. I had found a way to press play on the whole world again. 

From that day onward, during each time stop I make my way to the nearest observatory or telescope. I focus the full power of its lens on the sun until slowly but surely time awakens once more. And life on Earth continues marching on as usual, thanks to one ordinary man in a most extraordinary circumstance.
