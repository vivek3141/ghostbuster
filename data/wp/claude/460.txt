The old warehouse loomed over us, casting shadows in the pale moonlight. Jake and I had been exploring the abandoned buildings for years, but this one was different. There were strange symbols and warnings painted on the boarded-up entrance. 

"I don't know about this, man," I said, a chill running down my spine.

"Come on, don't be such a wuss," Jake said. "One of us is gonna have to test it out. It's probably just some old hobo's leftover junk. Or a prank by stupid teenagers."

I knew Jake was trying to play it cool, but I could see the apprehension in his eyes too. "Maybe we should just call it a night," I suggested.

"And wonder forever what was inside? No way. I'm going in," Jake said. He found a loose board and pried it off, wriggling through the gap. 

I waited for a few minutes, nerves fraying in the eerie silence. "Jake?" I whispered. No response.

I took a deep breath and peeled off another board to follow him inside. The interior was pitch dark. I turned on my flashlight, the pale beam cutting through the blackness. "Jake, this isn't funny. Where are you?"

A shuffling sound came from the far corner. I swung my light over and it landed on Jake, who stood motionless, staring at something on the wall. As I moved closer, a massive symbol came into view, painted in ominous red splatters. 

Jake turned to me, eyes wide with fear. "I think we should go," he said, his voice trembling. We both scrabbled through the gap and ran as fast as we could from that place.

We agreed never to speak of that night again. But the images still haunt my dreams. What was that symbol, and what did it really mean? Some doors are meant to remain locked, some secrets best left unlearned. One of us tested it out, like we said we would. And I think coming out alive was our luckiest break. We won't be tempting fate a second time. The end.
