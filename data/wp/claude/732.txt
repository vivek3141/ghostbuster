I slowly opened my eyes as the morning sun peeked through the blinds. Something felt off but I couldn't quite place it. I turned to see if my wife was still sleeping next to me, but instead of her familiar form, there was a cardboard cut-out of her in a peaceful sleeping pose.  

I blinked again, confused at the sight before me. Her chest wasn't moving up and down with the gentle rhythm of breath. Her eyes were closed but unmoving. It looked like her in every detail but felt hollow and empty.

Panic started to rise in my chest as I leapt out of bed and ran to my kids' rooms down the hall. Instead of my son and daughter still tucked into their beds, there were cardboard versions of them, their little chests also eerily still.

I pinched myself, hoping to wake up from this bizarre dream, but nothing changed. I was surrounded by cardboard versions of my family with their familiar smiles and casual poses but no life or warmth within them.

I stumbled down the stairs and looked out the front window. Everything seemed normal at first as I gazed at the row of houses on my street. But then I noticed there was no movement anywhere. No neighbors walking their dogs or grabbing their newspapers. The world looked like a still life painting. 

With dread filling my heart, I flung open the front door to see cardboard cut-outs of all my neighbors placed on their lawns or driveways, arranged as if in the midst of their familiar routines. A jogger forever frozen mid-stride. A dog walker with a grin that would never change.

I started running down the street, shouting "Hello!" as panic rose into terror. There was no one. Nothing but the hollow shells of the people I knew. I was completely, utterly alone.

In that moment, I realized this was my life now. A world full of cardboard memories, frozen in time but empty of life. The thought was too devastating to bear. I collapsed to the ground, sobbing with the grief of all that I had lost in the blink of an eye. The love and warmth and messiness of humanity was gone, replaced with a cold, flat world of smiles and gestures without substance. 

As tears streamed down my face, I heard a faint rustling sound behind me. I turned around slowly, afraid of what I might see. But there, coming down their front walkway, were my neighbors. Not the cardboard versions - my actual, living, breathing neighbors. 

Relief flooded my body as my neighbor called out "Good morning!" with a confused wave. I leapt up and hugged her tightly, taking in the feeling of human contact. She stiffened, startled by my sudden embrace. Over her shoulder, I could see the rest of the neighborhood begin to wake and move about. Doors opening, dogs barking, the world springing back to life.

It had only been a dream. A terrifying glimpse into a world void of life and love. I have never felt more grateful to find myself surrounded by all the messy, beautiful chaos of humanity. My life, and my world, was whole again.
