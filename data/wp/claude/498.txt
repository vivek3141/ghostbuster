I woke with a start. The room was dimly lit by the first rays of morning sun peeking through the blinds. At the foot of my bed stood a figure, startlingly red, with horns and a tail. The devil. 

His eyes locked onto mine, and a sly grin spread across his face. He tapped my foot with a long, pointed nail and said in a gravelly voice, "You're it."

Then he dissolved into a puff of red smoke and sulfur.

I bolted upright, heart pounding. What the hell was that? I must have been dreaming. I looked around the room but there was no evidence anything had been there. No strange smells lingered. I lifted the covers to check my foot and found nothing. 

A dream, for sure. My overactive imagination. I got up and ready for work, pushing the bizarre vision out of my mind. 

The day proceeded as normal until I was walking down the sidewalk during my lunch break. A person bumped into my shoulder as they rushed by, not even pausing to apologize. Annoyed, I turned to watch them go—and froze in my tracks. The figure hurrying into the crowd wore all red and had a long pointed tail swaying behind them.

I stood stunned for a moment before shaking myself out of it. Another trick of the eyes. I went to a cafe and sat down, heart still pounding. What was happening to me?

Over the next few days, more “sightings” occurred. Glimpses of red in a sea of people. A sinister pointed tail rounding a corner. Eyes catching mine with a knowing glance. I became increasingly unsettled, jumping at small noises and startling at shadows. 

Then a week after that first morning, I woke before dawn to use the restroom. Returning to bed, I stopped short. At the foot of my bed, two glowing red eyes stared at me.

In a flash I flipped on the light switch, but the room was empty. My heart threatened to burst from my chest. It couldn't be...could it?

A raspy chuckle sounded in my ear. "You're it," the voice repeated.

I screamed.
