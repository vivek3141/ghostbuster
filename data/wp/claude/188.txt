It has been six months since I first teleported and I have been able to control it for three months. I haven't told anyone, and yet I get a bad feeling about that man who has followed me to work for the past week. 

My teleportation ability manifested unexpectedly one night when I was walking home from work. In the blink of an eye, I found myself instantly transported three blocks away. At first, I thought I was losing my mind. But after a few more spontaneous teleportations, I started to experiment and practice. I discovered I could teleport on command, visualizing the location in my mind's eye.

I have kept this ability a secret, afraid of how people might react or try to exploit me. But now, I fear that secret may be in jeopardy. For the last week, I have noticed the same nondescript man following me to and from work every day. At first, I told myself I was just being paranoid. But his presence fills me with a inexplicable dread.

Today, he followed me as usual on my walk to work. But instead of teleporting directly into my office as I do most days, I teleported to the adjacent alleyway to see if he was truly following me. Within a minute, the man walked past the alley, looking around perplexed. My heart sank as my fears were confirmed. 

As I teleported into my office, my mind raced. Who was this man and how did he discover my ability? I resolved to confront him to find out his intentions. When I left work that evening, I walked a few blocks, giving the illusion I was heading home as normal. Sure enough, he emerged and began to follow me. I teleported behind him and took a deep breath. "Why are you following me?" I demanded.

The man spun around, shock and confusion spreading across his face. But as he registered my presence, his expression shifted to a sly grin. "I was wondering when you were going to finally ask me that," he said ominously. My heart dropped as I realized this sinister man with unknown motives had been aware of my ability all along.
