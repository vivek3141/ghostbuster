The old prison was rumored to be haunted. Joe, one of the veteran guards, didn't believe in ghosts but enjoyed perpetuating the myth to spook the new recruits. His favorite tale was of a small spirit medium who had been falsely imprisoned in the women's cell block decades ago. According to legend, her ghost still wandered the halls trying to prove her innocence.  

One night during a particularly long and boring graveyard shift, Joe hatched a plan to have some fun with the rookie on duty with him, Mark. There were no inmates causing trouble, so Joe suggested they do a quick patrol of the abandoned women's wing. Mark nervously agreed.

As they walked the dark hall, Joe started dropping hints about strange noises he was hearing. He told Mark to look for any signs of paranormal activity. Mark jumped at every creak and rattle, his eyes darting around for any hints of spirits. 

Joe led them to the old medium's former cell. "This is where she spent her final days, they say her ghost appears most often here," Joe said ominously. He had hidden a speaker inside the cell earlier and began playing a recording of eerie whispers and moans he had downloaded to his phone.

Mark went pale and began to shake. "What was that? Did you hear that?" Joe feigned ignorance. The sounds intensified, and items strewn about the cell began to move and tumble by themselves. 

Mark shrieked in terror and bolted from the wing, running as fast as he could out of the prison. Joe doubled over with laughter at the prank. His mirth was interrupted by a strange sensation, as though he was being watched. He felt a chill in the air and the hairs on his arm stood up. 

A small orb of light emerged in the cell and began circling in front of Joe's face, increasing in speed until it was a blur. He stumbled backwards, suddenly not quite so skeptical about ghosts. The orb then flew down the hall before disappearing through a wall.

Joe raced after Mark, catching up to him a block away from the prison, breathlessly recounting what he saw. Mark stared in stunned silence. 

Finally Mark shook his head. "You must have a small medium at large," he said flatly. Joe groaned at the terrible pun. His prank had backfired in a way he never expected, and he was never quite sure if they had encountered a real spirit that night or if Mark had outwitted him. Either way, the old prison didn't seem quite so boring anymore.
