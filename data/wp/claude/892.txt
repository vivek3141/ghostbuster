Freddy sharpened his razor-gloved fingers and cackled with glee. His next victim, Mark, was a habitual lucid dreamer. Freddy relished the challenge of killing someone aware they were dreaming. 

Mark went to sleep, realizing he was in a dream as soon as he saw the familiar boiler room. “I know this is a dream, Kruger. You can't hurt me.”

Freddy emerged from the shadows, slashing at the air. “We'll see about that!” He lunged at Mark.

Mark remained calm. “You have no power over me. This is my dream.”

Freddy snarled. His razor fingers passed through Mark like air. No blood, no cry of pain.

Freddy felt a flicker of doubt. He attacked again, with no impact. “Why won't you die?” he roared.

“Because you're just a dream character,” Mark replied. “I'm still in control.” With a wave of his hand, Mark transformed the boiler room into a sunny meadow.

Freddy stumbled, weakened by the light. The landscape warped around him at Mark's whims. Freddy was powerless. 

Freddy realized the tables had turned. His usual tricks wouldn't work. As long as Mark knew it was a dream, Freddy could not touch him. 

Freddy felt fear for the first time in decades. He was at the mercy of this dreamer who could bend the dream to his will. 

“Leave now,” Mark commanded. “You have no power here.”

“No!” Freddy protested. But he could already feel the dream fading as Mark's mind awakened. Freddy scrambled to slash at thedreamer one last time, but it was too late.

Freddy found himself banished to the void between dreams. Mark's realization of control had defeated him. Freddy roared in frustration, his razors gleaming with rage. He would wait to enter the next dreamer's mind, hungry for revenge. And he would be more wary of self-aware dreamers from now on. His usual tricks were powerless against their lucid minds.
