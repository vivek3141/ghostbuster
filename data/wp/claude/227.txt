I walked into the ornate briefing room in the Capitol building, still getting used to my new title: Senator. After years of hard campaigning, I had won my race and was eager to get to work serving the people of my state. 

As I entered, a few senior Senators were gathered around a large oak table. "Welcome, we've been expecting you," said the Senate Majority leader. "Before you get started, there are some things you need to know. The truth about how Washington really works. "

I sat down, confused but curious. The Majority leader leaned in and spoke in a hushed tone. "The last several decades of US politics, the partisan rancor, the government dysfunction—it's all been carefully orchestrated. We've been putting on a show to generate as much controversy and strife as possible."

"To what end?" I asked incredulously. 

"To harness energy," he replied. "Not solar or wind, but the kinetic energy of the Founding Fathers spinning in their graves. As they roll faster and faster, it's a limitless source of power we've been tapping into for years."

I stared at him, speechless, waiting for the punchline. But none came. The other Senators nodded gravely. 

He continued, "Think about it—endless filibusters, brinksmanship over the debt ceiling, a broken Supreme Court nomination process. Each controversy makes the Founders spin just a little bit faster. At this point, we have them rolling at several thousand RPMs. Enough to power all of Washington DC."

"This is absurd," I said. "I don't believe it and neither will the public if word of this gets out."

The Majority leader shook his head. "This has been kept strictly confidential for decades. But now that you're a part of this Senate, you deserve to know the truth, and to benefit from the power we've secured and will continue producing, so long as politics remains dysfunctional and broken, as designed."  

I left the room dizzy and dismayed. I ran for Senate to change a broken institution, not fuel its dysfunction. There had to be a way I could help make government work again and override whatever perpetual motion machines these Senators had devised – before the Founding Fathers reached escape velocity and spun out of our orbit altogether. I knew my path forward wouldn't be easy, but for the first time I saw my purpose clearly: to make Washington boring again.
