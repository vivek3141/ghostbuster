The old clocktower chimed midnight as Mark walked through the abandoned field. His flashlight flickered across overgrown weeds and rusted farm equipment, remnants of the past. 

His phone buzzed. "You're late. Hurry up." His boss did not like tardiness. Mark stumbled on a hidden root and dropped his flashlight. "Great," he muttered.

The field seemed different in the dark. Eerie shadows appeared more sinister. An owl hooted ominously. The wind rustled, whispering secrets of times gone by.

Mark's neck prickled. He felt watched. Impossible, he thought, dismissing his fear. Still, he walked faster. 

After several minutes of struggling through the overgrowth, he arrived at the derelict barn. His boss stood in the doorway, silhouetted by a lantern's golden glow.

"You're nearly 30 minutes late. I don't tolerate lateness," his boss growled. Mark stammered an apology and hurried inside.

A familiar musky scent embraced himâ€”hay, dust, and livestock long gone. Shadows flickered across stalls strewn with debris. 

His boss pointed to a loose floorboard. "It's under there. You know what to do."

Mark knelt, pried up the floorboard, and retrieved the package. His boss snatched it. "I'll be in touch." The door slammed, enveloping Mark in darkness.

Alone, Mark's thoughts turned to his family at home in their beds, unaware of the precarious nature of his side job. He could lose everything if caught. His boss didn't make idle threats. 

The wind intensified outside, shrieking as if in protest. The hairs on his neck stood up again. He shook off the feeling of unseen eyes and headed for the exit. 

Lightning flashed, followed by booming thunder. The storm predicted earlier had arrived. As rain thundered down, Mark sprinted across the field, sliding in the mud, scrambling to return home before sunrise.

His dangerous liaison complete for another night, Mark vowed again to find a legitimate way to provide for his family. He knew this path led only to destruction. Still, he trudged on through the storm, away from the abandoned farm under cover of darkness, waiting for the new day to dawn.
