You're thinking of asking out that girl in your Religious Studies class. Also, you're pretty sure she's a God.  

Amy was like no one else in my Comparative Religions class. For starters, she seemed to glow with an otherworldly radiance. When she walked into the room, it felt like the sun had just risen. Her eyes were deep pools of wisdom and compassion. And when she spoke about faith and spirituality, even the professor seemed captivated by her profound insights.

I had been working up the courage for weeks to ask Amy out for coffee. But how exactly do you ask out a deity? I was a mere mortal, a lowly undergrad. What if she could see into my unworthy soul and perceive my hidden faults and frailties? 

Today's lecture was on the Upanishads, ancient Hindu texts that explore the nature of Brahman, the supreme cosmic spirit. Amy's hand shot up constantly, each question or comment more illuminating than the last. By the end of class, I was in a state of bliss just being in the same room as her divine presence.

As students began filing out, I saw my chance. It was now or never. I approached Amy, my heart pounding in my chest. Up close, her radiance was almost blinding. I took a deep breath and dove in.

"Amy, I was wondering if you'd like to get coffee sometime?" I stammered. 

She tilted her head and gazed at me with those infinite, all-knowing eyes. I felt naked before her, all my secrets laid bare. After what seemed like an eternity, she spoke.

"I'd like that."

I blinked in surprise. "You would?"

Amy smiled beatifically. "I may have certain...spiritual gifts, but I'm still a human being. A coffee date sounds lovely."

I couldn't believe my luck. A coffee date with a veritable goddess! We agreed to meet at a cafe the next day. I walked out of the classroom in a blissful daze. 

Perhaps Amy was a Bodhisattva, a being of infinite compassion who comes down from the heavens to walk among mortals. Or maybe she was a living embodiment of divine wisdom, like the goddess Saraswati. Either way, for our coffee date, she had chosen to meet me not as a deity, but as a woman. I was the luckiest man alive. My love life was about to get very mystical.
