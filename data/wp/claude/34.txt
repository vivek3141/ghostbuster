The bus was crowded, as usual for this time of the morning. I squeezed past passengers to find an empty seat near the back, avoiding eye contact with the spectral figures hovering by each person. The soul escorts were out in force today. Their wispy forms filled the air, trailing silver threads that connected them to a living person. An omen of impending death for each mortal they attended.

I slid into a seat, hoping for a peaceful ride without the grim reminders of mortality surrounding me. But my gasp caught in my throat as I glanced around the bus. Not just a few soul escorts—they were everywhere. At least two dozen of the cloaked escorts drifted up and down the narrow aisle or lingered next to passengers.   

This couldn’t be right. Never had I seen so many gathered in one place before, not even in an old folke's home. My heart raced as the implications set in. All these people, at least half the bus, were fated to die today? Impossible. It couldn’t be true. I rubbed my eyes, hoping the vision would clear.  

It didn’t. The escorts remained, carrying on their silent vigil. Their numbers seemed to grow each time I looked away and back again. Panic welled up within me. All these lives at stake—there had to be something I could do. A warning I could give or a disaster I could help prevent. But what? I had no details to offer, no way of knowing what form tragedy would take. Only the hazy glimpse of so many escorts patiently waiting to guide souls into the afterlife.

The bus rattled down the street, every jerk and bounce rattling my nerves. At each stop more escorts streamed on board, their presence a chilling sign of what awaited down the road. I wracked my brain for anything that could explain the strange sight. Nothing came to mind except the grim and impossible conclusion I fought desperately against.

Two stops remained before my usual one. Nearly all the seats now hosted at least one escort. I could barely see others through the misty forms. My own mortality felt very frail and fleeting in that moment. I longed to get off the bus, to escape the ominous fate it seemed to carry. 

At last my stop came into view. I scrambled up and lurched for the exit, bursting through the doors in a rush. The bus pulled away, carrying its cargo of souls unknowingly bound for somewhere else. Leaving me shaken on the sidewalk, staring after it and wondering if there was any way I could have changed the fate of all those people and the escorts guiding them on their final journey.
