It had been the week from hell. On Monday morning, I was greeted with a pink slip on my desk, along with a curt 'your services are no longer needed' from my boss. Great, fired for no good reason after five years of loyal service. 

When I got home, my girlfriend Amy had changed her relationship status to 'it's complicated' and had been posting flirty messages and photos with her personal trainer all over social media. When I asked her about it, she threw a fit claiming it was my jealousy and lack of trust as always. Still, the way they were gazing into each other's eyes in those posts told me everything I needed to know. Cheating girlfriend, check.

To top it all off, I realized I was now 75 grand in student loan debt with rent a week past due and an empty fridge containing not even a single bottle of beer. At this point, I was almost laughing at the ridiculousness of the situation. What else could possibly go wrong this week?

In the midst of this turbulence, a new email arrived in my inbox. The subject line caught my attention. "Would you like to change the difficulty? Current setting: Very Hard." Must be some kind of scam or spam, but curiosity got the better of me. 

I opened the email which contained just a single link leading to what looked like an online gaming site. At the top, in bold letters were the words "Welcome to the Game of Life. Adjust your difficulty setting here." Below were several options from "Very Easy" to "Nightmare."

This was bizarre. Some kind of prank maybe? I decided to entertain it for amusement's sake and clicked the option for "Easy." The page refreshed, and a new message popped up: "Difficulty setting updated. Enjoy the easier levels!" Weird. I shook my head and went to bed, exhausted from the events of the worst week I'd had in ages.

The next morning, I awoke to a loud pounding at the door. I open it to find my boss, looking furious and red-faced. "Where were you yesterday?! You think you can just vanish whenever you feel like it? You're lucky I don't fire you on the spot!"  Wait, what? Wasn't I fired just yesterday? "I'm...sorry?" I stuttered, "I thought you let me go, I must have misunderstood." His expression softened. "Misunderstood? Just get to work, and we'll say no more about it."

I then checked my phone to see not a single message from Amy. All those posts with the personal trainer were gone like they had never existed. I shot her a text, "Amy, are we okay?" She replied instantly, "Of course! Why wouldn't we be? Stop being so paranoid, you know I love you." 

What alternate dimension had I woken up in? Was any of this real? Then I remembered - the email with the difficulty setting change. Did adjusting that slider actually impact my reality? There was only one way to find out. I replied to the message as originally received:

"Would you like to change the difficulty? Current setting: Easy."  The same link appeared again. I moved the slider up a notch to "Normal."  The page refreshed with an updated message: "Difficulty setting changed to 'Normal'. Your life will proceed as usual with the typical ups and downs."

I leaned back in my chair, staring slack-jawed at the screen. How was this possible?  A knock at the door interrupted my trance. I opened it to find my landlord with a confused look on his face. "Just stopped by to see if you needed more time to pay the rent, but it looks like you already took care of it. My mistake!" 

It seemed I had discovered a way to reset and adjust my reality with a few clicks. A rush of possibilities flooded my mind. What now? Do I push on to 'Hard' and see if I can claw my way out of student loan debt? Crank it up to 'Nightmare' and try to prove my grit? Or do I slide it down to 'Very Easy' and coast through an ideal but hollow existence? The choice was mine. My life, my difficulty setting. What an odd yet compelling new reality I found myself in.
