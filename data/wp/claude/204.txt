The metallic doors slid open with a hiss as I entered the gleaming Regulator headquarters for the first time. My new uniform felt stiff and unfamiliar. I tugged at the collar, already feeling out of place. 

The atrium was filled with activity. Dozens of Regulators moved purposefully between workstations, not sparing a glance in my direction. I hesitated, unsure of where to go or what my first assignment might be. There didn't seem to be any orientation for new Regulators. We were expected to just jump right in.

I approached the nearest workstation, where a stern-looking woman was reviewing streams of data. "Hello, I'm the new Regulator. Reporting for duty."

She glanced up, annoyance flickering across her face. "Your workstation is over there," she said brusquely, gesturing to an empty station in the corner before returning to her work.

Puzzled, I made my way to the station she had indicated. The screen was dark. No instructions or information appeared when I sat down. "Uh, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing," I said to the woman. 

"Regulating, of course," she replied without looking up.

"Yes, but regulating what exactly?"

This time she didn't respond at all, engrossed in her work. I swiveled in my chair, observing the other Regulators. They were all focused on their own stations, occasionally adjusting dials or toggling switches with an air of extreme concentration. But as far as I could tell, nothing was actually happening.

A creeping suspicion began to form in my mind. I stood up and cleared my throat loudly. "Excuse me, everyone!" The room fell silent as the Regulators all turned to look at me, mild annoyance on their faces. My suspicion solidified into certainty.

"I just wanted to clarify something," I said. "None of you have any idea what you're supposed to be regulating either, do you?"

There was a long, awkward pause. Then, one by one, the Regulators began to shake their heads sheepishly, realizing the truth. The System had appointed us all to our prestigious positions, but had neglected to inform us of what exactly those positions entailed. The Regulator headquarters descended into confusion as we all began discussing the absurd situation we now found ourselves in.
