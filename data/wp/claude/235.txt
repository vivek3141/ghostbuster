The tapping of the keyboard was the only sound in the quiet room as I wrote another story in response to a writing prompt. This had become my nightly routine, a way to unwind after a long day and exercise my creative muscles. 

A sudden chill filled the air and a heavy hand grasped my shoulder. I jumped and spun around to see a figure towering over me dressed in an impeccable black suit. His eyes glowed an ominous red as he looked down at me.

“We need to talk,” the Devil said in a gravelly voice.

My heart raced. “W-what do you want?” I stammered.

He sighed. “Look, we need to talk about you putting me in every writing prompt response. I have better things to do than appear in all of your little short stories.”

I blinked in confusion. “What do you mean?”

The Devil rolled his eyes. “You always write me into your stories. Just look at your search history. Devil, Lucifer, Beelzebub...I'm in virtually every other tale! I have souls to corrupt and an underworld to run. I don't have time to star in your fiction.” 

Realization dawned on me. He was right, I did have a habit of turning to supernatural or otherworldly prompts for inspiration. And the Devil or demons seemed to frequently appear in my works, whether intentionally or not.

“I'm sorry,” I said. “I didn't realize I was overusing you as a character. I can dial it back if you'd prefer.”

“See that you do,” the Devil said. “I have given you leeway as an...avid fan of mine, shall we say. But my image cannot be tarnished through overexposure. Use your imagination—there are more villains and monsters in the sea and infinitely more stories to be told.”

With that, he vanished in a burst of flame, leaving behind the faint smell of brimstone. I turned back to my computer, resolve filling me. I would take the Devil's feedback to heart and broaden my writing horizons. My muse would not rely so heavily on the supernatural but would tap into the strange and uncanny in the everyday human experience. And I would give the Devil a well-deserved break.
