I stare at the small black tattoo on my wrist in disbelief. It's a series of letters and numbers—an identification code of some sort. But it wasn't supposed to be on me. 

Just a few hours ago, I signed the consent forms to be cloned. It was an exciting new scientific endeavor, and I was thrilled to participate and advance human progress. The doctor explained the entire cloning procedure in detail. At the end, he mentioned that the clone would receive a small tattoo marking it as the copy, just as a precaution. I nodded along, thinking it made sense.

After the procedure, I awoke groggy and disoriented. The first thing I noticed was the sharp pain in my wrist. And there, like a cruel joke, was the tattoo. 

My mind races with the implications. There must have been some sort of mix up during the procedure. Did they accidentally tattoo and clone me? Or did they purposefully mark and clone me instead of the clone? I feel queasy at the thought of another version of me walking around, believing itself to be the original.

I press the call button to summon the doctor, my panic rising with each passing second. He enters with a warm smile that fades as soon as he sees my expression. 

"There's been a mistake," I say, holding up my wrist. "I have the tattoo. Did you clone me by accident?"

The doctor's face turns white as he rushes forward to examine the tattoo himself. He shakes his head vehemently. "No, that's impossible. We took every precaution. You must have gotten mixed up with the clone during the recovery process."

"What clone?" I exclaim. "There's only me!" 

The doctor stammers, grasping for an explanation. But I can see the truth in his eyes—there is no clone. I've been duped.

Anger and fear flood my senses. I jump out of the bed, ignoring the doctor's protests, and run out of the room. I have to find answers for myself. 

The hallways of the research facility are empty. I go from room to room, finding extensive scientific equipment but no people. Eventually I stumble upon an observation area, and looking through the two-way mirror into the room below fills me with dread.

There I am, still unconscious on a hospital bed, peacefully sleeping off the effects of the drugs. Another me.

I pound frantically on the glass, shouting at the top of my lungs for help. The other me doesn't stir. I am trapped in my worst nightmare.

Despair washes over me. I've been violated and deceived in the worst possible way. My life as I know it will never be the same. As I sink to the floor, tears blurring my vision, I can only form one clear thought: they cloned me, but for what purpose? And where do I go from here?
