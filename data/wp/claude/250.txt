The night was dark and stormy, the perfect setting for the city to need saving. Jake sat in his small studio apartment, the cool jazz stylings of Miles Davis filling the room. His enhanced senses allowed him to hear each note with perfect clarity, following the syncopated rhythms and complex solos. But in the background, he also heard something else - a scream, followed by a loud crash a few blocks away. 

His super-hearing had alerted him to crime in progress. It was time for the city's guardian to emerge from the shadows. Jake leapt from his chair and opened his closet, revealing a hidden suit - red and blue spandex with a stylized "J" on the chest. In seconds he was changing, transforming into his alter ego, Justice Man.

Justice Man burst from the apartment and bounded up the fire escape to the roof, his super speed and strength propelling him higher and farther than any normal human. From the top of the building he listened again, filtering out the din of the city until he zeroed in on the source of the scream. An armored car robbery, three blocks east. He raced over rooftops, a blur of red and blue, arriving at the scene in under 30 seconds.

Three armed thieves were holding up the armored truck, weapons trained on the drivers. The thugs had already loaded bags of cash into their getaway van. Justice Man landed behind them with a thud, cracking the concrete under his feet. “Halt, evildoers! Your criminal plans end tonight!”

The robbers spun around, startled by the hero's sudden appearance. But their surprise turned to sneers. “Look boys, the freak in tights is here. Whatcha gonna do, little man, punch us?” They raised their weapons and opened fire.

Justice Man was faster, snatching the bullets out of the air before they could touch him. His hands moved in a blur, plucking metal slugs from the air like flowers as he calmly strode toward the thieves. After a few seconds of firing in vain, the robbers began to panic. Justice Man bent their guns one by one with his bare hands, leaving the weapons twisted and useless.  

In the distance, approaching sirens indicated the police were on their way. “I'd advise you gentlemen to lie face down on the ground with your hands on your heads. The authorities will take it from here.” The thieves hastily complied, flopping down belly first onto the pavement, realizing their luck had run out.

Justice Man smiled, his work done for the evening. “Another victory for justice. Now, back to the sweet sounds of Miles, my friends. The city can sleep well again tonight.” He rocketed up into the night sky, racing back to his tiny apartment and the hip world of jazz that kept everything else in balance.
