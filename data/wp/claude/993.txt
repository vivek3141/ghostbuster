The mist rolled down from the hills into the valley as the sun dipped below the horizon. Jane pulled her scarf tighter around her neck as a chill set in. She had gone for a hike to escape her worries for a few hours, but now she was miles from home, her visibility was dropping, and she was losing her way on the winding forest path. 

A sound caught her attention, a rustling in the underbrush. She froze in place, listening. It was probably just a bird or small animal, but her mind conjured up possibilities of bears or mountain lions in the woods. Her heart raced. More rustling, and then a rabbit emerged from the mist, not ten feet in front of her. It stopped, nose twitching, stood up on its hind legs, then bounced over to a patch of clover by the side of the path.

Jane let out the breath she had been holding. Just a rabbit. She felt silly for being spooked. Still, she was lost, and needed to find the main trail again before darkness fell completely. The rabbit nibbled at the clover, without a care, enjoying its evening meal. Jane took a step towards the rabbit, who perked up its ears but did not flee. 

"Well, little friend, I seem to have lost my way. I don't suppose you know the direction of the main trail, do you?" 

The rabbit did not respond, but shook its fur and went back to eating. Jane sighed. The mist was thickening and she was talking to wildlife. This hike had been a mistake. She took a few steps in one direction, then the other, but with visibility so low she couldn't spot any familiar landmarks. Fear started building in her chest.

Just then, the rabbit hopped over to her side of the path. It stopped and turned, looking over its shoulder at her. Then it hopped a few feet further down the path, stopped and turned again. 

"Do you...want me to follow you?" Jane asked incredulously. The rabbit shook itself again and hopped on, stopping periodically to check that she was keeping up. She stumbled along behind the rabbit for several minutes as night fell and darkness enveloped the forest. Just as panic started to rise in her chest, she spotted the glow of the parking lot lights through the trees. 

The rabbit led Jane all the way to the main trail, then disappeared into the brush without a sound. She breathed a sigh of relief at finding her way back to civilization. Her hike in the hills had taken an unexpected turn, a surreal experience she would not soon forget. A smile crossed her face as she realized her unlikeliest of guides: a rabbit in the mist.
