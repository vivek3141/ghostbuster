The old clock tower chimed midnight.

 Margaret sighed as she looked at the pile of ungraded papers on her desk. At this rate, she wouldn't be leaving the schoolhouse until dawn. She lit another candle and continued working.

 A few hours later, she finally finished. As she was packing up her things, she heard a strange noise coming from above. It sounded like moaning or creaking. Margaret froze in place, listening intently. There it was again. It seemed to be coming from the clock tower overhead. 

 Her heart racing, Margaret grabbed the heaviest book she could find and slowly made her way up the narrow staircase of the tower. The sounds grew louder with each step. 

 At the top, she peeked into the large room that housed the old tower clock. In the pale moonlight filtering through the windows, she saw two figures. But something wasn't right. They weren't facing each other—they had their backs to each other. And their movements were jerky and unnatural.

 As Margaret's eyes adjusted, she gasped. The figures had no faces. They were just cloth and stuffing—two old scarecrow figures that had somehow become animated. Her mind reeled as she watched the scarecrows twirl and cavort with each other in a grotesque dance. 

 Just then, the old clock struck the half hour, the booming chimes echoing in the chamber. At the sound, the two scarecrows froze in place. Their heads swiveled in unison toward the source of the sound, the old clock.

 Margaret didn't wait to see any more. She turned and fled down the stairs as fast as she could. She ran all the way into the village and pounded on the sheriff's door. By the time he and two deputies searched the old clock tower, the scarecrows had disappeared. But Margaret knew the truth. And she knew the old clock tower chimed midnight for a reason.
