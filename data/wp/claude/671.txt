The flames licked at John's blistered skin as he lugged heavy bags of sulfur up the jagged obsidian slopes of the volcano. His lungs burned with every acrid breath of the sulfurous air. But after 25 years in this eternal hellscape, his pain had become as familiar as an old friend. 

Each day blended into the next, an unending loop of torment and anguish. John had long given up hope of escaping his punishment. The devil himself had thrown John into this pit, condemned for a crime he did not commit. 

As John trudged up the volcano yet again, something caught his eye. A door, marked simply as "Exit". His heart raced. In 25 years of grinding toil, he had never seen anything like it. A way out? Impossible. Some cruel trick or illusion, no doubt.

He approached the door, his steps hesitant but quickening. It looked real. He ran his hands over the surface, feeling the grain of the wood, the hardness of the metal handle. His breath caught in his throat. Real. 

With a trembling hand, John grasped the handle and pulled. The door opened with a creak, revealing a cool green meadow under a soft blue sky. John blinked, blinded for a moment by the sunlight he had not seen in decades. 

He stumbled out of the door in shock and disbelief. Lush grass cushioned his feet, instead of sharp volcanic rock. Fresh, clean air filled his lungs. Flowers waved in a gentle breeze. John fell to his knees, overcome. He was out. Out of that hell, free at last. 

"Do you like my little gift?" purred a voice behind him. John whipped around to see the devil himself, lounging on the meadow grass, a sly grin on his red face. 

John's heart sank. Of course. It had been too good to be true. "What trickery is this now, devil?" he spat. "Come to torment me with a vision of freedom before dragging me back to my eternal damnation?"

The devil chuckled. "Nothing of the sort. I have decided to show you mercy, John. I am releasing you from your sentence."

John gaped at him. "Why?" he choked out. "After all these years of inflicted misery?" 

The devil sighed. "Because I'm tired, John. Tired of the same torments and the same screams echoing for eternity. You bore me now. And my mood is fickle. So go, you are free. Enjoy the rest of your mortal life. You will find I am not so easily bored twice."

With a wink, the devil vanished in a cloud of red smoke and laughter. John was left alone in the beautiful meadow, freedom his at last, bestowed by the caprice of the cruelest tormentor of all. But he did not dwell long on the irony. He had lost much, but now his life was his again. And John smiled, breathed deep of the sweet air, and walked on into the sunlight.
