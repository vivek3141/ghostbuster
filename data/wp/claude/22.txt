The grungy sponge sat in the bottom of the sink, soaked in a pool of cold, dirty water. Its once bright yellow exterior had turned a murky brown, stained with the remnants of meals past. As I grabbed its slimy, gritty surface, bits of food debris floated to the top of the water—flake of dried rice, a fragment of noodle, an unidentifiable greasy blob of something that may have once been cheese. 

Lifting the sponge brought with it a waft of rancid stench, as though a creature had crawled inside the damp, fetid cavern within and died. I gagged, the smell of mold and spoiled leftovers assaulting my senses. Gripping the sponge felt like clutching a piece of soggy, decaying flesh, all squishy lumps and tears.

As I squeezed the excess water from its pores, a stream of brownish sludge dripped out onto the counter. Bits of color and texture that shouldn’t exist oozed between my fingers. My stomach churned with revulsion at the thought of this bloated chunk of bacteria and filth that dared call itself a sponge. I couldn’t bring myself to touch its grossly engorged, almost obscene form for a second longer. With disgust, I flung it into the trash, hoping to purge from my memory the image of that nasty, nauseating thing that had been festering in my sink for far too long.
