The Relentless Advance

The poles were humanity's last refuge. After decades of warnings ignored, the worst predictions of global warming came to pass. The equatorial regions became uninhabitable, scorched into deserts by the unrelenting sun. Sea levels rose and swallowed coastal cities and islands. Billions perished in the Water Wars and Climate Riots. 

Those who survived fled north and south, to Greenland and Antarctica. Enormous climate-controlled domed cities were constructed to shelter the remnants of humanity. For a while, life found a rhythm in this harsh new world. People acclimated to life at the edge of viability, finding a grim comfort in the company of fellow survivors.

Research outposts were established at the abandoned equator to monitor the planetary changes. At first, the reports were more of the same: rising temperatures, barren wastelands, no signs of life. 

Then the reports became...strange. Unusual energy readings. Indications of biological activity. Scientists said instrumentation glitches must be at fault, yet a nagging doubt took hold in the domed cities. 

Reconnaissance flights were dispatched to survey the equatorial regions. They found something terrifying yet undeniable: life was proliferating at the equator. No human life, but something vast and connected and purposeful. An immense web of cracks and fissures on the earth, from which bubbled a foul reddish substance. Biological matter of some kind was seeding itself and spreading.

Panicked emergency meetings were convened in the capitals of the Arctic and Antarctica. This unknown lifeform was advancing steadily north and south, unchecked by the extreme conditions that had nearly wiped out humanity. Estimates showed if left unimpeded, this life would overrun the domed cities in months. 

A controversial decision was made: deploy nuclear weapons to halt the advance and eradicate the threat. Intercontinental ballistic missiles streaked north and south, detonating along the circumference of the planet like a fiery pearl necklace. For a brief moment, it seemed the plan had worked. The spread of the cracks and fissures stalled.

But soon frantic reports came in from monitoring stations: the lifeforms were mutating, adapting, and beginning to advance again at an accelerated rate. Mankind had sacrificed too much already; nuclear weapons were off the table due to the risk of impacting the domes. Conventional weapons proved useless. This menace seemed part biological, part machine, programmed to conquer and consume. 

The final transmission from an equatorial outpost showed a nightmarish scene: an ocean of churning red and black matter, dotted as far as the eye could see with the wrecks of weapons that had been futilely deployed to stop the onslaught. Then the transmission cut out, leaving only silence and static.

There would be no escape this time. The fate of humanity rested on the slim chance that something in the last habitable places on Earth might provide shelter if all else was lost. The creatures that had emerged from a warming world to claim the equator were life, but not as humanity knew it. Remade by devastation, they were the inheritors of the new planet, and they would not be denied their birthright. The age of mankind was coming to an end in ice and fire and a remorseless alien life form that advanced steadily north and south under a blazing sun that had once given sustenance but now signaled only doom.
