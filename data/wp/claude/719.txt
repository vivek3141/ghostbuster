The Detection 

The scientists at SETI could hardly believe it when the radio telescopes first picked up the signal. It was clearly artificial, emanating from a cluster of small craft heading into our solar system. Within hours, observatories around the globe confirmed visual sightings of a dozen small vessels moving at tremendous speed.

There was an uproar in the media and government circles. First contact! Undeniable proof that we were not alone. A dozen alien spaceships were entering our solar system, ignoring all hails and messages as they headed straight for...Saturn?

The ships took up an orbit around the ringed planet. Silent. Unmoving. They remained there for weeks, running scans and experiments, apparently oblivious to the frantic attempts at communication from Earth. Eventually interest waned and life returned to normal as the realization set in—they were ignoring humanity. 

Three years later, powerful sensors detected explosions near Saturn as a fleet of larger alien warships dropped out of warpspace and fired on the small craft, obliterating them without warning. Then they too left without a trace. The mysterious massacre shook the world. What had brought these violent newcomers to our neighborhood? And what interest did they have in destroying the peaceful first visitors? It was a tense and uncertain time.

A decade passed. Long enough for a new generation to grow up knowing in its bones that humanity was but a small, unimportant part of a universe that cared little for the fate of Earth. Just as that fate seemed to matter less and less, the aliens returned.

This time in greater numbers. Two full fleets, each easily outgunning the combined military forces of Earth, dropped into orbit at opposite ends of the solar system. It was a standoff that lasted for months. The aliens conducted operations on asteroids, moons and planets, only occasionally skirmishing with each other, but never fully engaging. They seemed evenly matched, and for reasons unknown had brought their conflict here.

Panic spread as nations realized how helpless they were. There were no demands or communications from the aliens. Humanity's fate seemed tied to the outcome of an extraterrestrial battle in our own backyard, but we had no ability to influence it. All we could do was listen in terror as the ominous sounds of warfare occasionally echoed through space—and pray our insignificant world didn't end up as collateral damage.
