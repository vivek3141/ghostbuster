The old warehouse lurked at the end of the abandoned street, holding untold secrets behind its rusty metal door. Jill walked past it every day on her way to school, the crumbling brick exterior like an old familiar face. But today something felt different. 

The massive padlock that usually secured the door hung open. As Jill walked by, a loud CRASH came from inside, followed by a scraping sound. Her heart raced. Should she call the police? But her curiosity got the better of her. She slowly crept up to the open door and peered inside.

Dim light filtered in through grimy windows. As her eyes adjusted, she gasped. A robot, at least 7 feet tall with arms like tree trunks, was smashing a hole in the concrete floor. But it wasnâ€™t alone. Two men wearing welding masks watched over the robot, directing its movements.

The robot suddenly stopped and turned, as if scanning the room. For a second, Jill feared its red glowing eyes made contact with hers, even in the shadows of the doorway. She ducked out of sight, heart pounding in her chest.

Footsteps echoed from inside, coming closer. The men were approaching the door. In a panic, Jill scrambled away from the warehouse as fast as she could, rounding the corner just as she heard the massive door creak open behind her.

Out of breath, Jill stopped and leaned against the wall of the nearest building. Robot? What were they building in there?  She shook her head in disbelief at what she had witnessed. She knew she had to tell someone. But who would believe a story about a giant robot and mysterious welders in an abandoned warehouse? Maybe it was better left untold, an unsolved mystery in an old familiar place.
