The bell rang signaling the end of English class. Mrs. Thompson gathered her things but suddenly stopped. She looked around with a confused expression. 

"I'll be right back class. Talk quietly among yourselves." She left the room in a hurry.

The class erupted in conversation, everyone relieved for an unexpected break. A few minutes passed and Mrs. Thompson didn't return. 

Jenny frowned. Mrs. Thompson was punctual and wouldn't leave them unsupervised for long. She raised her hand. "Should someone go look for Mrs. Thompson?"

"I'm sure she's fine," said Mark. "Enjoy the free time!"

A few more minutes passed. The chatter in the room grew louder. Jenny started to feel unsettled. She walked up to Mark who was laughing with his friends. 

"I'm going to go find Mrs. Thompson."

Mark shrugged. "Whatever."

Jenny left the room and walked down the empty hallway. All the other classrooms were silent. 

"Mrs. Thompson?" she called out. No answer. 

She turned a corner and saw a couple other students in the hall. They looked just as confused. 

"Have you seen any teachers?" asked a girl.

"No, have you?" replied Jenny. They shook their heads, alarm growing on their faces.

Jenny tried opening a few classroom doors but they were locked. She banged on the doors but no teacher came. 

They quickly walked to the main office but it was empty. Jenny tried the PA system but it didn't work. She picked up the phone but there was no dial tone.

Jenny's chest tightened. Where did everyone go? She returned to her English class.

"Guys, I can't find any teachers. The office is empty. The phones aren't working."

Silence fell in the room. Mark's expression changed. "Are you serious?"

Jenny nodded gravely. Whispers of alarm spread. A boy tried the classroom door and confirmed it was locked.

Mark stood on a desk. "Everyone remain calm! It appears the teachers have left for some reason. But I'm sure the authorities will realize soon and come help us. For now we'll keep order in here until we have more information."

The students looked at each other in a mix of confusion, fear, and a tinge of excitement at the prospect of no teachers or rules, at least for a little while. But unease over the mystery at hand lingered for what was in store...
