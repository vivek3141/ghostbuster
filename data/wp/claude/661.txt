Harry's heart sank as the sorting hat bellowed "Slytherin!" He froze in place, unsure of what to do next. This couldn't be right. He was meant to be in Gryffindor like his parents, not in the house of the cunning and ambitious. 

The Slytherin table erupted into cheers as the hat was lifted off Harry's head. He looked out and saw Draco Malfoy smirking at him, clearly delighted with this turn of events. Harry caught Hagrid's eye who gave him a small shrug and clapped with the others. 

Harry walked slowly to the Slytherin table where students were reaching out to pat him on the back. He sat down next to a boy with a prefect badge who said "Welcome Potter, we've been expecting you."

The sorting ceremony continued but Harry didn't pay attention, his mind racing. How did this happen? He had thought of nothing but Gryffindor the whole time the hat was on his head. Did the hat make some kind of mistake?

Harry looked up at the staff table where Dumbledore met his gaze. Dumbledore gave him a knowing look and nodded, his eyes twinkling. In that moment, Harry realized this was not an error. For some reason, the hat and Dumbledore wanted him in Slytherin. 

His housemates were celebrating around him but Harry sat in stunned silence. This was not how things were supposed to be. But as he looked out at the sea of green and silver, a small part of him wondered if the hat had known something about him that he didn't know yet. This was going to be an interesting first day of school.
