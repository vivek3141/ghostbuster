The documents were a bombshell. 11.5 million leaked files from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca revealed secret shell companies and offshore accounts of politicians, celebrities, and business elites from around the world. 

When the news first broke, Bruce Wayne didn't pay much attention. As a billionaire playboy, his name frequently appeared in gossip and tabloids. He assumed this would just be another story that quickly faded from the news cycle. But a few days later, his lawyer Lucius Fox called with an urgent message: "Bruce, we have a problem. Your name is listed in the Panama Papers."

Bruce's heart sank. He had always been careful to keep his illicit funding of Batman's vigilantism hidden behind layers of shell companies and diversions. But if there was a leak that penetrated one of his covert networks, his secret identity could be at risk.

Bruce rushed into the Batcave below the manor and pulled up the leaked documents on his massive computer display. There, scattered across thousands of pages of financial records, were links between holding companies that ultimately led back to Wayne Enterprises. To the ordinary eye, the trail was too obscure to follow. But Bruce saw how the connections could be made. His identity as the funder of Batman's tech and gear could be uncovered by determined journalists or FBI investigators.  

Over the following weeks, Bruce worked frantically with Lucius to obfuscate the network of shell companies even further. But ultimately, there were too many loose ends, too many payments and transfers that could potentially be traced back to Bruce Wayne's coffers. Despite their best efforts at damage control, the leak had already spread too far.

The call came late one night from Police Commissioner Gordon. "Bruce, I'm afraid your secret is out. The FBI just confronted me with irrefutable evidence that ties Batman's funding back to Wayne Enterprises. You've been outed as Batman's silent partner and benefactor."

Bruce sat in stunned silence. His worst fear had come to pass. Bruce Wayne could no longer operate in the shadows, funding Batman's war on crime in secret. Everything was about to change. Bruce took a deep breath and steadied his voice. "Jim, thank you for the heads up. It seems my work as Gotham's silent protector has now become very public."  

 "Any chance you've got a statement for the press?" Gordon asked grimly.  

Bruce sighed. "Yes, tell them...tell them 'No comment' -- for now. But that Batman will continue to serve and protect the citizens of Gotham, despite the recent revelations about who holds the purse strings."

Bruce slumped back into the leather chair of the Batcave and gazed at the familiar stalactite formations above. His secret was out. But in that moment, he realized the truth that really mattered: Batman's mission was bigger than any one man. As long as Gotham City still needed the Dark Knight, Bruce Wayne would find a way to answer the call.
