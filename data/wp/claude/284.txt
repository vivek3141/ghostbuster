The meeting dragged on as John tapped his pen on the conference table. After 15 centuries, little surprised him anymore.  Yet the petty mundanities of office life still grated.

As a junior paper pusher at Amalgamated Enterprises, John's long view gave him a patience his colleagues lacked. But  sometimes memories from distant times seeped in. The Black Death, the rise and fall of empires, wars and wonders - all passed through his mind during especially dull meetings.

In his early immortal days, John struggled coming to terms with timelessness and loss. Loved ones aged and died as he stayed unchanged. He tried vainly finding meaning and purpose, exploring the world's beauty and diversity.

Now John lived a life of anonymity and isolation. It was easier that way. No connections meant no pain when those connections ended. His life held little meaning beyond the daily routines of work to fill endless empty hours.

The meeting adjourned with the usual arguments and tensions unresolved. As John filed out, a young colleague asked with a smile, “So, any plans for the weekend?” 

John returned the smile. “The usual,” he replied. A nothingness of time stretched endlessly before him once more. His colleague would never know how loaded that simple question was, how it underscored the absurd tragedy of John's pointless immortality.  

After 1,000 years, John still searched for meaning. And feared he might spend 10,000 more years doing the same. An immortal life held little purpose without someone to share it with. But that was a pain too sharp to dwell on, even after all this time.
