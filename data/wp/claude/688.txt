My apologies, I have something to share, 
A curse has befallen me, beyond my control or care.
For each question or statement, a rhyming reply I must give,
This strange hex upon me, as long as I live.

I woke up this morning, my voice not quite my own,
Each word that I utter, in rhyme it is shown.
I know this will cause you, frustration and strife,
As I struggle to answer, while rhyming is rife.

My thoughts may be scattered, my meanings unclear,
Through rhyming responses, is all you will hear.
I beg your forgiveness, this was not my intent,
A mischievous magic, is what this has meant.

There's no way of knowing, how long this will last,
If days, weeks or longer, will this rhyming spell cast.
I pray you'll be patient, as we work side by side,  
Through questions and meetings, where my rhymes will abide.  

My answers may falter, not make sense at times,
As rhyming on demand, distorts thoughts into chimes.
But know I'm still present, though bound by this curse,  
We'll solve any problems, even if talks end in verse.

Forgive my rhyme ramblings, during this plight,
We will conquer this curse, and return speech to right.  
But for now lines in meter, is all I can say,  
As cursed to rhyme endlessly, come what may.
