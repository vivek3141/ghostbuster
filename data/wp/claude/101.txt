The guardian angel was thoroughly surprised when a demon mauled the assailant.  

Jophiel had been guarding the human woman, Amanda, for her entire life. As her guardian angel, it was his duty to watch over her and keep her safe from harm. For the most part, it had been an easy job. Amanda lived a quiet, uneventful life. She worked at the local library, had a few close friends, and rarely ventured into dangerous situations. 

That night had seemed no different. Jophiel watched as Amanda closed up the library and walked to her car in the deserted parking lot. But as she fumbled in her purse for keys, a man emerged from the shadows. He was unsteady on his feet, clearly intoxicated, but that only made his menacing advance more unpredictable. Amanda turned just in time to see the glint of a knife in the dim light. She froze in fear.

Jophiel acted instantly. He sent a burst of courage and confidence to Amanda, while also clouding the assailant’s mind and judgment. But the man continued to lurch forward, knife in hand. Jophiel spread his wings and dove, placing himself firmly between Amanda and her attacker. No mortal weapon could harm an angel, and Jophiel pushed the man back with a flap of his powerful wings.

Yet the assailant did not retreat. His eyes grew dark, his face twisting in a sinister grimace. This was no longer a mere drunkard - something unnatural and evil was now in control. The man swatted away Jophiel’s wings like they were feathers. Before Jophiel could react, a vice-like grip clenched around his throat, lifting him off the ground. 

Jophiel choked, grasping uselessly at the hand that held him. He was an immortal guardian, never meant for physical combat, powerless in the face of such raw evil strength. Darkness crept into the edges of his vision as he struggled in vain.

Suddenly, the hand released him. Jophiel dropped to the ground, his breath returning in ragged gasps. The assailant was preoccupied, writhing in a whirlwind of fire that raged but did not consume. An ominous, familiar figure stood at its center, features obscured by the inferno. It was one of the Fallen, a demon, intervening for reasons unknown.

The demon gestured, and the assailant went limp. The fire disappeared, leaving no trace of the roaring flames behind. The Fallen creature scooped up the unconscious man and turned to leave. 

Jophiel stepped forward, his wings flaring outward. “Why did you help us, abomination?”   

The demon glanced back, eyes gleaming. “Not for your sake, angel. The human woman has a part yet to play, and I would not see it end here at the hands of this worm.”

With that, demon and assailant vanished into smoke and ash, leaving the pungent smell of sulfur in their wake. Amanda still stood unharmed, staring in shock at the empty space where her attacker had been.

Jophiel folded his wings and gazed up at the night sky, searching for solace from his grace. Saving a human life was his purpose and duty. But owing that life to the whims of a demon left a bitterness that would not soon fade. The age-old battle of good versus evil was never straightforward, the lines between the two often blurred. On this night, Jophiel had caught a glimpse of just how complicated that struggle could be. His thoughts troubled, Jophiel turned back to continue his faithful watch over Amanda. There were questions here without answers, a mystery whose meaning remained veiled in the shadows.
