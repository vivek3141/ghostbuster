I woke with a start, confused for a moment about where I was. The amber glow of the sunrise filtered through the blinds, coloring the familiar room in strange shadows. As I blinked away the last remnants of sleep, a sense of displacement washed over me. Something felt off, though looking around nothing seemed out of place. 

My phone buzzed on the nightstand, reminding me of my early meeting. I sighed, annoyed at having overslept when I had so much to get done. Swinging my legs off the bed, my feet hit the cool wooden floor. In that moment a strange thought struck me—had the floor always been made of wood? I could have sworn it had been carpeted. 

Shaking off the bizarre feeling, I shuffled to the bathroom to splash some water on my face. The person staring back at me in the mirror was at once familiar and strange. I knew every curve and angle of that face, every laughter line and worry crease. Yet peering into my own eyes, an eerie feeling crept over me that years had passed since I last gazed into that mirror. Years full of events I had no memory of.

Chalking it up to lack of caffeine, I pushed the strange sensations aside and rushed through my morning routine. A quick breakfast, a faster commute, and before I knew it I was striding through the doors of the office. My assistant greeted me with a friendly smile and a steaming cup of coffee. As I thanked her, a flicker of confusion crossed her face. “Long time no see,” she said slowly. “Everything alright?”

Her puzzlement only added to my own. Nothing seemed outwardly amiss, yet a growing panic was bubbling up inside me. Casually questioning other coworkers yielded similar confused and concerned reactions. According to them, I hadn’t shown up or contacted anyone for weeks. An emergency client meeting had to be abruptly rescheduled because I was nowhere to be found.  But in my mind, I had just seen them all the day before.

Retreating to my office, I tried to slow my racing pulse. There had to be a rational explanation. Stress or exhaustion or some kind of temporary amnesia. Yet a dark fear was taking hold in the pit of my stomach. What if some unknown event had fractured my reality and sent part of me tumbling through the cracks?

The thought was implausible yet refused to be ignored. I knew with sudden certainty that while the world turned, time had broken and left me behind. The familiar office and coworkers were but remnants of a life I had already lived. I was trapped in a past that was no longer my own. Adrift and anchorless, I struggled in vain to find my footing as the world around me struggled to catch up. The chasm stretched endlessly before me. I sighed, rested my head on the cool wooden desk, and let the feeling of being lost in time wash over me.
