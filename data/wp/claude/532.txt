Brittany flipped her long blonde ponytail over her shoulder as she walked down the dimly lit hallway of the abandoned mental asylum. Her cheerleading skirt swished around her thighs and her bright blue eyes darted around nervously. She knew wandering into creepy places at night was a terrible idea, yet here she was. All because her stupid jock of a boyfriend, Brady, had dared her. He knew she could never back down from a challenge. 

As Brittany walked deeper into the bowels of the building, strange noises started to echo around her. Drips, scratches, groans. Her pace quickened as panic started to set in. What was I thinking? She thought. I’m a stereotypical dumb blonde in a horror movie. I’m going to die!

Just as the thought crossed her mind, Brittany spotted a shadow move at the end of the hallway. She froze in place, her blood running cold. This was it. The masked killer was here to slash her to bits like a mindless bimbo. 

Then Brittany remembered she wasn’t just some airhead. She was at the top of her class, captain of the debate team, and had already been accepted into Harvard law school. She refused to die like some clueless slasher film victim. She was going to get out of here using her intelligence.   

The shadow emerged from the darkness, and to Brittany’s relief it was only a stray cat, not a machete-wielding maniac. Her panic subsided, replaced by anger at herself for the stereotypical assumptions she had made. She turned on her heel and marched out of the building, no longer fearful of the noises around her.

When she emerged outside, Brady and the other football players were laughing and drinking beer in the parking lot. “We thought you'd be in there screaming all night!” Brady guffawed.  

Brittany strode up to him and grabbed the beer out of his hands. "I went in there and realized something. I'm not just some dumb cheerleader you can manipulate. I'm smarter than all of you put together. Consider yourself dumped!" 

She tossed the can into the garbage and walked to her Prius, head held high. She had refused to become a horror movie victim and had reclaimed her identity as an intelligent, independent woman. And she was going to Harvard, whether Brady liked it or not!
