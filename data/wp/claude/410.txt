The Storm

The sea churned and crashed against the rocks as the storm intensified. I pulled my cloak tighter and trudged up the narrow path to the old lighthouse, hoping the keeper would take pity on a weary traveler. 

The lighthouse keeper was known as a recluse, avoiding all unnecessary contact with people. But night was falling and the trail back down too treacherous in this weather. I had no choice but seek temporary refuge or risk being caught in the open.

I pounded on the sturdy wooden door, praying he would open up. After a few minutes of knocking, I heard the lock mechanism groan and the door slowly creaked open. The old man glared at me, annoyance etched into the deep lines of his face. I opened my mouth to explain but he shook his head and motioned me in with a gruff sweep of his arm.

We sat in silence as he stoked the fire in the small cotttage, the howling wind rattling the windows. He offered me a bowl of fish stew, avoiding eye contact. His clear desire for solitude hung in the air between us, yet I was grateful to be out of danger for the night.

At dawn, the storm had passed. Without a word, the old lighthouse keeper unlocked the door. I stepped outside and turned to thank him. He simply nodded in reply, but for the briefest moment I thought I glimpsed a hint of shared understanding in his eyes. His duty to provide safe harbor during a storm transcended even his deepest wish for solitude.  I made my way down to the village below, grateful for the silent compassion of the old keeper and vowing to respect the simple gifts of shelter in times of need.
