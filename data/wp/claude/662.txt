The note lay on the passenger seat of the old Chevy, two short sentences scratched in capital letters on a sheet of crumpled paper:

THERE'S A SHOTGUN IN THE TRUNK. TAKE IT, AND FIND HIM. 

Jake stared at the note for a long minute, reading the words over and over. His heart thudded in his chest. He knew exactly who had left the note, and what it meant. 

With shaking hands, Jake popped the trunk of the Chevy. Sure enough, there was a pump action shotgun lying on top of the spare tire. Jake took a deep breath and lifted it out, feeling the heft of the weapon in his hands. He hadn’t held a gun since his days in the army, and he felt both familiarity and fear as his fingers curled around the grip.

Flashes of memory burst in his mind like fireworks. The jungles of Vietnam. The shouting of soldiers. The sounds of gunfire and the acrid smell of smoke. And him - the traitor who had betrayed Jake’s unit, leading them into an ambush. The only person who had escaped that day, disappearing like a ghost.

Until now. Jake slammed the trunk shut with trembling rage. The traitor had finally surfaced, and it was time for revenge. 

Jake got in behind the wheel of the Chevy, thinking of his men who had died that day in the jungle. Thinking of the years he had spent blaming himself, haunted by guilt and anger. His heart pounding in his ears, Jake started the engine and turned the Chevy onto the road leading out of town and into the mountains. He knew exactly where the traitor was heading. There was an old hunting cabin up there, secreted away. It would be the perfect place for him to hide.

The Chevy’s tires squealed as Jake accelerated up the winding road. His hands were sweaty on the wheel, the shotgun on the seat beside him. Anticipation sent adrenaline coursing through his veins. By the time he turned off the main road, approaching the hidden drive that led to the cabin, his breath was coming hard and fast. 

In the distance through the windshield, Jake could see a thin ribbon of smoke, rising up from the chimney of the old cabin. He was there. The time for revenge and justice had finally come. Jake clenched his jaw, gripped the shotgun, and aimed the Chevy up the dirt road like a bullet.
