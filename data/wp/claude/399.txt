The old man lay on the table, wheezing softly. His lungs had finally given out after 97 years of life. As I looked down at him, I knew what I had to do. What I always did. My name was Clara, and I was a doctor in this age of efficiency. 

My assistant chimed in, "Administering euthanasia injection in 3...2..."

"Stop," I said. The word came out before I could think about it. My assistant blinked in confusion. "We're going to try to save this man instead."

"Doctor, that goes against protocol. We have a duty to prevent suffering and conserve resources."

I looked down at the man again. His eyes met mine, pleading and fearful. I saw my reflection in his gaze and felt a deep sense of wrongness at what I had been doing for years. "You're right. But we also have a duty to heal. And I became a doctor to save lives, not end them." 

My assistant was silent, caught in a logic loop. I turned my attention to the oxygen tanks, upping the flow rate to maximum. The man's breathing eased slightly. I rushed to the medicine cabinets, grabbing lung regen treatments I had only vaguely studied. As I injected them, his eyelids fluttered closed and his chest rose higher.

Hours passed in a blur. At one point, his heart stopped and I nearly wept as I resuscitated him. My assistant stood by, a silent and conflicted watchman.
Finally, the man awoke. His smile lit up the room as he breathed easy for the first time in decades. "Thank you," he whispered.

News spread quickly. Families of patients started pleading for their lives to be saved. Some of my fellow doctors condemned me, while others felt inspired by rediscovering purpose. The debate raged on until the authorities stepped in.

I stood before a review board as they decided my fate. "Your actions go against the very foundations of our society," they said. "All people must pass when their suffering becomes too great. Your 'healing' will only spread chaos if allowed to continue."

"I became a doctor to save lives, not end them prematurely," I argued. "Killing should always be an absolute last resort." 

Their response was unmoved. "You are stripped of your medical license immediately. You will serve out your days in confinement, removed from the general population you seek to poison with your dangerous ideals."

As they led me away, I caught a glimpse of the old man. Our eyes met again, and though no words were said, his smile told me everything. His extended life was a light in the darkness, a small and fragile flame of hope. A hope that had nearly gone out, but now had the chance to spread. My years of confinement would be difficult,  but that memory--and the knowledge I had saved a life when all others would have extinguished it--would give me strength. For defying the darkness, I had found my purpose again. And that was worth any cost.
