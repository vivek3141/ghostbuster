The darkness felt comforting as I lay in bed, my eyes squeezed shut. The sounds of the city filtering through the cracks of my apartment were familiar and helped lull me to sleep. But tonight, sleep didn't come easy. 

My mind wandered to the events of the day, replaying scenes over and over. Walking through the crowded plaza during my lunch break, a bicyclist swerving at the last second to avoid hitting a pedestrian, a stack of papers sliding off a messenger's cart, scattering across the sidewalk. In each instance, everything around me slowed down, as if the world was moving in slow motion. I had time to notice details - beads of sweat on the bicyclist's forehead, a coffee stain on one page sliding across the concrete. I also felt a tingling, buzzing sensation, like a surge of energy was coursing through my veins.

And then, as quickly as it started, time sped back up. The world whizzed by at its usual pace. But I was left breathless, my heart pounding. These episodes had been happening more frequently. At first, I thought it was just a fluke, my mind playing tricks on me. But I couldn't ignore it anymore - something strange was going on. 

I was afraid to admit the truth, even just to myself. I squeezed my eyes shut tighter, trying in vain to push the thought away. Part of me wished the episodes would just stop. But another part of me felt a thrill at the strange sense of power and possibility.

My breath caught in my chest as I heard a loud crash in the alleyway below my window, the unmistakable sound of trash cans toppling over. I froze in place, listening. There were shuffling sounds, voices cursing, and then silence. 

I slowly got out of bed and peered out my window. In the dim yellow glow of the alley light, I saw two figures dressed in black rummaging through the knocked over trash cans, apparently looking for anything valuable or useful. 

There was another loud crash further down the alley as more trash cans fell. The figures froze for a second, then hurried down the alley towards the other sound.

My heart pounded as I watched them, torn between calling the police and handling the situation myself. I felt the now familiar buzz of energy coursing through me. The world slowed around me once again. 

I knew I couldn't avoid the truth any longer. I had a gift - a superpower. Time seemed to bend to my will. But with this gift came a cost - the fear of knowing I was different, of what I might be capable of, and of what others might do if they discovered what I could do. 

I took a deep breath, pulse racing. For now, I would remain in the shadows, this secret tightly under wraps. The figures continued down the alley and out of view, off to cause trouble elsewhere. The alley was silent and empty once again. I crawled back into bed, questions swirling in my mind. Eventually exhaustion took over and I drifted off to sleep, my secret still safe in the darkness of night.
