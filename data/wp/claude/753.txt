The apartment was quiet as I read my book, curled up on the sofa. John dozed on the other end of the couch, his breathing slow and steady. 

After a while I got up to make some tea. As the water boiled, I glanced over at John. He hadn't moved. I walked over and nudged him gently. "John?" No response. Panic started to rise in my chest. 

I shook him harder, shouting his name. Nothing. Frantically, I checked for a pulseâ€”it was there, slow but steady. He was alive, but wouldn't wake up.

My phone. I grabbed it and dialed 911, shouting for help as soon as the operator answered. The operator sounded confused. "Ma'am, I need you to calm down and speak clearly. What is the emergency?" 

I took a deep breath. "My boyfriend won't wake up. He's breathing but unresponsive. Please send help!" The operator assured me paramedics were on their way. I pleaded for her to stay on the line. She agreed, her voice becoming sleepy. In mid-sentence, I realized with dawning horror that she had fallen silent. 

The paramedics arrived quickly. As they examined John, one started to wobble. He caught himself, shaking his head to clear it, but soon slumped to the ground, fast asleep. The other paramedic stared in shock, then her eyes fluttered and she joined her partner on the floor.

I fled the apartment, bursting onto the street. But everywhere lay the sleeping forms of people going about their day just minutes before. The whole city had succumbed.

Alone, confused and frightened, I wandered the abandoned streets. Everyone I came across inevitably fell prey to the strange sleeping sickness, their lives put on hold in an endless slumber. I seemed to be the only one immune - and so I continue to walk, alone and afraid, through the endless silent nightmare my world has become. All around me the city sleeps, and I can do naught but watch and wait.
