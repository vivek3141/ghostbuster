The sun filtered through the blinds as John woke up. Just another mundane Monday, he thought. As he went through his morning routine, something felt off. His movements felt staged, like someone was controlling him. He shook off the strange feeling and headed to work.

On the drive in, John had the uncanny sense that his actions weren't his own. When he changed lanes or turned the steering wheel, it felt guided by some invisible hand. "This is ridiculous," he said out loud, hoping the sound of his own voice would snap him out of this funk. 

At the office, John's awkward, unsettling feeling intensified. His coworkers seemed to be characters in a story, their dialog and actions manufactured. When his boss walked by, John felt compelled to say, "Morning, sir," as if the words were being fed to him.

During his lunch break, John sat alone with his troubling thoughts. There was no logical explanation for how artificial and pre-destined the world felt today. In a moment of panic, a wild idea struck him: What if I'm not real? What if I'm a character in someone else's narrative?

The notion was insane, yet it resonated deeply. It seemed to explain the unshakable feeling of being guided against his will all day. John raced home, his existential crisis mounting. 

At home in his bedroom, John called out to the empty room, "Is anyone there?" No response came. Feeling foolish but desperate for answers, he asked, "Am I just a character in a story?"

John held his breath, part of him fearing a reply. The silence persisted. Deflated, he sat down on his bed. He must be losing his mind to even entertain these kinds of bizarre ideas. As he shook his head, a single word floated through his mind in a voice not his own:

Yes.

A chill ran down John's spine. His thoughts spiraled as the truth settled in. His world, his life, his identityâ€”all constructed. He was trapped in someone else's narrative. A story character discovered he wasn't real.
