Archie walked down the quiet street towards the Chok’lit Shoppe, hands in his pockets, lost in thought. Things had been complicated for a while now, torn as he was between the affections of Betty and Veronica. Sweet, kind-hearted Betty had been his neighbor and friend since childhood. Veronica was the dazzling newcomer, the wealthy heiress who stormed into Riverdale and turned his world upside down. 

He couldn’t keep going like this, constantly waffling between the two, unable to choose and commit to a future with either girl. The time had come to make a decision and stick to it. As he entered the Shoppe, the familiar smell of burgers and milkshakes wafted over him. He glanced at his usual booth, where Betty and Veronica were both sitting, chatting amiably. His heart swelled at the sight of them. How could he ever let one go?

Betty noticed him first and her face lit up with a smile. She waved eagerly, patting the seat next to her. Veronica turned and when she caught sight of Archie, her eyes gleamed and she gave him a coy smile. He walked over slowly, his legs heavy, and slid into the booth. 

There was an awkward silence. Both girls gazed at Archie expectantly. He took a deep breath. 

“I have something to say to both of you. You both mean the world to me, and I feel like the luckiest guy to have your affection and support.” Betty and Veronica glanced at each other, puzzled. 

Archie continued, “But the time has come for me to choose one of you to be my girl. I can’t go on hurting you both like this with my indecision.”

Betty and Veronica looked crestfallen. Neither wanted the other to be chosen. Archie’s throat tightened. This was so much harder than he anticipated.

“Veronica Lodge, you are the most vibrant, exciting girl I’ve ever known. My life will never be dull with you in it. You bring out a boldness in me I never knew I had.” 

Veronica’s eyes lit up and she reached for Archie’s hand. But he pulled away gently. 

“Betty Cooper, you are the kindest, most steadfast person in my life. With you by my side, I know that I can get through anything. You believe in me and always see the best in me.” 

Betty gasped, hardly daring to hope. Archie turned to her, eyes full of love and certainty. 

“Betty, will you be my girl?”

Betty threw her arms around Archie, overjoyed. He held her tight, filled with peace at his choice. Veronica slumped in her seat, devastated but resigned. Archie had followed his heart. His heart led him to Betty.
