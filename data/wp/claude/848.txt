The old tower loomed over the forest, crumbling yet still standing after centuries of neglect. The locals avoided it, wary of the dangers that lurked within. Rumors of strange lights, eerie noises, and travelers going missing had kept the superstitious villagers away for as long as anyone could remember. 

No one dared explore the tower, no one except the children. Tom and Jenny had been friends as long as they could remember, growing up together in the small village. They were curious about the world and hungry for adventure. The tower had always fascinated them, and they dreamed of discovering its secrets.

One autumn evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon and a harvest moon rose over the treetops, Jenny and Tom decided to venture into the tower. They packed supplies, grabbed a lantern, and headed into the overgrown forest path under the cover of twilight.

After battling thick brush and webs of ivy, they arrived at the tower. A massive oak door with rusted iron braces blocked the entrance. With all their might, they pried and pushed until it creaked open.

Their lantern revealed a spiral staircase leading up into darkness. Step by step, they climbed higher, hearts pounding in their chests. Cobwebs caught in their hair and dust swirled in the lantern light. 

At the top, they emerged into a large chamber. In the center stood a pedestal holding an ancient book. But more startling was the robed figure who turned to face them, a skeletal face peering out from under a deep hood.

They froze in terror, their lantern clattering to the floor. An inhuman voice echoed from the figure. “My, my. Visitors. How... delicious.” 

A bony hand emerged from the robes, pale fingers extending towards the children. They screamed, stumbling backwards and falling against the hard stone floor.

From the rafters above came a loud caw. A raven soared down, landing on the outstretched arm of the hooded figure. It cocked its head, gazing at the two intruders with beady black eyes.

The figure let out a raspy chuckle. “Don’t worry,” it said, stroking the raven’s feathers. “This is Edgar. He is quite fond of... company. He gets so lonely up here, don't you, my pet?”  

Jenny and Tom could only stare in stunned silence, trembling on the floor of the tower. The hooded figure gazed down at them. “You have nothing to fear. You see, nobody knew my humanity wasn't entirely gone. I have always longed for companionship. And I have always loved my dear Edgar.”

The tension slowly left their bodies as they gazed into the darkness of the hood. There, in the depths, they saw the familiar twinkle of a human soul behind the monster. The lich simply missed the light of friendship, trapped for an eternity within this crumbling place. 

Edgar cawed once more, turning his head to peer at the two children, judge and jury observing the unexpected visitors. 

The lich knelt down, skeletal hands still hidden within voluminous sleeves. But the voice that emerged seemed almost warm. “Will you stay, and keep an old lich and his raven company?”

Jenny and Tom looked at one another, clasping hands tightly. A smile crept across their faces as fear gave way to boldness. They had found an adventure greater than any they could have imagined. Their voices rang out as one:

“Yes!”
