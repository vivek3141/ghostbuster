The pale blue eyes of the villagers shifted and changed with every passing emotion—flashes of green amidst joy, hazel  when annoyed, gray when melancholy. All except for Nor's eyes. His eyes remained a fixed sapphire blue, untouched by the emotional tides that churned within him. 

Nor was different, strange. His immutable eyes unnerved the others. Eyes that never changed seemed cold, detached, inhuman. His family loved him but they also feared his difference. The other children teased and baited Nor, trying to trigger changes in his eyes that never came.

As Nor grew into a man, the mistrust deepened. His unwavering eyes made people uncomfortable. Was he really feeling anything at all behind that placid blue gaze? The village elders refused to promote him to a position of responsibility. “How can he empathize with people’s joys and sorrows when he shows nothing? He’s not one of us.”

Nor eventually fell in love with a kind woman named Sera, one of the few willing to look past the alienness of his unchanging eyes. They married and Sera gave birth to their first child. Nor's heart swelled with a joy and wonder beyond any he had known. He peered into the newborn's eyes, and for the first time in his life, Nor's own eyes shifted in color. His child’s eyes were a vibrant leafy green. Nor's eyes had turned emerald as well, a perfect reflection of the springtime hope and new beginnings he felt inside.

At last, Nor’s secret was revealed. His eyes were windows to emotion none could see. And in that moment, all the village rejoiced in welcoming Nor and embracing him as one of their own. For unchanging eyes perhaps hid depths deeper still.
