The cold wind swept through the empty streets of the village as Mary hurried home under the dim light of the oil lamps. Her father had not returned from the war and another harsh winter was settling upon their small farm. She worried constantly about how they would survive without father to help plow the fields and tend to the animals. 

As Mary entered the farmhouse, she found her mother bent over the fire, coughing violently. Her usually strong and hardy mother had been weakening over the past months, the constant worry and work wearing away at her health. 

"Mother, are you unwell?" asked Mary. Her mother attempted a smile but it quickly faded into another fit of coughing. 

"Just a small cold, nothing to worry about my dear," she said, her voice hoarse. But Mary saw the truth in her mother's eyes. This was no trifling illness.

Over the next few days, Mary nursed her mother as best she could, making her warm broths and herbal remedies. But her mother's condition only worsened. Her coughing grew harsher, her breathing more labored. Mary's worry intensified with each passing day. She knew they needed the village doctor but they could not afford his services or the medicines he would prescribe.

One night, Mary woke to the sounds of her mother gasping for air. She rushed to her side and was horrified to find her mother barely able to breathe, her lips tinged with blue. 

"Mother, I must fetch the doctor!" cried Mary. Her mother grasped her hand tightly and shook her head. Mary knew that meant there would be no chance of paying for the doctor's aid. Her mother was accepting her fate.

Hot tears spilled down Mary's cheeks as she stayed by her mother's side through the long hours of darkness. She held her hand, wiped her brow, and whispered prayers and words of love and comfort. Yet with the first light of dawn, her beloved mother took her last labored breath.

Mary was devastated. She wept bitterly over the loss of her constant companion and caretaker. Her father was still off at war and now she was alone struggling to manage the farm. She felt as if all hope had fled with her mother's passing.

A few days later, as Mary was digging a grave for her mother, she heard a familiar voice call her name. She turned to find her father limping up the road, using a stick to steady his steps. He had been released from duty due to injury and made haste to return home.

Upon learning of his wife's passing and seeing Mary's tear-stained face, he wrapped her in his loving embrace. Though they wept together at their loss, Mary felt his strong arms around her and hope blossomed once again in her heart. She was not alone - her father had returned. Tomorrow the sun would rise again.
