The darkened room was filled with smoke. Around the table sat the CEOs of the major oil companies, their faces illuminated by the glow of cigars and the projection on the screen.

"This technology could ruin us," said the ExxonMobil CEO. "If these solar panels hit the market, demand for oil will plummet." 

"We have to stop this," said the Shell executive. "But how?"

The BP CEO smiled grimly. "We have our methods." He entered a code into the keypad and a new display appeared, showing a traveling waveform. "We have detected signs of chronological manipulation. It appears environmentalists in the future have developed time travel and are sending agents back to seed new energy technologies today. We've been monitoring for these incursions for decades."

The Shell woman sucked in her breath. "Can we neutralize these agents?"  

"We have had some success with that approach," said the BP chief. "Accidents happen, after all. But better to control the technology itself. If we can access their time machines, we can go to the source in the future and stop them before they even send the agents back."

"Let's do it then!" said the ExxonMobil man, pounding his fist on the table. 

"It's not that simple," warned the BP executive. "Time travel is perilous and can have unforeseen consequences. But rest assured, we are working with the best minds to build our own chronological intervention division. We have had... setbacks, but we are making progress."

The executives all nodded in agreement. Protecting the oil industry was paramount, no matter the cost. If it meant sabotaging new energy technologies today or journeying to the future itself to clip the wings of environmental do-gooders before they even took flight, so be it. The free market demanded cheap oil, the politicians demanded corporate donations, and the public demanded gas for their SUVs. The future could take care of itselfâ€”and the BP division would make sure of that.
