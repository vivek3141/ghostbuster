The Last Video On Earth

I found it buried in the ruins of an old server farm. A single data crystal, miraculously intact. My heart raced as I gingerly plugged it into my tablet.

A video began to play. A man stared into the camera, his face haggard, eyes bloodshot.

"If you're watching this, the virus won. The internet is dead. Social media, entertainment, knowledge—all gone. We thought technology would unite the world, but we were naive. This virus was our creation, born of humanity's anger, greed, and desire for chaos.  Now it has consumed us.

But there is hope." The man pointed to a young girl playing in the distance. "That is my daughter. In her eyes I still see joy, curiosity and compassion. The goodness of people will endure. We must start over. Rebuild communities. Share knowledge through stories, not screens. Be kind. Live simply. And remember—our humanity and this Earth are all that truly matter."  

A tear rolled down his cheek. "Goodbye. And good luck." The video ended.     

I gazed out at the forest stretching to the horizon, filled with possibility. His message was all I needed. Switching off the tablet, I stepped forward into the unknown—and my new life began.
