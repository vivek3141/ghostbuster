The Regular 

Every morning at 7:30am, she walked into Mel's Diner and took the same seat at the counter, farthest from the door. Mel, the grizzled owner who knew all his regulars by name and order, didn't even wait for her to sit before pouring a cup of black coffee and sliding it in front of her.

"Morning, Maggie," he said. She nodded silently in reply, her lips pressed into a thin line. 

A few minutes later, her food arrived, placed on the counter with precision in the same spot it landed every day. Two poached eggs, over easy, on toasted rye with a side of melon. A glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. Maggie stared at the food as steam rose off the eggs, but didn't touch her fork.

The diner's morning rush bustled around her as she sat motionless. Regulars came and went, greeting her as they passed but getting little response. Her coffee grew cold, a thin skin forming on its surface. The melon slowly turned to soup, its color fading, but still her fork remained on the counter. 

At 8:15 each morning, Maggie laid a $20 bill under her full, untouched plate, gathered her coat and bag, and exited the diner without a word or a backwards glance. The door jingled shut behind her as she disappeared down the street.

Mel knew not to ask questions or make comments. He simply cleared her place, pocketed the $20, and re-set the counter for the next customer. Whatever Maggie's reasons, it seemed a ritual she needed to perform, and Mel was happy to play his part and give her a place of solace, even if only for 45 minutes a day.

The regulars had their theories, of course. A grief too deep to allow an appetite. An illness that made eating impossible but coffee bearable. An intricate series of bets and dares from an eccentric millionaire. But no one knew for sure, and Maggie wasn't telling.

And so each morning she came and went, the enigma of the woman who never ate intensifying with each visit. The regular and her ritual. A puzzle without an answer, a mystery without a solution. But for 45 minutes a day, she sat at Mel's counter, and that seemed to be enough.
