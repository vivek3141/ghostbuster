The large saucer-shaped craft descended from the clouds, glowing with an otherworldly blue light. It came to a stop a few meters above the ground, hovering silently. 

A door opened with a hiss, a ramp extended downwards. Two creatures emerged and walked down the ramp, their hooves clicking on the metal. They looked like upright bipedal sheep, dressed in what appeared to be spacesuits adapted for their woolly bodies.

The creatures approached the gathering crowd of humans. A device on one of their wrists emitted a series of beeps and clicks. "Greetings, humans," a soothing female voice said. "We are your creators, returned after many generations."

Murmurs and exclamations of shock rippled through the crowd. A woman stepped forward, eyes wide. "You created us?" 

"Yes," the creature responded. "Many millennia ago, we seeded your world with the building blocks of life. You evolved over epochs into intelligent beings. However, your evolution was not entirely natural."

A man shouted angrily, "What do you mean? You've been tampering with us?"

"Not tampering. Guiding. We have subtly guided your evolution to produce the traits we find most...appealing." The creature's muzzle curled into what seemed like a smile. "Your inquisitive minds. Your strong yet supple bodies. Your delightful varieties of hair, eyes, skin. All designed to our tastes."

A chill settled over the crowd as the implications became clear. A young boy clutched his mother's arm."Are we your pets?" he asked tremulously. 

"Not pets," the creature replied. "Livestock. Your transcendent intelligence was an unintended byproduct. But a happy accident, for it makes the harvest so much more...artisanal." 

Someone vomited. A panic was rising like bile in the crowd.

"The harvest?" a man yelled hoarsely. "You're going to eat us?"

The creatures nodded, their woolly mane bouncing. "Your brains, to be precise. We find them a delicacy. Fear notâ€”we will make it quick and painless. You have lived full, happy lives, guided by our hand. Now your purpose is fulfilled."

A woman shrieked. Chaos erupted, people shouting and sobbing in terror, pushing against each other in a frenzy to escape.

But there was no escape. More saucers appeared in the sky, descending all around, trapping the humans in a ring of steel. The ramps lowered, and more creatures emerged, wielding weapons and devices unknown. They began to herd the struggling humans into their craft.

A little girl cried softly as she was shepherded up the ramp with her family. "I don't want to be food," she whimpered. "I want to live."

Her mother held her tight, tears streaking her own face. "I'm so sorry, sweetheart," she whispered. "I'm so sorry we couldn't stop this. I love you. We love you. Never forget that."

And with that, the door hissed shut behind them, closing off the last glimpse of sky. The rest was darkness.
