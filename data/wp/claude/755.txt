The Grim Reaper sighed as he looked at the mounting pile of soul collection requests on his desk. He was exhausted. After centuries of tireless work, he needed a break. It was time for some well-deserved time off. 

But who could replace him while he was away? He couldn't just leave souls uncollected. He sat back in his chair, steepled his bony fingers, and thought.

There was only one solution. He needed to find a temp. He placed an ad in the supernatural classifieds and started interviewing candidates.

The first to appear was a skinny, pimply-faced teen wearing a black hoodie and holding a scythe. "I'm called the Dude of Doom," he said in a raspy voice, attempting bravado.  The Reaper stifled a sigh.  "Have you any experience collecting souls?" he asked.

"Well, no, dude, but like how hard can it be?" asked the teen with unearned confidence.

"This job requires precision, skill, and wisdom," replied the Reaper dismissively. "You are unqualified. Please see yourself out."

The next candidate was a party girl named Kali Ma in a short red dress clutching a margarita. "I thought this could be a fun side gig," she said with a giggle. "I could use the extra cash for my bar tab!"

The Reaper shook his head in disbelief.  "Soul collection is not 'fun' or glamorous. It is a serious responsibility which you clearly do not appreciate. Goodbye." 

As the Reaper was losing hope, a final visitor arrived. He sensed an unearthly chill as a tall, gaunt man glided in. His skin was pale as frost, his eyes black as coal. "I am Count Vladimir Drakov," he intoned in an icy Transylvanian accent.  "I have experience with matters of life and death." He bared pointy fangs in a sinister smile.

The Reaper sat up with interest. "You may be suitable," he mused. "But this is not about taking life, it is about ensuring the dead receive their eternal reward. Can you be entrusted with shepherding souls to the afterlife?"  

"Of course," Drakov replied smoothly. "I follow orders to the letter. Your rules will be my rules."  

The Reaper sensed Drakov might prove a worthy sustitute. "The job is yours for two weeks," he decreed. "Do not fail me."

Drakov's icy smile widened. "It will be my pleasure and privilege to serve." He gave a quick bow before gliding out as effortlessly as he had entered.

The Reaper felt the closest he could come to relief. At last, his burden would be lifted, if only briefly. He hoped he wouldn't end up regretting hiring a temp from Transylvania. But for now, he had a beach in the Bahamas calling his name. His scythe would remain in the closet, untouched, for the next blissful two weeks. It was time for a holiday at last. The Reaper happily tossed away his robes and headed out to catch some sun, content that souls were in good hands. Well, perhaps not good so much as extremely frozen. But efficient hands, all the same.
