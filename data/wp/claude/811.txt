The old warehouse lurked at the end of the abandoned street, holding untold secrets behind its rusty metal door. Jill walked past it every day on her way to school, daring herself to go inside. 

One day, Jill couldnâ€™t resist. She pried open the heavy door with all her might. "Hello?" No answer. She stepped inside. 

Dusty sunlight streamed through high windows, illuminating a figure under a tarp. Jill whipped off the tarp. A robot! Its metal surface was dented but shiny. It suddenly blinked its eyes open. 

"I am Unit 42-XJ7. Who has reactivated me?" it asked in a mechanical voice.

Jill gasped, stumbling backwards. The robot stretched its arms, joints creaking. "Do not be alarmed, human creature. I mean you no harm. I was built to serve. How may I assist you?"

Jill hesitated. A robot butler? Every kid's dream! "What's your name?" she asked.

"I have no name, only my model number." 

Jill smiled. "I'll call you 'Botty.' My name's Jill. I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship!" She shook the robot's metal hand, sealing their secret pact. Her boring walk to school would never be the same again with a robot friend by her side.
