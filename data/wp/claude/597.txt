The swear jars had popped up overnight, like mushrooms after heavy rain. Mark tapped his finger on the counter of the third coffee shop that morning, eying the large mason jar with "Profanity Tax" scrawled on it. His hand twitched towards his wallet, but he resisted. Not today. 

He took his coffee and headed into the alley, knocking on the rusty metal door of a nondescript building. It slid open, and he slipped inside. Dim light illuminated a dozen people standing around a makeshift bar.

"Gimme a damn whiskey, straight up," Mark said. The bartender slid a glass over. 

Mark tossed it back, feeling the familiar burn in his throat. "Shit, I needed that."

The bartender grinned and held out a hand. Mark sighed and paid the "swear tax", double the cost of the drink. At least here he could speak freely without worry of fines.

Since the passage of the "Clean Speech Act", cursing had become a forbidden fruit, and Mark had discovered a taste for it. Out in the open, "profane" language could lead to hefty fines and even jail time. An entire black market had sprung up in response. 

Speakeasies like this one were tucked away, advertising by word of mouth and secret symbols. Members paid high prices and took risks to get in, but once inside anything went. People would stand around trading the most vulgar insults and curse-filled stories, all while draining expensive and illegal drinks.

Mark came for the whiskey and the freedom of speech, but lately stayed for a woman. Emma was a regular, always ready with a string of obscenities and a sly grin. She spotted him and came over, grabbing his hand. 

"This place is a shithole, huh?" she said with a squeeze, and Mark's heart skipped. Emma had a particular way with profane words that he found irresistible.

"Complete shithole," Mark agreed. "Run by assholes. But the damn whiskey's not bad."  

Emma threw back her head and laughed, the sound echoing off the walls. Mark leaned in, cupping her face for a rough kiss. She wrapped her arms around his neck and drew him closer, her cursing whispers in his ear making him shiver.

They stumbled out of the bar together some time later, drunk on illegal liquor and each other. The city outside lay under a blanket of fog, the swear jars on the empty streets faint shadows. 

Emma squeezed Mark's arm. "Let's get the hell out of here," she said. 

Mark couldn't agree more. As long as he had Emma and the secret bars, the damn government could keep its clean speech. He'd take the filthy underground any day.
