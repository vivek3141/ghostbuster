Joseph fidgeted nervously. He and Mary had agreed it was time to have "the talk" with Jesus, but now that the moment was here, he felt unprepared. 

Jesus bounded into the room, energetic and curious as always. "You wanted to speak with me, father?"

Joseph cleared his throat. "Yes, my son. Please, sit down. Your mother and I have something important to discuss with you."

Jesus sat, his bright eyes flickering between his parents.

Mary gave Joseph an encouraging nod. "My dear Jesus," Joseph began. "You have grown into a fine young man. And as you become a man, it's time you understood certain...things."

"About how babies are made," Mary interjected gently. 

"Oh!" Jesus exclaimed. "The little lambs in the fields, I've seen how they are born. And the baby birds in their nests. Father feeds the seed, and mother nourishes the baby in her womb until it's time."

Joseph's jaw dropped. He looked at Mary in astonishment. She appeared just as surprised. 

Jesus gazed at them with innocence. "Did I say something wrong?"

Mary touched Jesus' cheek. "No, my sweet child. You are as wise as always. We just wanted to make sure you understood these matters before you became a man."

"But I am not like other men," Jesus said, his bright eyes dimming for a moment.

"No, you are not," Mary agreed. She took Jesus into her arms. Joseph put his arms around them both, and for a long moment they simply held each other, parent and child and gift of the ages, close under the watching stars.
