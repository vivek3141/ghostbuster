The voices came as a surprise. As I focused my mind and tapped into the consciousness of the barista, suddenly her voice filled my head. 

"What's happening?" she asked, panicking. I guided her hands to make my coffee, trying to ignore her confusion.

With practice I got better at blocking out the voices. I only heard whispers of protests as I manipulated people to my will. I told myself it was for the greater good.

Until I connected with the mind of a young child. Her fear and confusion rang in my head as I moved her arms. "Why are you doing this?" she cried. "I want my mommy!"

I released her immediately, horrified at myself. I had become a puppet master, controlling lives without consent. The voices I had ignored were people, frightened and pleading. 

My ability was a curse, not a gift. From that day on I vowed never again to control another person. The power was locked away in my mind, hopefully forever. And the voices that had once troubled me were silenced, finally at peace. My secret would stay hidden, and I alone would bear the burden of knowing what I was capable of. Never again.
