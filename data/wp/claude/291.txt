The Krokxian ship slipped out of hyperspace near the small blue planet. After extensive long-range scans, they had concluded this was a suitable system for colonization. Their scans indicated a lush, temperate world with abundant natural resources. 

Commander Glork rubbed his tentacles together in anticipation. His crew had prepared for decades to find a new home. Their own world was damaged beyond repair, its resources depleted and environment destroyed by their ancestors’ carelessness. They dreamed of a fresh start.

As the ship entered orbit, sensors lit up with activity. Glork's hearts sank - the planet showed clear signs of technology. Massive cities sprawled across the continents, connected by a planetary transportation grid.It seemed they were not the first to covet this world.

Glork steeled himself and opened communications. As First Contact envoy, it was his duty to greet the locals. A bipedal alien with pink skin and no tentacles appeared. It spoke in a strange tongue which the ship's computer translated:

“Greetings. This is a human from the planet Earth. We have achieved faster-than-light travel and colonized three other systems. How may we assist you?”

Glork introduced himself as a peaceful explorer seeking a new home. The human smiled, revealing rows of white, flesh-ripping teeth. 

"We understand your need for a home. However, this system belongs to humanity. I suggest you do not settle here. It would be...unwise."  

The alien's threat was clear. Glork ended the call in terror. His hearts racing, exuding anxiety pheromones, he ordered the ship back to hyperspace. The Krokians would need to continue their search. If the rest of the galaxy cowered in fear of these humans as he did now, Glork understood why. Humans were the true monsters of the stars.
