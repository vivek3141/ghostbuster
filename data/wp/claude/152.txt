The Enchanted Truth 

Snow White was the first to realize that something wasn't quite right with her storybook ending. As she gazed out the window of the dwarves' cottage, she noticed the old hag had not actually fallen to her death after eating the poisoned apple. Instead, the hag was limping through the forest, cursing and sputtering about revenge.

Snow White confronted Prince Charming, demanding to know why he had lied. He admitted that the happy ending had been constructed to quickly wrap up the story. "The truth is life is far more complicated than that," he said sadly. 

Snow White agreed to keep up appearances to preserve the fantasy of the fairytale kingdom. But inwardly, her heart turned as cold as the white snow she was named for.

The same realization soon dawned on Cinderella as she endured public appearances with her vain stepmother and cruel stepsisters, who had not actually disappeared after the ball.  Each time she squeezed her dainty feet into the glass slippers, she felt sharp stabs of pain that no magic could erase.

One night, Aurora pricked her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and found that true love's kiss could not  break the curse of eternal slumber. She remained trapped in a dream within a dream, screaming silently at her useless Prince Phillip while the rest of the kingdom slumbered on.

Ariel the mermaid spent her days gazing at an unfamiliar horizon, longing for the comfort of her underwater home - and wondering if she had made a terrible mistake. Her voice and tail were gone forever, the price of her gamble for a fanciful life on land and a prince she barely knew.

The fairy tale princesses had their perfect endings ripped away, one by one, as they discovered the truth behind the lies. Their enchanted kingdoms continued under cover of night, but in the light of day, the cracks were beginning to show. Each princess in her own way grappled with escaping her doomed fate and reclaiming control of her story. But they had learned, too late, that happy endings were made for fairy tales, and the truth was no end at all.Their unquestioning belief in love and magic and fate had blinded them to the duplicity of those who claimed to have their best interests at heart. Now they would pay the price for their idealism and naivety. The end was just the beginning of their real challenges. Their real stories had only just begun.
