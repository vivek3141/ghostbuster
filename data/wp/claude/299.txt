The old general gazed out at the battlefield. His legions vanquished, his city besieged. All lost in a single reckless charge.

His attendant approached hesitantly. "Sir, the invaders demand your surrender. What are your orders?"  

The general turned, eyes fiery but legs unsteady. "Tell the men to stand down. Open the gates."

As the attendant rushed off, the general slumped into his throne. His eyes gazed across the maps and relics of past glories surrounding him. 

A lone tear fell. "My hubris, my undoing. The seeds I sowed, now reaped in full."

He grasped his sword, tarnished but true, and rose shakily. The end approaching, but pride intact.

Head raised, he declared to the empty hall, "It was so grand. All of it. No regrets, just gratitude. The honor was mine alone."

With that, the old lion strode out to meet his fate.
