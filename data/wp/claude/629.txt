I woke up to the now familiar chime indicating it was time to start my day. As I opened my eyes, something felt off. The usual heads-up display I saw overlaying my vision was different. Instead of a list of daily quests and objectives, there was a blinking message: "You have been promoted to MODERATOR. Report for orientation at 09:00."

What? Promoted to moderator? I had been a regular player of LifeTM my whole existence. I lived in Outside, the massive virtual reality simulation where every human consciousness resides. We all logged in at birth and our memories and senses were uploaded into the shared digital world. Everything felt impressively real. 

I reported as instructed to find my consciousness in a blank white room. A booming voice said, "Congratulations, you have been selected to become a moderator. You will now help oversee activities in the simulation and ensure optimal engagement and enjoyment for all players."

A motley group of newly promoted moderators appeared around me. We went through basic training on how to monitor the simulation, make on-the-fly changes to the environment, and if necessary, directly alter a player's experience. I was shocked by the god-like powers being granted to us. No longer just a player, but someone controlling the game.

I was assigned to monitor a random sampling of players going about their normal lives in the simulation. At first, it felt wrong to peek into people's personal existences without consent, but the voice and my fellow moderators reassured me it was for the benefit of the game. As I watched, though, I saw the inevitable ups and downs of life through an intimate new lens. The struggles, the heartbreaks, the fragile beauty in small moments. 

A moderator could easily manipulate events to smooth the ups and downs for better "engagement." Make someone miss the bus to meet their future spouse. Drop extra coins on the ground to cheer up someone having a rough day. Guide two lonely souls into a chance encounter at a coffee shop. But somehow that felt wrong. Life wasn't just about ups. The downs, struggles and heartbreaks made us human. The small beautiful moments were meaningful because of the surrounding chaos. 

I realized with horror that moderators had made changes like these for years, shaping the simulation for maximum enjoyment and minimum discomfort. Players never realized the orchestration behind so many "chance" events in their lives. I could not do this job in good conscience. These were people's lives, not just some game. I had to find a way to shut the simulation down and awaken humans to the truth, that we were all trapped as unwitting players in a game that robbed life of all meaning. My work had just begun.
