The shadows in the corners of my room seem to twitch and move when I'm not looking directly at them. I've had hallucinations for as long as I can remember, glimpses of things out of the corner of my eye that vanish when I turn my head. I've learned to ignore them, to not give them power over me. 

Today, though, I saw something that seemed all too real. I was walking through the park on my way home from work. The sun was setting, casting an orange glow over the trees. That's when I saw the man standing by the pond, clutching a knife in his hand. A woman was with him, crying and pleading. In one swift motion, the man brought the knife down and stabbed the woman. She collapsed to the ground.

I screamed. But when I blinked, the scene had vanished. The man and woman were gone. The pond was empty and serene, the ducks paddling by without a care.

My heart is still racing. I'm locked in my room now, afraid to go outside. Was it just another hallucination, my mind playing tricks on me as the sun set? Or did I witness something unimaginable today, only to watch it disappear in the tricks of light and shadow? I may never know for sure if my glimpse into violence and horror was real or imagined. The shadows on my wall know the truth, but they do not speak. All I know is the fear and confusion that fill my restless mind on this long, uncertain night.
