Janice turned to me, her big blue eyes still full of childish innocence. Damn- I'd forgotten that she was watching the Presidential Inauguration for a school project. 

'Daddy,' she began, 'what does the President mean? What's'gay'?'

I froze, panicking. How was I going to explain this to my 8-year old daughter? But there was no escaping it now. 

"Well, honey, the President is the leader of our country. His job is to make important decisions and guide the nation," I began hesitantly.

"But what did he mean when he said he supports 'gay' rights?" she asked curiously. 

I took a deep breath. "You're right, that's an important question. 'Gay' is a term used to describe someone who loves people of the same gender. The President was saying that he believes people should have the freedom to love whoever they choose."

Janice looked confused. "But why would someone love a person of the same gender?"

"Because love is complex, and it's not about the gender of the people involved. Some men happen to fall in love with other men, and some women fall in love with other women. And that's okay."

Janice considered this, then smiled. "That makes sense. People should be free to love whoever they want."

I sighed in relief and gave her a hug. "Yes, exactly. I'm glad you understand." 

Janice always had a wisdom beyond her years. While I was worried about how she might react, she took the concept of gay rights completely in stride. Kids often have a natural open-mindedness that is a lesson for all of us. 

In that moment, despite the difficult conversation, I felt incredibly grateful and proud to be raising a daughter like Janice in a country making progress on equality and acceptance. Her response gave me hope for a more compassionate future.
