The massive engines of the interstellar spacecraft rumbled as I began my descent back to Earth. After 5 years travelling to Alpha Centauri and back, I was finally home. From my viewport, I could see the familiar blue marble getting larger and larger. 

As I entered the atmosphere, the familiar geography of Earth came into view. The continent of Africa, then Europe. But something seemed off. There were no lights visible on the dark side of the planet. I double checked my navigation systems - I was definitely approaching Earth. Perhaps there was a global power outage?

I landed at the designated NASA facility in Florida where I had departed 5 years ago. But the facility looked abandoned. The buildings were dark and falling into disrepair. The landing pad was overgrown with weeds. There were no teams on the ground to greet me. An icy feeling of dread crept into my stomach.

I explored the abandoned NASA facility with a flashlight. It was as if everyone had just suddenly left. Half-finished experiments and old coffee cups were still sitting out, now covered in layers of dust. My unease grew. What happened here? Where did everyone go?

In a former mission control building, I searched through the desks and lockers for any clues. Most of the technology had been stripped from the room, but I found an old portable radio that still worked. I tuned it to different frequencies, but all I picked up was static. The realization hit me - there seemed to be no radio signals at all.

Panic started to set in as the truth became unavoidable - there had been some catastrophe in my absence that had wiped humanity from the planet. A nuclear war? A deadly plague? An asteroid impact? Whatever tragedy had struck, I returned to a dead, silent world.

I was in shock. Just 5 years ago when I left, the Earth was vibrant and full of life. How could so much have changed in the time I was gone? I always knew my mission came with risks, but I never considered I would return to find humanity extinct. 

The sun began to rise over the horizon, and in the warm glow of morning I saw birds flying in the distance. At least there was still some life on the planet. But without humans, Earth felt empty. I was the last human, a person out of time, a relic of a lost age. My epic journey to another star system and back suddenly felt bitterly ironic. I came home to Earth, but in the end, I found only solitude.
