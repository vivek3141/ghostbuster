You're sitting in your kitchen eating breakfast when a man in a lab coat walks in and says, 'The experiment is over. Thank you for your time.'  

I nearly choke on my cereal. A stranger just walked into my house like he owns the place. And what experiment is he talking about?

The man notices my confusion. "Apologies for startling you. My name is Dr. Smith. I'm a researcher running an experiment you volunteered for several years ago to test the long-term effects of an memory-adjusting treatment."

My mind reels. I don't remember any such experiment. But something about the man seems familiar, like a memory I can't quite grasp. 

Dr. Smith continues, "The treatment was designed to suppress certain memories to assist in coping with trauma. We've been monitoring you since the procedure. I'm here today to restore the memories we suppressed and complete our study."

Panic rises in my chest. What memories did they take from me? And how did I consent to this without realizing it?

Dr. Smith pulls out a leather case and opens it to reveal a futuristic-looking device with blinking lights and tubes filled with neon liquid. My heart hammers as he approaches me, instrument in hand. 

He says, "Please remain calm. This will activate the stored memories in your mind. Your recollection of the procedure and events surrounding your trauma should come flooding back shortly."

Before I can protest, he places the device at my temple. A sharp prickling sensation radiates through my skull.  

Suddenly, hidden memories burst forth like a dam breaking free. I'm in a hospital bed, distraught after the death of my young daughter in a car accident. Dr. Smith is there, promising a radical new treatment to mitigate my inconsolable grief. I grasp at the possibility of respite from this anguish and agree to anything.  

The next memory is of the procedure. Vague sensations of flashes and foreign sounds and chemicals course through my veins. The details of my daughter's life, death and funeral are slipping away like water through my fingers no matter how desperately I try to hold on.

I come out of the memory with tears streaming down my face. Dr. Smith is peering at me intently, assessing my reaction. Anger and grief and confusion battle within me. How could I forget my own daughter? And yet, I realize with glum resignation that the procedure dulled a pain too great to withstand.  

Dr. Smith breaks the silence. "The effects appear reversible. We have been experimenting with using targeted memory suppression to treat severe trauma. Now that I've restored your full memory, I will be analyzing the results to better determine efficacy and improve theâ€”"

"Get out." My voice is perilously quiet.  

Dr. Smith stammers an apology and beats a hasty retreat. I lock the door behind him and slide to the floor, mourning my daughter anew as memories of her wash over me, as fresh as the day she was taken. The experiment is over. I wish the pain could end as easily. But some memories, for better or worse, are forever.
