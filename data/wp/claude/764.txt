Little Jenny was excited to have her first loose tooth. She wiggled it all day with her tongue until it finally came out in her hand that evening. "Mommy, look! My tooth fell out! The Tooth Fairy is going to come tonight!"

Her mom smiled. "Why yes, she is! Put it under your pillow before you go to bed and the Tooth Fairy will leave you a special treat."

Jenny put the tiny tooth under her pillow and went to sleep, dreaming of what the Tooth Fairy might bring. A few coins? Some fairy dust? 

In the middle of the night, something woke Jenny. She felt something large and solid under her pillow. Puzzled, she pulled it out. In the dim light, she saw a large gold bar, almost as big as a brick, under her pillow. Her eyes grew wide. Was this really from the Tooth Fairy? She snapped on her light to get a better look. Sure enough, there was a little note attached: "Dear Jenny, Baby teeth are worth their weight in gold these days. Enjoy! Love, The Tooth Fairy."

The next morning, Jenny could barely contain her excitement as she told her parents about the gold bar. They were shocked. Baby teeth skyrocketing in value? This didn't make sense. Her dad examined the gold bar. "This looks real," he muttered. 

Jenny's news spread fast around the neighborhood. Soon, children were wiggling their teeth eager for them to fall out. The Thompson twins both lost teeth the same day, and found twin gold bars under their pillows that night. Mark down the street lost two teeth in one week and received two gold bars.

Parents were dumbfounded. Where was all this gold coming from? And why did the Tooth Fairy suddenly value baby teeth so highly? They scoured the news but found no reports of gold prices spiking or baby teeth becoming priceless commodities overnight.  

Little Jenny, however, was overjoyed with her newfound wealth. During recess, she traded two of her gold bars with Billy for a coveted holographic Charizard Pok√©mon card. Mark traded his gold bars for a top-of-the-line dirt bike to ride around the neighborhood. The Thompson twins pooled their gold together to buy a waterslide for their backyard.

The Tooth Fairy's gold bars were fueling an underground children's barter economy based on trading valuable toys, cards, and other goods. Teachers and parents scratched their heads as children came to school with extravagant show-and-tell items and crazy stories of weekend adventures.   

No one could figure out why baby teeth were skyrocketing in value or how the Tooth Fairy was distributing these gold bars. But for the local children, questions like that hardly seemed to matter as they embarked on magical childhoods filled with wonders now open to them, thanks to the mysterious and whimsical Tooth Fairy.
