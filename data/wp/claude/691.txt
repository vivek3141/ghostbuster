The Time Tourists  

I first noticed something strange was happening a few months ago. There were little oddities, small things that seemed out of place. A coin from 2032 in my change jar. A wrapper from a candy bar that shouldn't exist yet. 

At first I dismissed it as pranks by friends or simply products that were released in other countries first. But the anachronisms started piling up. A magazine from next year. A ticket stub from a movie that wouldn't be released for months.

It finally dawned on me one day as I was throwing out the trash. There, stuffed in the bin, was a crumpled up tourism brochure for "Time Tours â€“ Experience the Wonder of Tomorrow...Today!" My hands started shaking as I smoothed the creased paper and read the details. For a hefty fee, people from the future could book guided tours into the past. My past, apparently. 

I slumped against the wall, my mind racing. Why would people be travelling back in time to my era? Did I do something important enough to warrant historical tours? Or something terrible? Was I some pivotal figure who shaped the future, for better or worse?

The brochure made it clear that interacting with the past was forbidden. No talking to locals or interfering in events. "Observe but do not disturb," it said. The time tourists were advised to avoid any contact beyond casual nods, and to clean up after themselves as to not pollute the timeline. Clearly, some weren't following the rules, or I wouldn't have found that crumpled brochure. 

Despite the warnings, I became obsessed with trying to spot the time tourists. I scrutinized everyone in public, searching for some sign they were from the future. Did that person walk with outdated mannerisms? Did they stare in wonder at mundane objects? It was maddening not knowing why I was a spectacle for these voyeurs invading my life from tomorrow.

Weeks passed and aside from a few more detritus from ahead of my time, I found no real evidence of the tourists. Until one night. Leaving the library, I glanced into an alley and saw the unmistakable glow of a temporal field generator, the device that enabled time travel. Two figures in nondescript grey suits emerged, stumbling slightly with the disorientation of entering a different era. 

Then I gasped. One of them was me! An older me, maybe thirty years removed, but undeniably myself. The other traveller was a stranger, but he clasped hands with my elder self like an old friend. They straightened up, smoothed their clothes, and peered around with obvious delight of reliving a memory long past.

Before they noticed me gaping at them, I hurried off into the night, my mind shattered by what I had witnessed. I now knew I did something in the future amazing or terrible enough to become a fixture of history tours. And stranger still, I would eventually use time travel to return to this very night and relive events as a tourist. My head swam at the paradoxes in play. 

The next day, I searched the library archives for any mention of my future self but found nothing. My fate, it seems, was still unwritten. I realized with a chill that meant there were likely multiple versions of future me visiting this era, from branches of time not yet determined. 

Tonight I will go out again, wondering if once more I might glimpse impossible versions of what is to come, not yet knowing what I might do to shape the course of history, for ill or good. The future remains as hazy as ever, while the present has become a place out of time.
