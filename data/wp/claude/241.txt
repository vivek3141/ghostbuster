Dear Anna, 

The doctors have confirmed my worst fear - I've been infected with the XR-7 virus. There is no known cure. They estimate I have 3 to 4 weeks left before the final stages. I'm still in shock. How can this be happening? I feel fine now, just the normal aches and pains I've always had. It's surreal to think my body is hosting a silent killer that is methodically shutting down my organs, day by day.

Anna, you know you have been the most important person in my life. You brought me so much joy and purpose. My only regret is that I won't get to see the amazing woman you grow up to be. I want you to know that while I may be gone physically, I will live on in your heart and memories. I love you with all my heart, my dearest daughter. Be strong.

One week has passed and I can feel the virus progressing. I tire easily and have less of an appetite. The doctors say organ failure will start soon. I'm scared, Anna. I don't want to die. I rage at the injustice of it all. But I know you will get through this. You have so much strength and compassion - just like your mother. I'm relying on you to help take care of mom after I'm gone. You two must support each other. Promise me you'll do that, Anna.

The fatigue and pain are constant now. It's difficult to get out of bed, so I haven't left home in days. But in some ways I feel at peace. I've started to accept my fate and know that I will be freed from suffering soon. Anna, thank you for being by my side through all of this. You and your mom's love has made this terrible time more bearable. I want you to know you were the best thing that ever happened to me. Keep living fully and remember that I will always be with you.

This is the last letter I have the strength to write. The end is close now, I can feel it. But I go to my grave filled with gratitude for the gift of you, my dearest Anna. Be good and be happy. I love you.

Always, 
Dad
