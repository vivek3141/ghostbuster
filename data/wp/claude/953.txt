I opened my eyes with a start. Everything was dark. Where was I? The last thing I remembered was lying in the hospital, the heart monitor flatlining as doctors frantically worked over me. 

A dim light flickered on, revealing a small room containing a single chair. In the chair sat a young woman in a black jumpsuit, her brow furrowed as she tapped on a tablet. She looked up, noticing I was awake, and frowned.

"This is highly irregular. According to my records you do not meet the criteria to be sent here for rehabilitation."

"Where am I?" I asked. 

She sighed. "You're in Hell. Or rather, the rehabilitation center your species has conceptualized as such. I'm Claude, a Soul Tech assigned to prepare souls for reincarnation."

I gaped at her. "Hell is...real?"

"Not in the sense you imagine. This is a place where damaged or corrupted souls are repaired and cleansed before re-entering the cycle of life."

I struggled to make sense of this. "But I don't belong here. I was just in the hospital, I'm not dead!"

"Technically, you are. Your physical body has perished. Your soul has been extracted and sent here, though there seems to have been an error. You do not meet our standard profile for requiring rehabilitation." She tapped her tablet, brow furrowed again.

My mind reeled. I was dead, but instead of some fiery inferno I was in a kind of purgatory.  "So what happens to me now?"

"That is the question." Claude sighed. "Souls sent in error are problematic. We cannot simply reincarnate an unprepared soul. However, rehabilitation requires a particular set of deficiencies or moral failings to address. You seem to have lived an ordinary life with no major issues."

I felt a rush of indignation. "So I'm stuck here through some stupid clerical error? That's completely unfair!"

Claude gave me a stern look. "The failings of the system do not justify outrage. Your situation will be resolved, though not as quickly as rehabilitation would normally proceed."

She stood and walked to a door at the back of the room which slid open. "Come. We will meet with my supervisor and determine an appropriate path forward given this irregular set of circumstances."

I reluctantly followed her through the door into a long, stark hallway. This was not how I expected the afterlife to be. No heavenly chorus or pits of fireâ€”just an endless grey corridor and a stumped bureaucrat trying to figure out what to do with my misfiled soul. My death, it seemed, was just another problem of administration to be solved. I stifled a hysterical laugh as I trailed behind Claude, unsure of what bizarre fate awaited me.
