The old lamp gleamed as I rubbed it. With a puff of smoke, the genie appeared. “I shall grant you three wishes, master. But be warned, I interpret wishes quite figuratively.”

For my first wish, I asked for wealth. The genie snapped his fingers. “Granted. You are now figuratively wealthy in relationships and health.”

I frowned. This genie was trickier than I thought. For my second wish, I asked for fame. 

The genie bowed. “You are now figuratively famous for your kindness and generosity.”

Annoyed at being thwarted again, Ipaused before my final wish. I asked the genie to end world hunger.

He smiled. “Your wish is granted. World hunger can now figuratively end whenever people choose to open their hearts to compassion.”

I sighed in frustration. The genie had twisted my words again. But on reflection, I realized something. Though not what I originally intended, the genie's gifts were precious. My life was now enriched, and I had the power to help others in a meaningful way. 

Sometimes getting what you want isn't as important as appreciating what you have. The genie's figurative magic gave me insights I never expected. With a grateful smile, Ibid the genie farewell. His figurative gifts were the most valuable of all.
