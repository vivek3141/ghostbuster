The wails echoed through the fiery caverns of Hell. Satan sighed, dropping his pitchfork and trudging over to the massive obsidian crib where hundreds of babies squirmed and cried. 

Being the Prince of Darkness was not all fun and games. Ever since the cults started with their "sacrifices to Satan" a few centuries ago, Hell had been inundated with souls of babies and young children. Satan now spent most of his time changing diapers, preparing bottles, and trying to get the little ones to nap.

As Satan peered into the crib, a particularly chubby baby reached up his pudgy arms, giggling with delight at the red, horned face looking down at him. Despite himself, Satan chuckled.  "Alright, alright, little Phillip, up you come." He lifted the baby out, holding him against his chest. Phillip cooed, grasping at Satan's long, pointed beard. 

In the next chamber, a ring of toddlers were engaged in an unruly game of "Demon Says," shouting and hopping around with tiny, leathery wings flapping.  "Now now, settle down," Satan boomed, "Who wants a snack?" The toddlers shrieked with glee, swarming around Satan's cloven hooves as he passed out cups of milk and platters of worm jerky. 

Putting Phillip in a magically suspended baby bouncer, Satan started a fire and set about making dinner for the older kids. Grilled soul sandwiches were usually a hit. As the meals cooked, a tug on his robes made him turn. A little girl with fangs and a spiked tail looked up at him. "Will you read us a story?" she asked sweetly.

Satan grinned, his sharp teeth glinting in the firelight. "Of course, my dear. Gather round!" The children snuggled close to him as he chose a well-worn copy of 'Goodnight Hellfires' from the shelf. 

As Satan read to the now fed and calming children, he sighed contentedly. This was why he did it. Not for the glory or the corruption of souls. But for the chance to care for these little lost ones, unwanted and unloved in the mortal world, who now had a home here in his arms. His chest swelled with a warmth quite unlike hellfire. Father of Darkness he may be, but a father first and foremost. The End.
