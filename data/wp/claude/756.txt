The Guild of Interdimensional Locksmiths 

Jenna inserted her tesseract key into the shimmering portal and twisted to the left, disengaging the entropy locks that secured this rift between dimensions. As a senior locksmith in the Guild of Interdimensional Locksmiths, opening unauthorized wormholes was just another day at the office.

Interdimensional locks were finicky things. They required a mastery of exotic matter, string theory, and psionics to properly install and maintain. The tesseract keys the locksmiths carried were equally complex, morphing through multiple dimensions simultaneously with intricate shape-shifting geodesics. One false twist or malfunctioning quaternion axis could cause a key to slip out of 5-D space entirely, never to return. The schooling was long and perilous.

Through the portal, Jenna could glimpse a vivid nebula in an alien sky, its ethereal clouds swirling with colors not meant for human eyes. Her client had requested transit to the 53rd Plane of Torment, one of the less pleasant dimensions—though still a popular destination for “dark tourism.” She checked her transdimensional GPS and made a few minute adjustments to the portal’s pulsating rim to shift its exit aperture to the proper dimensional coordinates. 

Satisfied, she radioed to the client that the unauthorized portal was ready. A few moments later, a ghastly figure emerged from the portal, dragging a semi-corporeal mass of life essences it had gathered, like a fisherman’s catch. The creature hissed its pleasure at the fruits of another successful hunt. It transmitted payment in the form of a few shimmering dark energy crystals, a currency accepted in most dimensions.

“Safe travels, honored customer,” Jenna said. The creature gurgled in response and plunged back through the portal, hauling its wailing prey. Jenna deactivated the wormhole and packed up her gear, mission accomplished. The Interdimensional Locksmith’s Guild had strict rules against interfering with clients or their unsavory hobbies. As locksmiths, they merely enabled access—whatever or whomever passed through a portal was not their concern. Jenna sighed, already mentally preparing herself for the next unauthorized rip through the fabric of reality the Guild would inevitably call upon her skills to open.
