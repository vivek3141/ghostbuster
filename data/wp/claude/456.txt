The Midlands were eerily silent as John trudged down the crumbling remains of the M6 motorway. Rusting husks of cars and trucks littered the road, remnants of a panic that seized the country two decades ago. 

When the bombs fell, John was just a boy living in Birmingham with his parents. He remembered the blinding flash and deafening blast as the city was engulfed in a sea of fire. His family fled south towards London, hoping to find refuge, but the capital was already a smoldering ruin. They pushed on towards the coast, struggling to stay ahead of the choking clouds of fallout, finally finding an abandoned farmhouse to call shelter.

His parents eventually succumbed to radiation sickness, their bodies now buried under the collapsed barn. John stayed on, surviving on what little he could scavenge from the overgrown fields and orchards. His only companion was a tattered map of Britain he found in the farmhouse, stained and burnt but still legible. As a boy, he would trace the lines of roads and rivers, imagining what adventures they might lead to. One place in particular caught his attention, an ‘X’ marking a spot on the Jurassic Coast with a single word: ‘Treasure’.

Now in his thirties, John was making his way to that ‘X’, pulling a trolley of supplies behind him. He didn’t know what awaited him there, if anything at all, but after years of isolation the mystery was too tantalizing to ignore. The map showed him following the M6 south, then turning off towards the coast at Bridport. From there, a series of smaller roads wove through the hills to the sea.

The journey was perilous, many roads and bridges had collapsed. More than once John had to turn back and find another path. radioactive hotspots still lingered, and he watched his Geiger counter closely. After a week of hiking, he crested a hill and caught his first glimpse of the sea in 20 years, a strip of deep blue under billowing white clouds. His heart swelled at the sight.

John made camp that night with renewed energy. The next day he arrived at the ‘X’ on his map, a crumbling cliff edge overlooking a rocky beach. There were no signs of any treasure, no telltale mounds or markings in the grass. His heart sank as he realized it was probably just the fanciful imagination of some long-dead cartographer. 

As the sun dipped towards the horizon, John slumped down next to his trolley, overcome with exhaustion and defeat. But then something caught the fading light, a metallic glint half-buried in the dirt. He brushed away the soil to find a small metal box, its edges carved with intricate patterns. Inside was a single piece of yellowed paper. Four words were scrawled across it in fading ink: ‘There is still hope.’

John gazed out at the sea, tears welling up in his eyes. The treasure was real after all, and his journey was not in vain. As darkness settled over the coast, a small flicker of light kindled in his heart. There was still hope.
