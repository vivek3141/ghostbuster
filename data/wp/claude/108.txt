God descended from the heavens and appeared before two ordinary people, Jack and Jill. "I have decided to grant you both omnipotence, unlimited power and abilities," God proclaimed.

Jack and Jill could hardly believe their luck. They had been given a gift of immeasurable power. They could do anything they desired with a mere thought.

"However, there is one condition," God said. "You must use your omnipotence for the greater good. If at any point you abuse this power for selfish or unethical reasons, you will immediately lose this ability." 

Jack and Jill readily agreed. They were overjoyed at the opportunity to help humanity. For months, they eliminated poverty, cured diseases, ended wars, and solved the world's problems. The world entered a golden age of peace and prosperity.

One day, Jill was walking down the street and saw a man yelling at a homeless person. She waved her hand and erased the man from existence in a burst of light. 

Jack witnessed this and confronted Jill. "How could you do that? You killed him in cold blood just for yelling. We have a responsibility to only use our power for good!"

Jill's eyes glowed red with rage. "Don't tell me what I can and can't do, Jack. I will use my power as I see fit. If I want to kill someone for annoying me, I will!"

At that moment, there was a blinding flash. Jill's power vanished, and the damage she did was undone. God appeared once again. "You have failed the test, Jill. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Your omnipotence is no more."

God turned to Jack. "Well done, my faithful servant. You shall keep your gift, and together we will continue making the world a better place."
