The old clock in the hall chimed midnight. Mary jolted awake, unsure of what disturbed her slumber. A creak from downstairs sent a chill down her spine. Someone was in the house.  

She grabbed the baseball bat by her bed and slowly descended the stairs, her heart pounding. A dark figure was rummaging through the living room. An intruder.

 Mary flicked on the light switch. The figure spun around, startled by the sudden illumination. It was not a person at all, but a specter clad in black, a skull for a face. The Grim Reaper.

Her blood ran cold. It had come for her grandfather, who was upstairs sleeping.  He had been battling illness for months now. She stammered in panic, "No, please! Take me instead!"

The Reaper paused and considered her offer. It nodded in agreement. The bargain was struck.   

Mary raced upstairs as her memories of her grandfather started to fade. She burst into his room, waking him. "Grandpa, I love you!" she cried as she hugged him tight. 

He was confused but hugged her back. "I love you too, dear. Did you have a nightmare?" 

She nodded, tears flowing down her cheeks. She knew this would be the last time she saw him, though she couldn't remember why. The Reaper's chilling touch was wiping him from her mind.
 
The Reaper appeared in the doorway, its bony finger beckoning her to come. She wiped her tears and put on a brave face. 

Her grandfather looked concerned. "Are you alright, Mary?"  

She mustered a smile. "I'm ok, Grandpa. Just a bad dream. I love you." 

"I love you too." He patted her hand. 

Mary stood and followed the Reaper out of the room without looking back, her memory of the house and her grandfather fading with each step. By the time she and the Reaper vanished from the house, the memory was gone. All that remained was a feeling of deep love and sacrifice.

Her grandfather would live on peacefully, never knowing how close Death had come that night or the granddaughter that gave her life so that he might live. Such was the bargain she had made. A life for a life, and a memory taken as the price.
