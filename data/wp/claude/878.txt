The massive engines roared to life, shaking the ancient hull of the generation ship Avenger. Most of the current inhabitants didn't recognize the sound, nor did they understand it. Knowledge of the ship's systems and technology had been lost generations ago, not long after the Avenger first launched from Earth nearly 1,000 years prior. 

Kara was tending to the village's crops when the ground began trembling. She looked around in confusion and fear. Her whole life the ship had felt motionless, as steady as the stone and metal walls of the cavern they lived in. But now it felt like the whole world was moving.

The village elder, Tyco, emerged from his dwelling. "What sorcery is this?" he shouted. None of the villagers had an answer. The shaking intensified, and a thunderous boom echoed through the cavern as the main engines ignited and pushed the Avenger to speeds it hadn't reached since initial acceleration long ago.

Emergency lights flickered on across the hull, illuminating parts of the cavern for the first time in centuries. The villagers cowered in their dwellings, believing the noises and lights were angry spirits or vengeful gods. All except Kara, who was overwhelmed with curiosity.

She left the village and climbed up one of the metal ladders that led to the upper levels. Her people had long ago forbidden going up there, afraid of the strange rooms and long-dead machinery. But Kara's curiosity won out. 

The ladder led to a sealed doorway. To Kara's surprise, it slid open with a hiss as she approached. Bright light spilled out of the room beyond.

It was a massive chamber, filled with rows of terminals and screens, all mysteriously glowing and blinking. Strange symbols and images moved on the screens. It was magic, it had to be. Yet, it felt familiar somehow. Like a memory from a dream.

One large screen caught her eye. It showed a massive sphere, mostly blue with swaths of green and white. She walked up to it, reaching out to touch the strange surface. When her fingers made contact, a voice spoke!

"Destination planet reached. Initiate landing sequence."

Kara gasped, stumbling back from the screen and terminal. "Who said that?" she shouted. 

"I am the Avenger's computer system. We have reached the planet selected as our destination when the generation ship launched from Earth 972 years ago."

Kara blinked, trying to make sense of the voice and its words. "Planet? Earth? What are you saying?"

There was a pause. "My apologies. It appears knowledge about the ship's mission and systems has not been maintained during the multi-generational journey. I will explain."

The computer began recounting the tale of the massive colony ship launched from Earth long ago, built to traverse the stars over hundreds of years to deliver its passengers to a new world for settlement. Kara listened with a mixture of wonder, disbelief, and a strange sense of familiarity with the concepts, as if she had heard echoes of this story as a child but not understood them.

"We have arrived at our destination and will land outside the cavern your people have inhabited for generations. The ship's functions will return to normal, and the doors and systems throughout the ship will reopen to provide access to the surface," the computer said.

Kara stared at the images on the screen, the massive blue sphere now dominating it. A new world. After so many generations in the darkness and metal walls of the cavern, they would walk out onto the surface of an entirely new planet. Their long journey was finally over. They had arrived.
