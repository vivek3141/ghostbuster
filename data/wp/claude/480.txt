The pounding in his head was the first thing he noticed as he woke up. His eyes flickered open but the room was dimly lit. He was lying on a bed, that much was clear. But this wasn't his bed. Wasn't his room. 

Where am I? He thought. The last thing he remembered was leaving work and getting into his car. Everything after that was a blank.

He sat up slowly, nausea washing over him. His eyes started to adjust to the low light and he could make out a dingy, unkempt room. The wallpaper was peeling, stained in places. An unpleasant smell lingered in the air.

His heart began to race as panic set in. He had no idea where he was or how he got here. His mind strained to recall anything that could help explain what had happened, but there was nothing. Just a void where his memories should be. 

As he placed his feet on the cold floorboards, he noticed his shoes were caked in dirt. His hands felt sticky. He made his way to the light switch on the wall and with a deep breath, turned it on.

The bright light stung his eyes. But within seconds he gasped at the site before him. The walls were covered in photos, clippings and scribblings. Faces of people, names, dates. Arrows connecting certain items. His eyes moved across the wall of madness until stopping on a set of gruesome photos of a woman. She was bruised, tied up. The next photo showed her bloody and lifeless.

He stumbled back in shock, his heel catching on something on the floor. He spun around to find the object but could barely comprehend what he was seeing. Blood-soaked ropes, knives and other tools were laid out on a plastic tarp. His breath came in ragged gulps as he put his hands to his face, feeling the crusty patches on his skin. His memory was gone but the evidence was irrefutable. 

He was in the lair of a killer. A serial killer. 

Panicked, he knew he had to get out of this place. He opened the nearest door, leading into a grimy hallway. The stench of decay growing stronger. Bile rose in his throat as he moved into the shadowy corridor.  His addled mind raced, unable to process any of this.

More doors lined the hallway. He didn't want to look inside any of them but one door was already ajar, a sliver of light falling onto the floor. He peeked in and almost fainted at what he saw. Another body of a woman, naked and defiled, left on a table.

He stumbled down the stairs and tried the front door. Unlocked. He burst out into the cool night air, sucking in a breath not laced with the stench of death. His eyes wild, he didn't even know which direction to run. He just ran. 

His memory was gone but he feared it was because his mind couldn't handle the horrific truth of what he had done. He may never know who he really was or what led him to this point. All he knew was that he couldn't let the monster he had clearly become continue to exist. Not if there was anything human left in him. He ran from that place, and knew the only escape from himself was to keep on running.
