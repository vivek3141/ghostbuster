The writing prompt community on Reddit was buzzing. In the last few months, more and more stories and ideas that first appeared on the Reddit forum were showing up in major Hollywood movies, TV shows, books, and blogs. At first, a few coincidences seemed normal, but soon it became apparent that big media companies and professional writers were systematically pilfering ideas from the Reddit community to use in their own commercial work. 

Jenny was an avid Redditor and aspiring science fiction writer. She had posted a number of short stories and prompts to the /r/WritingPrompts subreddit over the years. Just a month ago, she was shocked to see a trailer for an upcoming sci-fi blockbuster that seemed to lift major plot points and concepts directly from a story she had posted. The movie was being hyped as an original work from a famous director and studio.

The Reddit writing community was up in arms. While some didn't mind the exposure and felt imitation was the sincerest form of flattery, most felt violated and taken advantage of. "These huge companies are making millions off of our ideas while we struggle as aspiring writers," complained Mike, another prolific contributor. 

A consensus started to emerge that something must be done to curb this intellectual theft and unfair exploitation. But what could a loose community of amateur writers do against the machinery of corporate media giants?

Jenny had an idea. She made a post proposing that the WritingPrompts subreddit go "private" for one month - make the forum accessible only to approved members. This would cut the media companies off from their source of ideas and put pressure on them to change their behavior. "We provide the seed corn that feeds their creativity," she wrote. "If we cut them off, they'll have to recognize our value and start paying prompt writers for optioning their ideas."

The proposal gained widespread support and the moderators of the subreddit agreed to take it private for a trial period. Almost immediately, the big media companies took notice of the blackout. Producers and showrunners accustomed to skimming the forum for inspiration suddenly found themselves cut off from the flow of ideas. 

Within a week, several of the major studios and production companies approached the moderators. They wanted access to the forum restored, and they expressed an interest in establishing a system to license ideas, pay for optional prompts, and credit the original prompt authors. 

A lively debate ensued, but in the end, the writing community got what they wanted: recognition, respect, and a fair financial deal for the value they had provided for free for so long. When the private blackout period ended, the Reddit WritingPrompts subreddit had changed - now housing a bustling new marketplace where media companies could option trending ideas, aspiring prompt authors could get paid, and everyone benefitted from a new spirit of cooperation and mutual understanding.
