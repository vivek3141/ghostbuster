The silver orb hovered silently outside my window, reflective surface glinting in the morning sun. 

I stared at it in disbelief. Me, average? I always thought I was rather unremarkable but to be selected as the most average human seemed improbable.

A mechanical voice crackled from the orb, "Greetings human. I am Claude, an intergalactic device. I have analyzed all humans and selected you as the most statistically average to represent Earth."

My mouth gaped. This had to be an elaborate prank.

The orb flashed and a hologram of an alien appeared. It looked mostly humanoid except for the extra set of arms. "I am Zylth. I have been selected as the champion to represent the Zantac galaxy." His voiced boomed, "We have come to duel for the planet Earth as the ancient laws decree."

I sputtered, at a loss for words. How could this be happening?

"Do you accept the challenge or shall Earth be lost?" The hologram crossed two sets of burly arms, awaiting my response. 

All eyes turned to me, the supposedly "most average" person on Earth. There was no way I could win a duel against this alien champion. But to refuse the challenge meant the certain destruction of humanity.

I took a deep breath, steadying my nerves. The fate of the world rested on my shoulders. I had no choice. 

"I accept the duel." My voice wavered as I uttered the words that sealed my fate. I only hoped my defeat would at least be quick and painless. The future of Earth depended on it. My knuckles turned white as I readied to face my intergalactic challenger. The battle for Earth was about to begin.
