Taylor strummed her guitar, tears flowing down her face as the familiar chords of "Dear John" emerged. But this song was differentâ€”it wasn't for John Mayer. It was for Bruce. 

Bruce Wayne, the supposed playboy billionaire of Gotham City. He had seduced her with his charm, whisking her to lavish dates at the Iceberg Lounge and spending late nights chatting with her as she wrote songs. She thought they had something real. Until she saw the gossip rags speculating about Bruce's latest conquests.

Confronting him led to a nasty breakup. "You knew this was just for fun," Bruce had said coldly. "I'm not the type to settle down." 

Taylor was heartbroken. But her sadness turned to anger as she realized she had an opportunity for revenge. Bruce had shared one secret with her, thinking she'd never tell. But he had underestimated her ability to transform her pain into music.

She sat down and wrote a scathing ballad titled "Batman Blues." 

The lyrics hinted at the mysterious vigilante who prowled Gotham's streets at night, facing off against madmen and clowns. The song described a lonely figure clinging to darkness, unable to maintain real relationships. By the final verse, she had dropped all pretense of metaphor:

The Dark Knight returns each night, 
Hiding his true self from light.
Bruce Wayne, the playboy without heart,
Tearing my own in two parts.
Your secret's out, the game is through,
Gotham's hero, I'm calling you.
Batman Blues, Batman Blues,
Hiding beneath your Batsuit ruse.

When the single released, speculation exploded. Taylor gave coy nonanswers in interviews, letting fans connect the dots. Bruce barricaded himself in Wayne Manor, refusing to comment. 

Gotham grappled with the revelation that their favored son was the Caped Crusader himself. Bruce faced a reckoning for the dual life he'd led and the hearts he'd broken.

And Taylor? She got her revenge, turning her pain into profits and another platinum record. Her only regret was that she'd once given her own heart to Gotham City's Dark Knight in disguise. But she'd ensured his "secret" would remain a secret no more.
