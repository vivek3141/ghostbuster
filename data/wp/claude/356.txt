The six princes of Hell stood before the empty throne, each glaring at the others. The throne that had remained empty for eons since their fallen master had been cast into the abyss. 

Satan, the self-proclaimed champion of free will, scowled at the assembled fiends. "I led the rebellion against the flawed rule of the so-called God. The throne is mine by right."

Lucifer, the light bearer, scoffed. "Your independence brought us here, trapped in this infernal realm of fire and brimstone. You are unfit to rule." His beautiful visage glowed with contempt.

Beelzebub, the lord of the flies, hissed through the mandibles of his grotesque form. "You both ssspeak of right but have no true claim. Issh it not the infernal law that might makess right?" His pestilent swarm buzzed in agitation.  

Abbadon, the destroyer, slammed his black axe into the obsidian floor, cracking it. "You all talk and plot and scheme. I act. The throne should go to one who will unleash destruction upon the mortal realm without pause or mercy."  

Belial, the deceiver, smiled his silver-tongued smile. "Dear brothers, why squabble? I only wish for the good of Hell. Let me rule and I shall grant you all that you desire." His honeyed words dripped with false sincerity.  

Leviathan, the sea beast, remained silent. His hulking scaled form dwarfed the others. He listened and watched, endlessly calculating, scheming to gain dominion over all. Subtlety was his art, not wasted words.

And so they argued and fought, each attempting to gain an advantage through force or cunning. But in the end, their ambitions were too evenly matched. Exhausted, they withdrew to their domains to build their power and one day renew their claims.

The empty throne of Hell remained empty, waiting for one clever or mighty enough to claim it once and for all. The master of Hell had not yet returned or been replaced. The Devil remained unnamed. And the world continued on, oblivious to the infernal war that was yet to come.
