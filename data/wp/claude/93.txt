The Apple Lesson 

Timmy was a curious eight-year-old. He was fascinated by the red, round apple sitting on the kitchen counter. He knew apples were delicious, sweet fruits, but he realized he didn't actually know how to properly eat one. He decided today was the day he would learn.

Timmy picked up the apple and washed it off. He held it in his small hands, feeling its smooth skin and firm shape. He twisted and turned it, looking at it from all angles. 

His mom walked by and saw him examining the apple. "Is everything okay?" she asked. Timmy explained that he wanted to learn the right way to eat an apple. His mom smiled and said, "Well, first take a bite. Go slow—there's no rush."

Timmy sunk his teeth into the apple, the crispness breaking with a satisfying snap. The sweet juice filled his mouth as he chewed the piece. "It's so fresh!" he exclaimed. His mom laughed. "Fresh apples from the orchard are the best."

Timmy took another bite, and another. Soon he had eaten everything but the core. As he finished, he suddenly had a thought. "Mom, can we plant the seeds from this apple?"  His mom thought that was a wonderful idea. They planted the seeds in pots of soil and put them by a sunny window.  

A few days later, Timmy saw a small green sprout emerge from one of the pots. His little seedling was growing! Learning about the life inside that apple—and now seeing the start of a new life from what was left over—made Timmy appreciate the fruit even more. 

All from taking the time to learn how to properly eat an apple. Timmy realized an apple could teach him so much more than just how delicious it was. It also taught him about patience, nurturing new life and the wonders of nature. He would never look at an apple the same way again.
