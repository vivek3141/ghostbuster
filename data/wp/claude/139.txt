The Kingdom of Hide and Seek

The old oak tree loomed over the quiet kingdom. Beneath its branches, a group of small children played in the village square as the sun began to set. 

"Who wants to play a game?" asked Jenny, a young girl with messy pigtails. The other children cheered in agreement.

"Let's play hide and seek!" suggested Timmy, a boy in a tattered tunic. "I'll be the seeker. Everyone go hide!"

The children dispersed, giggling with excitement. Timmy smiled and began counting. "One, two, three..."

Jenny ran down a winding dirt path away from the village. She came upon a dense forest and wandered between the thick trunks, looking for the perfect hiding spot. In the fading light, she spotted an old abandoned wagon and crawled underneath. 

Meanwhile, Timmy finished counting. "Ready or not, here I come!" He checked behind the large water well in the square, then the stables, but couldn't find anyone. He ventured into the forest. 

As darkness fell, Timmy grew worried. He had found all the other children except Jenny. "Jenny! Come out, I give up!" But only silence came from the forest.

Jenny awoke with a start. She had fallen asleep under the wagon, but now she was alone in the pitch black forest. She began crying, terrified of never finding her way home. 

Timmy ran to get help from the village guard. "Jenny is lost in the forest! We have to find her!" The guard summoned the other guards, and they set off with torches into the forest. 

After searching for hours, Jenny was about to lose hope when she spotted a torchlight in the distance. "Help! I'm over here!" she called out.

The guard rushed over, relieved to find the missing girl. "We've been so worried! Your parents will be glad to have you home." He escorted Jenny out of the forest and back to her village, where her parents embraced her tightly.  

Jenny smiled, her fear fading away in her parents' arms. Timmy approached, his head hung low.  "I'm sorry I couldn't find you. I didn't mean for you to get lost."

Jenny gave Timmy a quick hug. "Don't worry. No game of hide and seek will ever be as exciting as this one!" The children laughed, their friendship as strong as ever. And the old oak tree stood silent watch over the village once more.
