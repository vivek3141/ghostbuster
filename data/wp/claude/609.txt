The old time machine sat in the corner of my garage, covered in years of dust. I had obtained it from a mysterious stranger who warned me that using it came with a cost - for every year traveled, I would age either forwards or backwards. I knew if I used it, there would be no going back. 

Yet my curiosity got the better of me. There were so many eras I wanted to visit. The Wild West. Ancient Rome. The Jurassic period. My adventurous spirit craved adventure and the unknown.

I decided to start small for my first trip. I entered the date for 10 years into the future and activated the machine. There was a bright flash and the garage disappeared. I emerged in a meadow, the time machine door creaking open. To my shock, my hands looked 10 years older. It worked. I had aged.

Over the next few weeks, I took more trips, visiting the major time periods I had always dreamed of. Each time the aging effect happened in one direction or the other. I grew older visiting the future, younger visiting the past. I kept careful records of each trip to minimize the impact.

On my 10th trip, I decided to visit the Jurassic period, something I had always wanted to see with my own eyes. I entered the date 150 million years in the past and braced myself for either aging backwards into nonexistence or becoming an old man.

There was the familiar flash and the time machine appeared in a dense jungle. The door opened and I peered out with trepidation. To my relief, I seemed unchanged. I had landed at a point where the aging effects precisely balanced out. 

A loud roar shook the jungle, followed by heavy footfalls. Through the brush, I glimpsed a towering Brachiosaurus, with two Parasaurolophus following close behind. My heart swelled at the sight of real life dinosaurs. I had made it. My dream came true.

I spent a week in the Jurassic period, observing the wonders of this prehistoric world. While saddened to leave it behind, I returned home, having satiated my thirst for adventure. The time machine would take no more trips. I had found my perfect balance in the Jurassic, aging not a day for a week that lasted an eternity. My curiosity was satisfied, and now I was content to stay in the present, having lived and witnessed more than any human in history.
