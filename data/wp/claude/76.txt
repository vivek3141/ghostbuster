The mud sucked at Varrick's boots as he trudged through the trench. Cold, wet mud that had been churned up by thousands of feet and stained red with blood over the long months of the siege of Blackstone. 

Varrick clutched his rifle, his knuckles white. His breath misted in the chill pre-dawn air. All around him, soldiers from a dozen kingdoms huddled in their trenches, waiting.

In the distance, the Iron Realm's factories belched smoke and flame. The industrial might of that realm had been turned to the war, creating terrible new weapons to hurl at the Allied kingdoms defending Blackstone. Weapons like the land dreadnoughts, massive armored vehicles bristling with cannons and machine guns that crawled across no man's land on tracks. Or the feared iron dragons, zeppelins that rained death from the skies.

But the Allies had magic and mythical beasts of their own to call upon. As the first glow of the sun peaked over the horizon, a roar shook the very air. Varrick looked up to see a flight of gryphons descending from the Allied camp, each bearing a wizard or sorceress. As they flew over the trench, the spellcasters hurled glowing balls of fire and lightning bolts at the Iron Realm's lines. 

A few moments later, a series of massive explosions erupted amid the smoke and flame, signaling the destruction of several dreadnoughts caught exposed. A cheer went up from the Allied troops, but it soon turned to cries of fear.

From the Iron lines rose a trio of iron dragons, spitting tracer fire and bombs. One gryphon erupted into flame, but the others scattered. A dragon gave chase, hunting more prey.

"Look sharp, here they come!" an officer barked. As if in answer, a shrieking whistle sounded and the ground shook as enemy artillery began to pound the Allied trenches. Magefire and mana shields crackled to life overhead, intercepting some of the incoming shells. But for every one blocked, another found its mark, bursting in a shower of mud and blood.

The whistles shrieked again, and this time a rolling thunder came in answer. A force of dreadnoughts was advancing, tracks churning, guns blazing. "Take aim!" Varrick's captain ordered. "Fire at will!"

Varrick aimed and pulled the trigger, the crack of gunfire mixing with the thunder of the dreadnoughts and the screams of men. His rifle bucked in his hands as he fired again and again. Around him, others did the same. Mages hurled spells and the beastmasters directed their creatures to attack. 

A dreadnought exploded, then another. But still they came, implacable as death itself. Varrick loaded another clip, took aim at a gunner exposed in a hatch and fired. The man fell, but more took his place. 

With a ground-shaking crash, the first dreadnought reached the Allied trench. Its cannons swung around and opened fire, shredding flesh and earth alike. "Fall back!"

Varrick turned and ran as hell erupted around him. Men fell, or were tossed into the air like rag dolls. The screams of the dying and the grinding of gears mixed with the keening whistle of shells and the roar of dragons.

Blackstone would fall today. But they would make the invaders pay for every inch in blood and iron. Varrick bared his teeth in a defiant snarl. The war was not over. As long as even one Allied soldier still stood, there was hope. The kingdoms would endure.
