The dusty highway stretched out under the blazing sun, not a car in sight. Jack sighed, sweat pouring down his face as he trudged along the shoulder, backpack straining his shoulders. He figured it had been two hours since the last vehicle flew by without even slowing down. His patience was wearing thin.  

In the distance, Jack saw a lone SUV approaching. He stuck out his thumb, hoping this one would stop. As it got closer, the SUV slowed and pulled onto the shoulder ahead of him. The tinted window rolled down, revealing a smiling face.

"Need a lift?" asked the driver. He looked friendly enough. Looked like a dad on vacation.  

"That would be amazing, thanks so much," said Jack, tossing his bag into the backseat. He slid into the cool air conditioning, breathing a sigh of relief.  

"Where you headed?" asked the driver, easing back onto the road.

"Just the next town up ahead will do fine," said Jack. "I really appreciate you stopping."

"No problem at all!" said the driver cheerfully. "I'm always happy to help out folks in need."

They made casual small talk as the SUV cruised down the empty highway under a clear blue sky. The driver's pleasant demeanor and kindly smile put Jack at ease. Not every hitchhiker got so lucky—you never knew what kind of psycho might stop and pick you up. 

After a few miles, Jack noticed they seemed to have passed the exit for the next town. He checked the signs they were passing, searching for familiar route numbers. Nothing looked right.

"Sorry, think we missed the exit for the town I wanted back there," Jack said.  

The driver's smile flickered. "Did we now? My apologies, I must have been distracted. Let me turn us around at the next exit and get you back on track."

But at the next exit, the driver showed no signs of turning off. He gripped the wheel tightly, still smiling. Jack squirmed in his seat, dread pooling in the pit of his stomach.  

"I really need to get to that town," he insisted, forcing a light, casual tone. "If you could just turn around at the next opportunity..."  

"I'm afraid I can't do that," said the driver in a voice like ice. His smile vanished, replaced by a chilling blankness. "You and I are taking a little detour."

 Jack's heart pounded as he frantically tried to assess the situation. This day had taken a dangerous turn. He was trapped in a moving vehicle with a psycho at the wheel, headed to god knows where. 

. . .

The SUV bumped and swayed down the dirt road, hemmed in by thick forest on both sides. Jack could see no signs of civilization out here. His captor hadn't said a word in over an hour. The chilling smile had returned to his lips as he drove further into the wilderness.  

Finally the SUV emerged into a clearing, a sprawling yard surrounding a weathered farmhouse. "We're here!" said the driver brightly, as if they'd just arrived at their vacation destination. 

He slid out from behind the wheel and came around to open Jack's door. Jack stumbled out onto the ground. His legs felt numb.  The driver grabbed him firmly by the arm and hauled him toward a pair of cellar doors, throwing them open to reveal a pitch-black abyss.

"After you," he said, shoving Jack forward. His polite tone and kindly demeanor were gone now. Jack started down the stairs, slowly, blindly, as his captor followed behind. The doors slammed shut overhead, sealing them in shadow.  

At the bottom, the driver flicked on a dim lightbulb. The steps had led down into a bare concrete room. Jack blinked at the sudden light, then felt his throat tighten at the sight before him. Shackles and chains hung from the walls. Blood stains splattered the floor.  

In the far corner, a gagged person was strapped to a chair. They thrashed and tried to scream behind the gag upon seeing Jack arrive. 

Jack wheeled around to face his captor. The psycho smiled gleefully at him, no kindness left in those eyes. "Today is your lucky day!” he exclaimed, brandishing a bloodied knife. “Two for the price of one. My favorite kind of sale..."

Jack swallowed hard. For the first time, he regretted sticking out his thumb and hitching that ride.
