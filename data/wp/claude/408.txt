I took a deep breath and steeled myself for what was to come. As Sergeant of the Alpha Squad, I had just given the order to pull back from defending the bridge. It was an impossible fight, and staying would mean certain death for all my soldiers. 

But as I turned around, I was faced with five rifle barrels pointed at my face. My own squad, my loyal soldiers who I had led through hell and back, were now turning their weapons on me.

“Stand down!” I bellowed. But they did not waver.

“We don't abandon our posts!” yelled Jax, always the most bullheaded of the group. I saw the anger and betrayal in his eyes.

“Stand down, that's an order!” I repeated. But it was clear words were not going to solve this problem. I had two choices. Follow my order and pull back, avoiding a slaughter but destroying the trust of my squad. Or stand and fight, ending in our pointless demise but upholding our honor. As leaders, we make hard choices. But this was shaping up to be the hardest of my life.

I looked into each of their eyes, one by one. Jax’s anger, Rika’s disappointment, Noah's confusion. I had led these soldiers into battle after battle, celebrated victories and mourned losses side by side. They were more than subordinates. They were family. 

I threw my rifle to the ground. “If this is what needs to happen, do it. I don't abandon my squad. We stand together, or we die together.”

For a moment no one moved. Then Rika was the first to lower her rifle. “He's right. We're a team.”

“To the end,” said Noah, following suit. 

Jax was the last to stand down, his eyes still smoldering. But his loyalty to the squad was more important than any order. He gave me a curt nod.

“Move out!” I yelled, picking up my rifle again. The squad fell into position behind me without question. We would make our final stand, outnumbered and overrun, but as a unit. A family. This was the life we had chosen, and the true meaning of honor. If today the tasks were hard and choices harder, we would face it all together. Sergeant and squad, bonded until the end.
