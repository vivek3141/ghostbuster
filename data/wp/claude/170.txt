I was tired of those meddling kids foiling my plans. Every scheme I came up with, no matter how clever, inevitably ended with them pulling off my mask and revealing me as the "villain of the week." Not this time. I was determined to be the first villain to outsmart Mystery Inc. 

I set my sights on the old abandoned amusement park on the edge of town. According to legend, the owner had hidden a chest of gold coins somewhere in the park before disappearing. If I could find it, I'd be rich. And if I could scare off anyone else looking for it in the process, even better.

In the dead of night, I broke into the old prop warehouse and gathered everything I'd need. A spooky ghost costume, a fog machine, speakers to play eerie sounds and music. I rigged up the whole park with traps and tricks to frighten intruders. Now all I had to do was wait.

A couple nights later, right on schedule, the Mystery Machine rolled up to the front gate. I watched on my hidden cameras as Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby entered the park. Time to put on a show. 

I blasted fog and creepy organ music as they explored. Swinging axes and sliding panels with skeletons popped out. Shaggy and Scooby were scared out of their wits, but the others pushed on. Just as they were about to give up, I projected a giant holographic ghost that glided through the air. "Leave this place or face my wrath!" Its hollow voice boomed.

They ran out of the park and straight to the police, just as I had hoped. By the time the authorities searched the place with spotlights, I had already recovered the gold and covered my tracks. The fog had faded, the music was silenced, the traps were sprung harmlessly. Without evidence the ghost was real, Mystery Inc had no mystery to solve. 

And so I became the first villain to evade capture from those meddling kids. The legend of the haunted amusement park lived on, keeping trespassers and treasure hunters away from my secret gold. Outsmarting Mystery Inc was satisfying enough, but the riches were a sweet bonus. Scooby Doo and his friends may have solved their last case. This villain had finally won.
