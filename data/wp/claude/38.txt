The End of Days 

I peered through the slats of the abandoned warehouse, looking for any signs of life. The streets were eerily quiet. It had only been a few months since the announcement, and already most of humanity had been transformed.

When the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage worldwide, conservatives warned it would undermine society. We laughed them off. But soon after, people started 'turning' gay in droves, as if infected by a virus. First it was isolated cases, then celebrities came out, then politicians. Within weeks, most of my friends and family had converted. They tried to convince me too, saying how happy and liberated they felt. But I knew something was wrong. This was not natural. 

Those of us who remained fled to secret enclaves. We were the last survivors clinging to normalcy in a world gone mad. Scavenging for food and supplies was dangerous, as the converted vastly outnumbered us, and searched relentlessly for resisters. Their rainbow pride parades stretched as far as the eye could see. 

I missed my old friends and family, but knew they were gone. Whatever this thing was that had control of them, it was winning. Our kind would soon be extinct.

As dusk fell, I prepared to venture out again. But then I heard a faint knocking at the barricaded door. "Let me in!", a hushed voice pleaded. My heart raced. Could it be a survivor? I unlatched the door to find my ex-girlfriend, bedraggled but still normal. She leapt into my arms, sobbing.

"The city has fallen. I'm the last unconverted soul there. We have to flee!", she gasped.

I took her hand and we disappeared into the night, the future uncertain but together we still had hope. The end was nigh, yet all was not yet lost.
