I slowly opened my eyes as Jake dragged my limp body into the forest behind his house. I had to remain completely still while he carried me, despite the excruciating pain in my ribs where his crowbar had made contact.

Jake had been my best friend for as long as I could remember. We grew up together, went to the same schools, and were as close as brothers. Which is why I couldn't understand why he had attacked me in his garage, a crazed look in his eyes. The blow had knocked the wind out of me, but I had instinctively played dead to avoid further injury. 

Now as Jake disposed of my 'body,' I tried to make sense of what had happened. We didn't have any arguments recently. In fact, we had just seen a movie together the night before, same as always. There were no signs that Jake wanted to hurt me. So why did he snap?

After Jake had left, I dragged myself out of the bushes and managed to get home unseen. My parents were shocked at my appearance and rushed me to the hospital. I told them I had been mugged by a stranger, not wanting to reveal that my best friend had done this to me. 

A week later, I was recovered enough to venture out and made my way to Jake's house when I knew he would be out. I searched everywhere for some clue, finally finding a diary hidden in his mattress. With trembling hands, I read the disturbing truth.

Jake had become increasingly obsessed with a girl from our school named Amanda. But when he saw us talking and laughing together a couple weeks ago, his mind had spun out of control with jealousy and rage. Convincing himself that I was somehow manipulating Amanda to fall for me instead of him, Jake's affection for me had turned into a homicidal darkness. 

I went to the police with the diary, not only ensuring Jake would face justice, but also realizing I had lost my closest friend forever. His love for Amanda had twisted him into someone I didn't recognize, capable of attempted murder due to his own imagined betrayals and resentments. I escaped with my life, but the scars of that night in the garage would haunt me for years to come.
