God sighed as the holographic display in front of him flashed red once again. Another galaxy in crisis, billions of lives at stake. He focused his consciousness into that faraway realm  and got to work stabilizing their sun before it went supernova, redirecting asteroids that threatened inhabited worlds, adjusting planetary orbits ever so slightly. 

It had been 750 years since God last had a spare moment to check in on the Milky Way galaxy. As an eternal, omnipotent being, time held little meaning. But God did feel a twinge of guilt at neglecting his creations, even if just for the blink of a cosmic eye.

With the crisis averted for now in that distant galaxy, God returned his consciousness to the control center of all existence. He gazed at the hologram showing the Milky Way, teeming with celestial bodies, nebulae, black holes - and life. So much life. His life. 

God opened his senses to Earth, a world he had seeded with the precursors to human beings on one of his early creative sprees. Now home to 7 billion souls, each as multifaceted as a diamond. He was surprised to find the beings had made tremendous progress in his absence. Such creativity, passion, and morality - but also darkness, destruction, and suffering. 

As God's presence filled the sphere of Earth, many sensed his return - a rush of inexplicable peace, joy or clarity. A child in a remote village smiled as colorful shapes danced at the edge of her vision. A renowned physicist suddenly grasped the solution to an intractable problem, scribbling madly at a chalkboard. Two world leaders at an impasse both felt the urge to understand the other's perspective.

God knew he should leave the humans to chart their own course, for better and worse. His place was tackling cosmic catastrophes, creating new worlds, overseeing the infinite. 

But for the briefest of moments, as God gazed with equal parts pride and sorrow upon the Earth, he sent a pulse of grace and wisdom out into the ether. It rippled across the planet, touching every mind with a single thought: "You are my creation, you are loved, and you will never be forsaken."

Before the thought could fully register in the minds and hearts of humanity, God had already turned away from Earth once more. The hologram blinked back to the crisis in the distant galaxy, demanding God's full attention. His work was never done. The Earth would continue turning without his watchful eye, as all worlds must do.
