I have so much to say, but no voice to say it. The words swirl in my mind, an endless stream of thoughts, observations, jokes, questions. But they remain trapped inside, caged by a body that won't cooperate.

Every day I see people open their mouths and let their words flow out easily. They chat, laugh, argue, whisper. For them, speech is simple, natural. For me, it's an impossibility. I was born with a condition that stripped me of my ability to talk. While my brain understands language completely, it can't figure out a way to translate those thoughts into the complex series of movements required to produce speech. 

Most of the time I don't feel too bothered by my enforced silence. I've learned other ways to communicate, and the people closest to me have learned to understand me, even without words. I live a full, happy life surrounded by people who love me. But there are still moments when the weight of all those trapped words comes crashing down on me. So many thoughts that I wish I could just blurt out, but can't. Jokes I know would make people laugh. Questions I desperately want to ask. Stories I want to share. In those moments, my silent curse feels unbearable. 

Sitting alone at the coffee shop, watching people casually chat and joke around with the barista, I feel that familiar frustration rise within me. I smile and nod politely at the barista, pointing to the drink I want, as always. She's come to recognize me and has my order ready, for which I'm grateful. But as she hands it over with a friendly "Have a great day!" part of me wants to respond, to say something, anything back to her. But my treacherous mouth remains sealed shut. I can do nothing but nod and smile again, hoping my appreciation shows through. 

Finding a table in the corner, I settle in to do some work, laptop open. But my attention keeps drifting to the easy back-and-forth of conversation flowing around me. Two older men, laughing heartily at some joke one just told. A group of students passionately debating some topic from their studies. A young couple whispering and giggling, completely enthralled in their blossoming romance. All these people effortlessly using their voices to connect, to share their humor or knowledge or affection.

I try to concentrate on my work, but feel utterly alone in this sea of chatter. My solitude is self-imposed and inescapable. I'll never fully be part of this world where speech is just another casual human function for so many. But still, I long for even one sip of easy conversation. To make just one offhand comment to a friendly stranger. Or tell a silly joke that makes someone else burst into surprised laughter. My inner voice cries out for a connection that my physical voice will never allow.  And so I sit, trapped behind my silence, and listen.
