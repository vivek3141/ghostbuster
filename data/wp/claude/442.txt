The old abandoned house loomed over the hill, dark and foreboding against the gray sky. Mark knew it was foolish to go inside, but he was determined to prove to his friends that he wasn't afraid. 

"I bet you can't last five minutes in there," taunted his friend Mike. The others snickered.

Mark steeled himself. "Watch me."

He walked up the creaking steps and pushed open the front door. It swung inward with a groan. Shadows flickered and danced in the dim light filtering through grimy windows. A thick layer of dust coated the floor and discernible footprints were his own.

Moving slowly forward, Mark entered what was once a living room. An ancient sofa sagged in the corner, stuffing pouring from large tears in the upholstery. A rusted metal chandelier hung at a precarious angle from the ceiling, most of its candles long melted away. 

A narrow hallway led into darkness. As Mark's eyes adjusted, he began to make out shapes: a broken table with chairs askew; a cabinet with glass doors as opaque as obsidian; rows of framed pictures on the wall, the photos behind the glass obscured beyond recognition. 

His heart began to race but he ventured down the hall, floorboards shrieking in protest under his feet. Doors lined both sides, most closed. The first opened into a kitchen where shattered plates and glasses littered the floor and cobwebs filled the corners. Mark blinked and for a moment could almost see the spectral outline of a woman standing at the sink, but when he looked again it was gone.

The next room was set up like a small classroom, wooden desks decomposing under a thick blanket of rot. An antique globe sat on the teacher's desk, continents faded into indistinction. Mark felt as though he was being watched, but each time he turned swiftly no one was there.

At the end of the hall was a narrow door, slightly ajar. A feeling of deep unease settled into Mark's stomach. Whatever was behind that door, he knew he didn't want to see it. His curiosity warred with his fear, and ultimately fear won out. 

Mark scrambled back down the hallway, each step faster than the last, and burst out of the front door. His friends turned in surprise at his hurried exit. 

"Told you he couldn't last long," Mike said with a sneer. 

Mark said nothing as his heart pounded in his chest. He cast one last, frightened glance at the house that loomed like a beast over its domain before following his friends down the hill. After today he would give the old abandoned house a wide berth, and he would never again let his friends goad him into going somewhere that felt so deeply wrong.
