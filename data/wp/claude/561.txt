The closet door rattled as I got dressed for bed. Strange, I thought. I opened the door but everything looked normal. My shirts and dresses hung undisturbed, shoes lined up neatly on the floor. 

As I closed the door, a piece of paper on the floor caught my eye. A note had been slipped under the door. I unfolded it to find a message scrawled in jagged letters:

STAY AWAY. 

My heart jumped. Stay away from what? I spun around to survey my room but saw nothing amiss. Everything was in order.

I turned back to the closet. What was in there that I needed to stay away from? I inched the door open slowly, holding my breath. The dim light from the room filtered in, casting shadows between the hanging clothes. But other than my normal wardrobe, I detected nothing unusual.

My cat meowed from the doorway, breaking the tension, and I laughed nervously. It seemed I had worked myself up over what was likely a prank. One of my roommates having a laugh, perhaps. I changed into my pajamas and climbed into bed, mystery unsolved but content to leave it alone until morning.

In the dark, my eyes caught a faint glow coming from the gap under the closet door. I froze in place, heart pounding again. The glow grew brighter, as if something inside was emitting light. But what, and how? I stared in disbelief at the eerie illumination.

The door rattled again as something slammed against the other side. The note's warning echoed in my mind: STAY AWAY. But now a more sinister message seemed clear—stay away from the closet. I scrambled out of bed, grabbing only my phone, and rushed out of the room as a sharp, acrid smell like sulfur wafted from under the door. I dialed 911 with trembling fingers and shouted, “Help is coming, but whatever you are—just stay in the closet!”
