My gift was meant to heal, yet it led only to ruin. With but a touch, I could mend broken bones, cure diseases, and even reverse aging. At first, I used this power for good—healing the sick and giving the lame their lives back. But word spread of my ability, and crowds began to gather outside my home, desperate for my miraculous touch. 

In the chaos, a young boy was trampled to death as people vied to reach me. His death weighed heavily upon my soul. I realized then my power could never bring true peace. The human lust for immortality and escape from suffering would only breed more chaos and conflict.

And so I withdrew from the world. But humanity's greed would not be so easily denied. Leaders and oligarchs dispatched agents to find me and bend my power to their will. When their entreaties failed, they turned to force. I was kidnapped, imprisoned, even tortured to try and coerce me to heal and grant longevity to the highest bidder.

I escaped my captors and went into hiding, but their relentless pursuit knew no bounds. I had but one weapon to defend myself—my power to heal. And so I began to use it to harm instead. With a single touch, I could rapidly age a man into dust and brittle bones. I could inflict diseases that would fell even the mightiest in a matter of days. My curse became my protection, and I evolved into the villain they made me. Pursued by many, in service to none, with but a single superpower that brought only death. My name is both revered and feared across kingdoms. I am the World Blight.
