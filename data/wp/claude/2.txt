I was feckin' sloshed, mate. First time I ever was in the Big Lemon, and I'd found me the best feckin' pub I could imagine, I tell ya what. So I stumble out when it was closin' time, musta been'round 4 o'clock in the morning, and made my way through some alleys to find the quaint little AirBnB place I'd rented for the week.  

The cobblestone streets were like an obstacle course to my blurred vision and unsteady feet. I lurched left, then right, grasping at the old brick walls to keep from toppling over. The pale yellow light of the streetlamps glowed fuzzy and indistinct. I blinked hard, trying to bring the world into some semblance of focus and figure out which twisting alley I had wandered into.  

Nothing looked familiar. Panic started to rise in my throat, choking out the laughter that had filled me just moments before. I was lost, drunk as a skunk, wandering the ancient streets of a city I barely knew. My mates had left hours ago, either off with some woman or stumbling back to their own temporary abodes. I was alone.

The realization sobered me a bit. I leaned against a wall, dragging in deep breaths of the cool night air and willing my brain to start working properly again. Think man, think! I came down that street there, took a left, then...or was it two lefts? 

As a wave of nausea threatened to overcome me, a light flickered on in a third-story window above, illuminating a painted blue door across the way. The blue door! I stumbled across the alley and pounded on it, hoping the little old lady I had rented from still had her hearing. 

After a few moments that seemed an eternity, the door creaked open. My landlady peered out, candle in hand, her gray hair in curlers under a hairnet and a tartan bathrobe wrapped tight around her. 

"Do you have any idea what time it is, young man?" she squawked in a thick Scottish brogue. 

"I do apologize, ma'am, " I stammered, leaning heavily on the door frame, "but I seem to have gotten myself turned around and couldn't find my way home."

She shook her head, mumbling under her breath about drunken tourists as she opened the door to let me in. As she led me to the stairs that would take me up to my room and my bed, I promised myself I would never let a Big Lemon get the better of me again. Some lessons you have to learn the hard way.
