The sanitation crews worked tirelessly, scrubbing down public spaces to combat the spread. Everyone wore masks and avoided close contact, worried the depression might spread through airborne transmission or physical touch. 

Jenny hadn't left her apartment in weeks. She couldn't risk exposure to the anxiety that was ravaging her city. News reports warned that obsessive compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder were on the rise and spreading fast. 

Her food rations were running low but she didn't feel safe going to the distribution center. What if she caught schizophrenia or bipolar disorder? She might never feel normal again.

A knock at the door startled Jenny from her worried trance.  She peered through the peephole to see her friend Sam, mask on and gloves up.  "Jenny please, you need to come out. The paranoia is taking over the city and people are starting to panic."

Jenny shook her head. "I can't Sam. It's not safe. The disorders are everywhere!"  

Sam frowned with sympathy.  "The only disorder spreading is fear and misinformation.  The officials now say that mental health conditions can't be transmitted that way.  Anxiety and depression can't survive on surfaces or in the air.  It's all a hysteria that got out of control.  Please, come out.  The city needs to heal and we need to support each other through this trauma."

Jenny waivered, longing for connection but still fearful of the unknown.  Summoning her courage, she slowly opened the door.  Sam embraced her with tears of relief.   The road ahead was long, but together they would overcome the real disorder plaguing their city - ignorance and fear.  Step by step, they would spread the truth and share comfort, easing troubled minds and calming rattled nerves.  The city would heal, as long as people came together.
