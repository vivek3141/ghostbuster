The Gift and The Curse 

You were born with a strange gift, or perhaps it was a curse. For as long as you can remember, whenever you met someone new, you would get a vision of how they would die. Not when, just how. As a child, these visions terrified you. You saw a neighbor dying peacefully in a hospital bed. A classmate perishing in a car accident. A teacher collapsing from a sudden heart attack.

You learned not to tell anyone about these morbid premonitions. They wouldn't understand, and would likely just dismiss them as a child's overactive imagination. But you knew they were real. As you grew up, you trained yourself to hide any reaction you might have to these visions. You didn't want to alarm the subjects of them or attract any attention. 

In your teens, you rebelled against this bizarre ability. You didn't want to know how everyone you knew was fated to perish. You wished you could trade this "gift" for something normal and useful. But still the visions came, as unwanted and unstoppable as ever.

As an adult, you learned to live with this part of yourself, strange as it was. There was nothing you could do to change it. The knowledge of others' ends still saddened you, but you found some solace knowing that at least you could provide comfort to friends and loved ones in their final days when the time came.

One day, you met a dazzling stranger and felt the familiar tug of a vision taking hold. But this time, instead of seeing a disturbing demise, you saw a joyful scene: the two of you embracing warmly as elderly but still energized people. You realized with a start that you'd seen your own deathâ€”and that you and this fascinating new person in front of you seemingly had a long, happy life ahead together first. 

Your "curse" had revealed a blessing. And in that moment, you felt profoundly grateful for the gift you'd been given, strange and imperfect though it was. At long last, you had been given a glimpse of hope.
