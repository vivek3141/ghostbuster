The Interrogator stalked into the dimly lit room, his heavy boots thudding on the concrete floor. His latest mark was tied to a wooden chair in the center of the room, bathed in the glow of a single hanging bulb. 

"I hear you're down to your last word, Mr. Smith," The Interrogator growled, circling like a shark. "I've been paid a lot of money to get you talking before that word leaves your lips. My methods can be quite...persuasive."

Mr. Smith set his jaw and stared straight ahead in defiance. His eyes flickered to The Interrogator's instruments lying on a table in the corner - pliers, knives, matches, hammer. Tools of The Interrogator's gruesome trade.

The Interrogator grabbed Mr. Smith's hand and twisted his finger back, snapping the bone. Mr. Smith screamed. 

"There goes one word," The Interrogator said. "About 97,365 to go. Now, tell me the passcode for the safe, or I start breaking other bits."

"No," Mr. Smith panted. More fingers were shattered. More screams. More words lost.

The Interrogator was impressed by Mr. Smith's resolve. Most gave up the information within the first hundred words or so. But Mr. Smith was holding out, keeping his secret, even as The Interrogator systematically destroyed his hands.

Finally, Mr. Smith slumped in the chair, his mangled hands leaking blood onto the floor. His breath came in short, ragged gasps. The Interrogator leaned in close.

"Are you ready to talk yet, Mr. Smith?" The Interrogator whispered. "You can't have more than 40 or 50 words left in you, by my count."

Mr. Smith lifted his head. His eyes burned with a inner fire fueled by anger and pain. He worked his ruined jaw, summoning the energy for speech. The Interrogator smiled, anticipating his victory as Mr. Smith's last words slipped out...

Mr. Smith looked The Interrogator dead in the eye. "Go to hell," he spat, his bloody teeth gleaming in the dim light.

Those two words were his last. Mr. Smith slumped over in the chair, dead, taking his secret to the grave.

The Interrogator roared in frustration and swept his instruments off the table with a crash. He had been outwitted, for the first time, by a mark with just one word left to live. His reputation as the mob's most feared man shattered, like Smith's broken hands. The word 'go' echoed in his mind, over and over, marking his first and bitter failure.
