The bitter betrayal. 

I walked into the familiar green and white building, the mermaid logo offering a promise of sweet escape. My usual order danced on the tip of my tongue, waiting to be spoken to the cheerful barista. Caffè Vanilla Light Frappuccino with nonfat milk. My one indulgence, the only treat I allowed myself in my spartan regimen of discipline. A reward I had earned through hours of sweat and toil.

The barista smiled at me, the usual one, her brown eyes twinkling with recognition. "One Caffè Vanilla Light Frappuccino with nonfat milk coming right up!" I paid and moved down to await my drink, already tasting the familiar swirl of coffee and vanilla on my tongue. 

A few minutes later, she called my name and set down the cup on the counter. I grasped the cup, chilled to the perfect temperature, and took a long thirsty sip. But something was horribly wrong. My mouth was filled with a sickly sweet assault of chocolate and fat, cellophane-thick. I looked up at the barista in dismay and confusion. 

"I'm so sorry," she said, her eyes stricken. "I accidentally made you a Double Chocolaty Chip Crème Frappuccino by mistake. I can make you a new one right away."

But the damage was done. My treat was ruined. My one little reprieve now a caloric minefield set to explode across my hips. I blinked back hot tears of regret and betrayal, unable to form a coherent reply. 

She called after me but I hurried out of the door, the toxic cup clutched in my hands. With each step a chocolatey tear slid down my cheek, as I mourned the loss of my Vanilla dream. The betrayal of the mermaid had undone me today. My joy had been snatched from my lips with one accidental slip of the baristas hands. The bitterness of chocolate would haunt me for days to come.
