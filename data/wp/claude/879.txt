The old warehouse loomed before him, holding memories too painful to recall but impossible to forget. He walked through the creaky door into the dusty light, each step heavier than the last. In the center of the room sat a lone chair, a single beam of light illuminating its faded upholstery.  

He sat down slowly and closed his eyes, transported back in time. He could smell her perfume, hear her laughter echoing in the rafters. They had been so happy here, hidden away from the world and all its problems.

A tear slid down his cheek as he remembered the heartbreak, the crushing moment when she told him she was leaving and never coming back. The light in her eyes extinguished, her smile turned cold. She walked out the door without a glance behind.

The light in the warehouse flickered as if shaking him from his reverie. He opened his eyes again, returning to the present. The past could not be changed, as much as he wished for it. He took a deep breath and stood up, his legs stiff.  

As he walked to the door, the memories fading with each step, a small glimmer caught his eye. There, carved faintly in the wood were two letters entwined: an M and an E. A bittersweet smile crossed his lips.  

The past would always remain, but now it no longer haunted him. He could remember the joy and not just the pain. His heart stirred, no longer frozen by bitter regret,as he traced the carving one last time before closing the door.
