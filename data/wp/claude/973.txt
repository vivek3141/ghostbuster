The dinner crowd at Denny's had thinned out, leaving only a few customers in the booths along the edge of the dining room.  Maggie refilled a coffee for an elderly couple in the corner and checked that the man at the counter didn't need anything else before slipping into the back to grab a rag to wipe down some recently vacated tables. 

As she emerged from the kitchen, she saw the man at the counter peering into an open briefcase on the stool next to him.  His meal sat untouched in front of him.  Strange, she thought.  She walked over and cheerfully asked, "Is everything okay with your food, sir?"

The man glanced up at her and snapped the briefcase shut.  "It's fine.  I told you I wanted to be left alone while I ate.  Why are you harassing me?" His eyes were bloodshot and his hands fidgety.  Maggie's smile faded.  Something seemed very off.  

"I apologize, I was just checking to see if you needed anything else.  I'll leave you alone now," she said softly, turning to go wipe the empty tables as she said she would.  

"Stop right there," the man commanded.  Maggie froze in place, her back to the man.  Her heart began to race as she heard a distinctive click from behind her.  

The man spoke again, his voice wavering, "Turn around.  Slowly."

Maggie turned to face the man.  He had moved from the counter to a nearby booth, briefcase in hand, pointing a handgun directly at her.  The few remaining customers gasped and froze in place, uncertain of what was unfolding before them.

"Please sir, there's no need for the gun.  How can I help you?" Maggie asked, fighting to keep her voice steady.  

The man gestured at his full plate with the gun.  "This is not what I ordered.  I ordered an omelette, not a burger.  How incompetent are you people?"  

Maggie blinked in confusion.  "I apologize for the mistake, but I did not take your order.  I can have the kitchen make you a fresh omelette right away."  

The man glared at her, his hands shaking and finger tense on the trigger.  After a long, terrifying moment, he dropped his arm and returned the gun to his briefcase.  "Forget it.  I have to go."  He tossed a $20 bill on the table and stalked out of the restaurant, leaving his untouched meal and a stunned silence behind him.
