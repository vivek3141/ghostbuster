Death glided into the small cottage, his dark cloak brushing the doorframe. The old man was waiting in his usual spot by the fire. 

"Ah, my friend, please sit." The man gestured to the empty rocking chair.

Death sighed and sat. His bony fingers gripped his scythe. After so many weekly chats over tea, how could he tell the man this was the end?

The man peered at Death. "You seem distant. What troubles you?"

Death hesitated. The man deserved the truth. "My friend, I have come not just to chat but to collect you. Your time has come."

The man nodded slowly, absorbing the news with grace and wisdom gained over nine decades of life experiences. "I see. I hoped for a few more sunrises, but I cannot complain about the time I've had." He smiled at Death. "Will it hurt?" 

"No, I promise you will feel peaceful. And I will stay with you until the end." Death placed a skeletal hand on the man's wrinkled one. 

The man squeezed Death's hand. "I'm ready, old friend. Thank you for the warnings, and for all the lovely conversations. I have so enjoyed your company over the years. Let us go."

Arm in arm, the two figures strode into the night, talking quietly of memories as the stars blinked into blackness.
