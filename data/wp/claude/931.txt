I yawned and stretched, waking from a deep sleep. Sunlight filtered through the blinds as I opened my eyes. It appeared to be a normal Saturday morning. 

I got out of bed and walked to the bathroom, scratching my head. I turned on the light and froze in my tracks. My reflection in the mirror had its arms crossed and an annoyed expression on its face.

"We need to talk," my reflection said.

I blinked in disbelief. I must still be dreaming. Reflections can't talk. 

"This isn't a dream," my reflection said, as if reading my thoughts. "We really do need to have a serious conversation."

My mind raced, trying to make sense of the impossibility before me. Am I going crazy? Are my eyes playing tricks on me? I closed my eyes and shook my head, then slowly opened them again. My reflection was still staring back at me, looking irritated.

"I don't have all day," my reflection said. "Are you going to speak or do I need to give you another minute to comprehend this?"

I stammered, struggling to find words. Nothing in my life had prepared me for a talking mirror reflection. "H-how is this happening?" I finally asked.

My reflection rolled its eyes. "How isn't important. What's important is we address the way you've been living your life lately. The constant procrastination, the junk food binges, spending hours streaming pointless shows and scrolling social media. You need to make a change." 

I frowned, defensive. Who was this reflection to lecture me about my life choices? But deep down, I knew it was right. I had fallen into some unhealthy habits and routines. I knew I should be taking better care of myself, setting small goals, being more social, choosing more nutritious foods. My reflection was calling me out, forcing me to confront the realities I had been avoiding for too long.

"You're right," I said with a sigh. My reflection gave a curt nod, then fell silent, its disapproving eyes staring straight at me. The message had been delivered. It was time to make a change. I took a deep breath and smiled at my reflection, ready to face the day with a fresh resolve: today is the day I start living a better life. My reflection smiled back, arms now uncrossed. Together, we could do this.
