The Last Chance 

I tapped furiously on the keyboard, crunching the data again. There had to be a point where it all went wrong, a nexus event I could travel back to and fix. As the last man alive, preventing the extinction of humanity was my sole purpose.

The timeline display flickered as I reviewed the major events of the 21st and 22nd centuries. Everything seemed uneventful until the 2070s. There were no obvious divergence points I could identify as the genesis of the Downfall. I slammed my fist on the desk in frustration. How did we go from a thriving global population of over 10 billion to near-extinction in just a few decades?

I steepled my fingers and tried to think logically. The major climate shifts started in 2062, crop failures and food shortages came a decade later. But climate change alone shouldn't have depopulated the planet. There must have been another factor, something more sinister and targeted. 

A flash of insight hit me—the global trend of declining birth rates started in the 2040s. At the time it was seen as a good thing, a sign of increasing development and prosperity. But what if it wasn't entirely natural? What if there was something more at work, reducing fertility on a global scale? I pulled up datasets on population growth, environmental factors and epidemiological studies from that era.

There. A study from 2049 noted that average sperm counts had dropped over 50% compared to the early 2000s. The researchers thought it was likely due to increased environmental contaminants, but couldn't determine a single cause. Over the following decades, fertility declined precipitously, at a rate far beyond the projections from that initial study. It appeared this trend wasn't limited to any region or population—it was affecting humanity worldwide.

My heart raced as the pieces fell into place. This was it—the point at which to travel back to. Sometime in the 2040s, something was unleashed that slowly and steadily sterilized the vast majority of the planet. Within a generation, the birth rate plummeted below replacement level and the looming demographic collapse began. By the time world leaders recognized the existential threat, it was too late. Global society unraveled rapidly under the twin catastrophes of shifting climate and declining population. 

I entered the destination date into the time machine: January 1, 2040. Just before the trend of dropping sperm counts was first documented. I knew what I had to do—find and contain the agent responsible, whatever it may be. Contamination, bioweapon, pollutant—I didn't know exactly what caused the fertility crisis, but now I had a chance to go back and stop it before it could ravage humanity. 

My knuckles turned white as I gripped the activation switch. This was my only shot to change the course of history and save mankind from extinction. I took a deep breath and threw the switch. The time machine hummed with energy and within moments I was hurtling back to the year 2040. The future was unwritten, and the fate of humanity lay solely in my hands. My name is Mateusz Konarzewski, and I'm the last hope for the future.
