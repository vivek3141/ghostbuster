The loud pounding on my front door startled me awake. I glanced at the clock: 3:14 am. Who could it possibly be at this hour? 

I stumbled out of bed and peered through the peephole. It was my ex, Jess, looking disheveled and distressed. I sighed and opened the door.

"I'm sorry, I didn't know where else to go," Jess said, tears streaming down her face. My heart sank as I braced myself for another desperate tale of woe.

"My car broke down and my phone is dead. I've been walking for hours. Can I come in?" Jess asked. I hesitated but ultimately stepped aside to let her in. She sat on my couch, shaking from the cold and crying. I awkwardly patted her back.

"Do you need anything? Water? Food?" I asked. Jess shook her head. 

"I just need a place to stay tonight until I can get my car towed in the morning. I'm so sorry to barge in on you like this."

I took a deep breath. Jess had a habit of turning to me in her times of crisis, despite us being broken up for nearly a year. I always let her back in, hoping this time would be different. But it never was. 

"Jess, you need to call one of your friends to help you, not me," I said firmly. She looked stunned. I had never refused to come to her aid before.

"But...you're the only one I could think of," she protested.

"We're not together anymore," I said. "I can't keep dropping everything whenever you need something. It's not healthy for either of us. You have a phone - call a friend or family member to help you out of this situation. I'm going back to bed."

Jess stared at me in disbelief. But for once, I stood my ground. She slowly rose from the couch and walked to the door, turning back to look at me one more time before leaving. I closed the door behind her with a mix of emotions - sadness, regret, but also a sense of empowerment. I had finally done what was best for me instead of falling back into old patterns. I went to bed feeling more confident in myself than I had in a long time. The rest was up to Jess - I had set her free, and now I could move on with my own life.
