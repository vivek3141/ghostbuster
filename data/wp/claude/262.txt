The ships appeared without warning one day, massive dark shadows obscuring the sun as they descended from the sky. The alien invasion had begun. 

Panic ensued at first. Governments collapsed, militaries mobilized, and civilians braced for the unknown. But after the initial shock, an eerie calm set in. The aliens didn't attack. They didn't bombard cities or enslave humanity. They just...landed. Hundreds of ships stationing themselves evenly across the globe.

Weeks passed without contact. People started to ignore the looming ships and went back to their daily lives. Some even moved on to speculating whether the aliens would share their advanced technology or take us to distant stars.

Months later, I was walking to work as usual when I saw one of the aliens for the first time. It was exiting a coffee shop, steaming cup in hand. To my surprise, the alien looked utterly...normal. Two arms and two legs, dressed in a suit that wouldn't look out of place on any city street. The only difference was its blue tinged skin and lack of hair. 

I stood frozen in place as it walked past me, expecting something, anything. But it just smiled politely and continued on its way. And in that moment I realized the truth.

The aliens hadn't come to invade or conquer. They were here to do the most normal, everyday thing possible. To live, work and blend in. Our planet had been annexed not with a fight but with a shrug of acceptance. The aliens had taken over the world, and nothing had really changed. The realization was both unsettling and oddly comforting. And as I walked the rest of the way to work, I wondered if this was ultimately for the best. The aliens had brought not an ending but a beginning. A chance to start again. Together.
