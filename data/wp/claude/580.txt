The trenches were cold and muddy as Private Midas trudged through, rifle in hand. His golden eyes scanned the barbed wire and smoke-filled no man's land that separated the British and German lines. His unit had been stuck here for months, fighting for inches of lifeless dirt. 

Midas joined the army two years ago, lying about his age to enlist. While other soldiers whispered of his strange golden eyes, none questioned his bravery or skill. His supernatural ability to turn anything into gold with a single touch was his secret. He never dared use it, for fear of being labeled a freak.

One night, German artillery pounded their trench, collapsing the walls and wounding many men. In the chaos, a soldier cried out that his legs were trapped under wooden beams. Midas rushed over and grasped the beams, turning them into gold. The soldier scrambled free, amazed at the miracle.  

Word spread of Midas's power. Officers brought crates of rations, ammunition, and supplies for him to turn to gold. Soon, the trenches glittered with golden objects, boosting morale. The generals hatched a plan: have Midas touch enemy cannons to disable them.  

Under cover of night, Midas crawled across no man's land. But as he reached to touch an enemy Howitzer, a German soldier spotted him. Midas reacted quickly, grazing the soldier's arm. The man screamed as his arm turned to gold, useless and heavy.

The Germans captured Midas. Generals and scientists studied his golden touch, forcing him to demonstrate on objects - and people. They were fascinated yet fearful of his unnatural power.  

Meanwhile, the British hatched a rescue mission. Sergeant Achilles, a soldier rumored to have been dipped in the River Styx as a child, making his body impenetrable, volunteered to rescue Midas. Under cover of night, Achilles stormed the German bunker, bullets ricocheting off his hardened skin, and carried the weakened Midas back to British lines.

Achilles and Midas were hailed as heroes. With their superhuman abilities and bravery, stories spread that they were immortal legends reborn, destined to lead the army to victory. Officers promoted them to Captain and gave them command of the newly-formed "Gold Company."

During an assault, Gold Company was tasked with storming the heavily-fortified German bunkers. While regular soldiers fell to machine gun fire, Midas and Achilles survived and pressed forward. They fought their way inside a bunker, emerging moments later with 50 German prisoners in golden handcuffs.  

The site of Midas and Achilles leading a company of immortal legends struck fear into the Germans. Believing they faced an invincible enemy, the German lines soon fell. As the war drew to an end, Captains Midas and Achilles were celebrated as heroes who helped turn the tide of war in the Allies' favor, using the gifts of the gods themselves. Their legend would live on forever.
