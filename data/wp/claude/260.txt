The old freighter lurched as it jumped to faster than light speed. Captain Jenna Marcks steadied herself on the railing of the command deck and checked the instruments. All systems were stable. The FTL drive was purring like a kitten. 

Jenna settled into her captain's chair and unwrapped the sandwich she had brought up from the galley. It was going to be an uneventful couple of days traveling at many times the speed of light to deliver machine parts to a mining colony on the edge of the system.

As Jenna took her first bite, the proximity alarm blared. She nearly choked on her sandwich. An object was rapidly approaching them from the direction of their travel. She slammed the alert to bring the ship out of FTL. The freighter shuddered as it dropped back into normal space.

There on the viewscreen was another ship, a small cargo hauler, drifting dead in space directly in their path. They had nearly collided at many times the speed of light. Jenna's heart raced at how close they had come to disaster. 

"Captain, that ship's been reported missing for over a year," said her navigator, checking the registry. 

Jenna moved her freighter closer to the derelict ship for a better look. The outside appeared intact. "Any life signs?" she asked.  

"No, ma'am. She's completely without power. Records show she had a crew of four."

A chill went down Jenna's spine. There were tales of horrors that could befall a ship traveling at FTL. Being stranded between dimensions was one of them. "Prepare to dock and board. We need to find out what happened."

Donning environment suits, Jenna and her first mate crossed to the cargo ship. The airlock opened with a hiss. Their lights illuminated a narrow corridor, and Jenna gasped.

The walls were covered in scratches and dents, like something had been frantically trying to escape. They moved slowly down the hall to the cockpit. What they found sent a jolt of terror through Jenna.

Skeletons were strewn around the cockpit, as if the crew had been battling each other. One had deep claw marks gouged into its environmental suit. 

Jenna turned to run back to her ship, but her first mate wasn't behind her. His light was darting around a corner. She went after him and screamed.

There he was, floating amid more skeletons in a crew cabin, his helmet fogged completely opaque. She dragged him back to their ship, not looking too closely at the horrors around her.  

Once aboard with the airlock sealed, she tore off his helmet. He took a gasping breath, but his eyes were locked in a stare, his mouth locked in a silent scream. 

Medics rushed to him, but he was completely unresponsive. Jenna realized with dawning horror that whatever fate had befallen that ship and its crew had now come to claim them as well. She ordered the freighter back into FTL, not caring about their destination, just trying to escape that nightmare behind them.

But she knew, as her crew descended into madness around her, that there would be no escape from the terrors that dwell in the spaces between dimensions. Their doomed freighter hurtled on through the faster than light void, and Jenna screamed.
