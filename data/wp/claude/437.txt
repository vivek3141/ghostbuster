Once a god, now forgotten. The temple crumbled, the followers long gone. Enitharmon, the tranquil one, the keeper of harmony, wandered the overgrown marble halls that were once filled with song and praise and sacrifice.

Her powers had waned with the loss of belief. She was only a glimmer now, a faint outline of her once radiant self. But still she lingered, unwilling to let go of what remained. 

She drifted through a hole in the roof and up into the night sky, sailing on the faint aromas of the incense and offerings of old. But instead of hearing prayers, she now only sensed the indifference of the stars. Mortals had turned their faces to new gods, or to no god at all.

Enitharmon spotted a campfire in the distance, the only light for miles across the abandoned hills that were once the heart of her domain. She glided down and saw three humans, travelers on a long journey. They were laughing and talking with the easy camaraderie of those who have faced hardship together.

As Enitharmon hovered at the edge of their firelight, the youngest of the three, a girl with wild curls and a ready smile, suddenly shuddered. "Do you feel something?" she asked the others. The companions shook their heads. But the girl stood up and peered into the darkness, straight at Enitharmon.

Against all hope and reason, Enitharmon sang out a single note into the girl's mind. A note of harmony, of balance, of light and calm.  The girl's eyes widened. For a fleeting moment, the two gazed at each other across an impossible divide. 

Then the girl shook her head and shrugged, dismissing it as her imagination. She sat back down by the fire, picking up the thread of the conversation again.

Enitharmon faded back into the night, her spirit lifted. The memory of her song would remain with that mortal, an echo of divinity in a world that thought it had moved on. Though her time was past, her gift endured. Harmony lived on.
