It was just another Tuesday morning. John was making breakfast as the kids got ready for school. 

Suddenly, there was a bright flash outside. The power went out. John looked out the window but couldn't see anything unusual.

A few minutes later, the power came back on. The TV flicked on by itself. An emergency alert was broadcasting on every channel:

"Citizens of the United States, remain calm. Five minutes ago, everyone in the country was exposed to a harmless agent as part of an experiment. You may feel strange side effects over the next hour like nausea or hallucinations. These will pass. Emergency services are standing by. Remain indoors until the all-clear is given. Do not be alarmed—you have not been poisoned or exposed to radiation. This was a controlled release of a harmless substance. Await further instructions."

John started to feel very strange. The room seemed to swirl around him. His kids were describing odd sensations too. He looked out the window—the whole neighborhood seemed to sway and ripple. 

After a tense hour of waiting, the TV flashed an alert again: "All clear. The effects have passed. America, we apologize for any alarm. This widespread test will help us better defend the nation. God bless America."

John shook off the last of the bizarre side effects. His kids seemed back to normal too, talking about what an interesting day it had turned out to be. John was left unsure how to feel—while relieved it was over, he wondered anxiously what on earth had just happened to the country. Life seemed likely to go on as usual, but it felt like things might never be quite the same again.
