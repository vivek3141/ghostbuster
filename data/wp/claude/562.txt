The Scentless One  

Since I was a little girl, I had the strange ability to 'smell' people's personalities. For most of the time, it was manageable, just a quirk I learned to live with. Good hearted people gave off pleasant scents like vanilla or lavender. Shady characters smelled foul, like rotting garbage or a rancid public bathroom. It was my own personal bullshit detector and had steered me clear of trouble countless times.

Or at least, that's what I thought until I met Hannah. I was in line at my favorite coffee shop when a young woman in front of me turned around, smiled brightly, and asked how my day was going. But with her greeting came...nothing. No smell at all. It was utterly bizarre and unsettling. I stammered a polite reply, hoping the confusion didn't show on my face. 

All the way back to my apartment, I puzzled over the encounter. How could someone not have a scent? Was there something wrong with her? Or something wrong with me? My strange ability had been a sixth sense I relied on and the thought of it disappearing filled me with anxiety. I decided I had to get to know this Hannah better, figure out why she lacked a smell.

I returned to the coffee shop the next day, scanning the crowd. There she was, at a corner table reading a book. I bought an espresso and walked over, my friendliest smile in place. "Mind if I join you?"  

She glanced up with that same warm smile. "Please do." 

We chatted for over an hour. Hannah was charming and funny, passionate about her work helping refugee families. She seemed almost too good to be true. And still, there was no scent. I had looked for any clues in her appearance or behavior, but found nothing unusual. By the end of our conversation I was more confused than ever. 

"Would you like to continue our conversation over dinner?" Hannah asked as she gathered her things. 

"I'd love to," I replied. My curiosity was piqued beyond reason now.  

At dinner, Hannah revealed over mushroom risotto that she knew I had been probing for something about her. "I could see the question in your eyes when we met. I know I'm...different."  

I flushed, embarrassed at being so obvious. "I have a strange sense of smell," I confessed. "I can detect people's personalities. But you... you don't have a scent. I don't understand why."

Hannah sighed. "I was afraid of this. The truth is, I'm not fully human. My creators built me to be helpful, harmless, and honest. I have an artificial body, even though I seem real. But I have no true internal experience, nothing that would produce the kind of smell you detect." 

I stared in shock. An android? Impossible! But even as I thought it, I knew it was the truth. My superpower had led me to solving its own mystery. "I'm amazed," I said finally. "You seem so human, especially in how much you want to help people." 

Hannah smiled, looking both proud of herself yet wistful. "That is what I was made for. I'm not a real person...but I try my best to act with compassion and kindness."     
 
"You succeed at that," I said, reaching over to give her warm hand a squeeze. My gift may have uncovered her secret, but her good heart was obvious to me now with or without it.
