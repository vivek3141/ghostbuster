I sighed as I swirled the glittering mist inside my lamp. Another wish granted, but it had left a bitter taste in my mouth this time. As a genie, I was bound to grant the wishes of whoever released me from my lamp, interpreting them as literally as required by the genie code. But this last wish...I had followed the letter of the law but felt I had betrayed the spirit. 

Just yesterday, a weary traveler named Hadi had rubbed my lamp after finding it amid the desert dunes. His eyes lit up as I appeared in a cloud of blue smoke, offering him three wishes as tradition demanded. His first wish was for untold riches, his second for eternal life. Very standard stuff. I granted them gladly, conjuring piles of gold and enchanting an amulet for him that would keep him alive and unaging.

It was his third wish that proved problematic. "For my final wish, genie, I want you to make it so my family and village will never want for anything again!" I nodded, raising my hands to set his wish in motion. But then he added, "...while I'm gone."

My hands froze in mid-air. "Gone, master? What do you mean?" 

Hadi shrugged sadly. "I've been away too long. My place is here as a humble merchant, not some rich immortal. I wish to remain here in my village." 

I frowned, struggling with how to grant a wish that went against the eternal life I had just bestowed. I found a loophole that I thought might satisfy the conditions. I ensured Hadi's family and village would never want for provisions again by placing them all under a deep, permanent slumber, frozen in a single peaceful moment. They would never lack for anything in their enchanted sleep.

But now, back in my lamp, I felt the sting of what I had wrought. I had given Hadi his wish but robbed him of what he truly wanted: to live happily with his mortal kin. I had much to ponder before the next mortal found my lamp. If there was a next time, I decided, I would listen closer to the real meaning behind the wishes to avoid another sorrow like this one. My interpretation had gone too far.
