The Council of Organs 

The Brain rapped his knuckles on the table, calling the meeting to order. "Alright everyone, settle down. We have a lot to discuss from yesterday's activities. Heart, let's start with you. How did the circulation go?"

The Heart sighed. "It was another exhausting day. Over 100,000 beats to keep everything moving. The blood pressure was a bit high in the afternoon, but Kidneys helped by filtering more fluid. Lungs, how was the oxygen supply?" 

"Breathing was steady and strong, Heart," replied the Lungs. "Plenty of fresh oxygen delivered throughout the body. I only had to deal with a couple dust particles - nothing major to report."

The Brain nodded in approval. "Excellent. Stomach, you've been working hard recently. How did the digestion go?" 

The Stomach groaned. "That burrito last night was a bad idea. I'm still recovering. Next time, easier on the chili sauce, please! Intestines and I were up half the night processing everything." 

The Intestines glared at the Stomach. "Speak for yourself! I did most of the work while you just churned away. But everything is flowing smoothly again now."

"My apologies, friends," said the Brain. "I'll be more considerate with the meal choices today. Now, today's agenda..." 

The meeting continued, with reports from the Liver, Muscles, Bones, and the rest. The previous day's events were reviewed, inefficiencies noted, and new plans set in motion. 

"Before we conclude," said the Brain, "I want to commend each and every one of you. Our human has now lived over 10,000 days, and it is only through your tireless work and cooperation that this has been possible. I am proud of this council, and honored to preside over such a dedicated team of life-giving organs. So keep up the good work - meeting adjourned!"

A cheer arose as the organs went their separate ways, already beginning the important work of powering a new day for their human. Beat by beat, breath by breath, their silent labor continued as it always had, the invisible council working in unison.
