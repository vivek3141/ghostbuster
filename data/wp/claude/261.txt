I woke up and glanced at the glowing number on my chest: 3,000,000. My heart sank. How did this happen? Just yesterday it was 1.

I walked downstairs, hands shaking. My roommate looked at me and gasped. “What did you do?”  

“Nothing! I have no idea how it changed.” I had never intentionally hurt anyone. This had to be a mistake.

Panic rose in my chest. I had to stop this, but how? I couldn’t control something I didn’t understand. 

I spent the day chained to my bed, crying, pleading with the unseen force controlling the numbers. “Please, change it back. I don’t want to hurt anyone!”

Night fell. The number dropped to 2,999,999. One life saved. I sobbed in relief.

The next morning, the counter read 10. I had been given a second chance. I knew my purpose now - to cherish each life, help however I could. I dedicated myself to volunteering, donating, spreading compassion. 

One month later, my number glowed 0. I had bested fate, through humanity and grace. Our future is not set in stone. With determination and kindness, we can change destiny itself. I emerged, not a killer, but a savior. My life's purpose was to value each fleeting moment, each fragile soul. And that, I knew, would be my eternal mission.
