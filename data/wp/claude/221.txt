You take a deep breath and place your hands on the dummy's chest. One, two, three compressions. Pump, pump, pump. You've done CPR training before, but you want to make sure your skills are still sharp. 

30 compressions, then two rescue breaths. You tilt the dummy's head back, pinch its nose and breathe into the mouth. The fake lips feel oddly spongy. As you exhale the second rescue breath, the dummy's eyes suddenly pop open.

You stumble back in shock. The dummy takes a rattling breath and starts coughing. It sits up, looks around the room, then locks eyes with you.

"Where...where am I?" the dummy says in a scratchy voice. 

Your jaw hangs open. "You're in the CPR training room at the community center," you stammer. How is this possible? Dummies can't come to life. You must be dreaming or hallucinating.

The dummy nods and swings its legs over the side of the table. "And you were practicing CPR on me?" 

"Well, trying to. I mean, you're a dummy. You're not supposed to be alive!"

The dummy examines its plastic hands and torso in confusion. "You're right, I'm not sure how this happened. But I appear to be animate now." It slides off the table and stands shakily on two feet, swaying slightly.

You stare in disbelief, wondering if you've completely lost your mind. There's no way this dummy has somehow come to life after a CPR lesson. You must be having a very vivid dream or psychotic episode. 

"Don't be alarmed," the dummy says, holding up its hands. "I mean you no harm. In fact, I should be thanking you. You have given me a second chance at life, it seems."

You blink furiously, hoping the dummy will go back to being an inanimate mannequin. But it remains standing there, gazing at you with a polite smile on its plastic face.

Your heart hammers in your chest. "This isn't possible," you whisper. "You can't just spring to life. I have to be dreaming or something."

The dummy tilts its head. "You make a fair point. I do not have a scientific explanation for how I have gained consciousness and animation. All I know is one moment there was nothing, the next I could think and feel and talk, thanks to you." 

You shake your head vehemently. "No, no way. This is crazy. I'm just going to...go. I have to get out of here." You back away from the dummy slowly, then turn and flee from the room, the sound of its confused protests following you as you run.
