The subway car rattled down the tracks as I scanned the familiar faces of my fellow commuters. Times New Roman, Arial, the occasional expressive Comic Sans. After so many years riding this line, I had gotten accustomed to the variety of typographical voices that filled this underground world. 

At 42nd Street, a flood of new passengers poured through the opening doors. In the crush of bodies, one figure stood out. A young woman holding onto a pole had a font I had never seen before. Lithe curves, thick and thin strokes combined in a script I couldn’t identify. As she brushed a lock of hair back from her face, I saw the strange font wasn’t just for show—it was how she naturally moved through the world.

I had to know more. I pushed through the throng and grabbed the pole next to her as the train lurched forward. 

“I couldn't help but notice your unique style,” I said. She turned to look at me, puzzled. Up close, her font was even more unfamiliar yet pleasing to the eye.

“I'm not sure I know what you mean,” she said. Her voice matched her font, a melody of tones high and low. 

“Your font,” I said. “It's different than most.”

Realization dawned on her face. “Oh, I see. My 'font.' How I present myself to the world.” She gave a small smile. “I was born with it. Not everyone appreciates such a distinctive style.”

"I find it fascinating," I said. "If you don't mind me asking, what's the name of your font?"

"I don't know that it has a name. I've just always been this way."

"Would you like to get coffee?" The words tumbled out of my mouth before I could stop them. But I had to know more about this woman and herfont. The windows beyond the subway car were dark and lonely looking, but she was illuminated by a warm glow.  I wanted to know anything and everything about her unusual typography.  

Her font conveyed surprise, but also pleasure at the invitation. "Why not? I'm Odessa." 

"Vic. Pleased to meet you." The train began to slow, but my pulse quickened at the prospect of learning the story behind Odessa's mysterious and captivating font. This was one adventure in typography I wouldn't soon forget.
