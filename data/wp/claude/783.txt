The alarm sounded at the military base. There were reports of an explosion in the atmosphere above Washington D.C. Initial readings showed high levels of radiation and electromagnetic activity. It was unclear what exactly had happened. 

The President was rushed into a bunker for safety. Government officials were confused and concerned. Had another nation attacked them with a nuclear weapon? Was this an act of terrorism? Or was it some kind of new and unknown weapon?

The scientists were baffled as they looked at the data. The energy signature and effects didn't match anything they had seen before. It was something unfamiliar and, well, unclear. They feared the worst but didn't know how to respond or if there would be more attacks. 

The news spread panic across the country. People flooded stores to stock up on supplies. There were runs on gas stations and banks were inundated with people withdrawing cash. No one knew what was safe and what might be contaminated. Millions fled the cities, creating traffic nightmares.

Three days later, the strange readings had dissipated and radiation levels were back to normal background levels. The scientists finally concluded it was unlikely an actual nuclear bomb, at least not one that matched known profiles. But what it really was remained a mystery.

The country slowly started returning to normal but nerves were frayed. An unclear attack shook people to their core in a way a familiar threat may not have. The unknown has a way instilling a primal kind of fear. The President eventually addressed the nation, calming fears but warning people to remain vigilant.

While the U.S. had dodged a nuclear threat, the experience highlighted just how vulnerable the nation was to new and emerging weapons of terror. And until they knew what exactly they had witnessed, everyone would be on edge wondering if and when another unclear attack might come. The end.
