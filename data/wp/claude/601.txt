My whole life I knew I was different. I could bend water and air, while my twin brother could bend fire and earth. We were born as two halves of the avatar, destined to maintain balance in the world. 

Growing up, my parents trained us to use our bending responsibly. While other children played, we practiced. My brother struggled with restraint, often losing his temper and triggering rockslides or wildfires. I had the opposite problem, frequently getting distracted and creating unintended whirlwinds or waves.

As we came of age, unrest grew in the kingdom. The resistance, a group of benders determined to rule over nonbenders, amassed power. The current avatar had disappeared, and balance was under threat. Rumors spread that my brother and I were the new avatar, split at birth. 

One night, I awoke to smoke and chaos in the village. The resistance was raiding homes, rounding up dissenters. They broke down our door, subduing my parents and brother easily with their combined earth and fire. 

Their leader, sensing my power, grinned. "So it's you. The other half of the avatar. Now I will destroy you, and no one will be left to stop us!"

He hurled a giant fireball at me. I dispersed it with a blast of air, then whipped up a waterspout, flinging the intruders into the sea. All but the leader, who stood with hands raised, trembling. 

"Please, have mercy!" he begged. I considered ending the threat he posed, but that was not the avatar's way.

I bound him in chains of water, just as my brother came to. We nodded at each other, a silent understanding passing between us. Our time had come at last.

We set out the next day to repair the damage done by the resistance across the kingdom. My brother restored ravaged lands and villages with fresh soil and new life. I brought rain to end wildfires, and calmed raging rivers. Word spread quickly of the two benders who could both create and restore. The resistance released their grip, their leader still chained and left to think on his actions.

Balance was returned, for now, as my brother and I took up our lifelong duty. The split avatar.
