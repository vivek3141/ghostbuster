The Board of Directors of ChemCo sat around the mahogany table, puffing on cigars and congratulating themselves. The new pesticide they had developed, ToxoChem, was selling like hotcakes to farmers across the country. But there was one problem - it seemed ToxoChem had some unintended side effects, poisoning local water supplies and wildlife. Several small towns had reported mysterious illnesses and unexplained animal deaths. 

"We need a distraction, gentlemen," said the CEO, Mr. Jenkins. "Something big enough to take the public's mind off these little incidents. Any suggestions?"

The room was silent until a smile crept onto the face of the head of marketing, Mr. Smith. "I think I have an idea. How about...an alien invasion?"

The board erupted into laughter and then enthusiasm. They spent the rest of the afternoon hashing out the details of how they would stage fake UFO sightings, mysterious emissions from the night sky, and eventually phony radio broadcasts to whip up hysteria about an impending invasion from Mars. By the time they adjourned the meeting, the hoax was set in motion.

Unbeknownst to the board of directors, a real alien spacecraft was observing all this from high above. "The humans have handed us the perfect opportunity," said the alien commander. "Their fake 'UFO' sightings and panic will provide cover for our actual invasion. By the time they realize the truth, it will be too late!" The alien fleet began moving into position, using ChemCo's deception as a mask to conceal their accelerating preparations to invade Earth. The board's irresponsible quest for profits was about to unleash a threat they could never have imagined.
