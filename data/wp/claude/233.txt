You begin to wonder why so many top comments are being removed on Reddit. You suddenly begin to notice a trend in the context of the removed posts... what they're hiding startles you deeply.  

It started with just a few comments here and there on some popular AskReddit threads. Some seemingly innocuous but humorous comments with hundreds of upvotes would disappear without a trace. You figured it must have been people deleting their own comments for some reason. 

But then you noticed it happening on other subs too. Long thought-out comments on technology and politics subs were also vanishing. These comments had sparked engaging discussion and debate, and they were being erased.

Your curiosity got the better of you, so you started taking screenshots of popular threads when they were first posted to compare later. When you looked back at the screenshots, the missing comments were all ones that were even mildly critical or skeptical about certain companies and products. Anything that painted tech companies or politicians in a slightly negative light was being wiped from existence.  

You began to get an uneasy feeling in your stomach. Was this some sort of bizarre censorship on Reddit? But who would be behind that, and why?

You decided to do some testing to see if your theory was correct. You posted a few innocuous but critical comments about a major tech company and politician on some popular subs. Within minutes, they were gone without a trace. You posted another comment praising the same company and politician—that comment remained untouched.

Your heart began to race. This couldn't be real, could it? Reddit had always been a bastion of free speech on the internet. Who would possibly have the power and influence to censor and manipulate discourse on this massive scale?

In a flash, it became clear. There were powerful entities—politicians, corporations, and lobbying groups—that had a vested interest in controlling narratives and influencing opinions on social media. They must have found a way to infiltrate the ranks of Reddit moderators and administrators to scrub the site of anything that didn't fit their agenda.

The realization of how deeply in control and monitored these powerful forces must be on platforms like Reddit was deeply unsettling. You knew this was a type of censorship and manipulation that undermined the democratic principles of free speech and open discourse. The future implications were staggering and filled you with dread. You wondered if the truth behind this sinister turn of events would ever come to light—or if the majority of Reddit users would just remain blissfully unaware of how their reality was being quietly constructed for them, one deleted comment at a time.
