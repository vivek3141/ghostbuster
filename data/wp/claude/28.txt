The training center loomed before me, all glass and steel. This was my future, for better or worse. To be molded into a leader, a dictator to rule our fledgling space colonies with an iron fist.

My name is Akiko and I am one of a few hundred children gathered from around Earth and its colonies to be trained in this facility. We come from all backgrounds but have two things in common: we demonstrate strong leadership qualities and our IQ scores are off the charts. 

The doors slide open as I approach, revealing a stark white interior. A tall woman stands waiting for me, a warm smile on her face.

"Welcome, Akiko. You are the final candidate to arrive. Your training starts today." Her tone is friendly but firm. I sense this will be the last bit of warmth I feel for years. My training, my life from now on will be cold, relentless work. 

The days begin early and end late. We receive instruction on politics, economics, military strategy, and more. They break us down and build us back up again into their model of a perfect dictator. Some break under the pressure, washed out of the program to live normal lives. The rest of us forge on; competitors now but one day ruler and subordinates.

Years pass in a blur of studies, exams, and physical training. I form few friendships, trusting none of the others. I know if I show any weakness it may be the end of me. I watch as some of the most promising candidates are dismissed from the program without warning. The pool of potential dictators narrows until only a handful remain.

We are in our final days of training when I am summoned alone before the Director of the facility. I stand at attention, trying to keep my nerves in check. This is the moment I have both anticipated and feared for years.

"Candidate 012, Akiko. You have surpassed all expectations and standards set for a potential dictator. Your scores across all measures are exemplary. It is the decision of this council that you be named Supreme Dictator of the space colonies. From this day forward, your rule is law."

A wave of emotions wash over me - triumph, anxiety, determination. My training has prepared me for this moment. I came here as a child but stand now ready to lead our people into the future. Democracy may have failed in the vastness of space but in its place rises an exceptional leader. I will not fail in my duty. Under my rule, the colonies will thrive and humanity's light will shine even into the farthest edges of the galaxy.
