No, no no no...  She backed up and turned the other way the second she saw me heading towards her.

It had been six months since we broke up, but the pain was still raw. I guess I should have known running into Lisa at this coffee shop was inevitable in a town this small. Part of me hoped that enough time had passed that we could have a casual, friendly exchange. But the look of dread that washed over her face when our eyes met crushed that hope instantly.

She spun around and walked briskly in the opposite direction, dumping the remains of her coffee in the trash on the way out. I stood frozen for a moment, stung, before slowly making my way to the counter to order. 

The barista gave me a sympathetic look. "The usual?" 

I nodded. My hands felt clammy as I paid and moved over to wait for my drink. Why did it still have to hurt this much? I knew ending things had been the right decision. We wanted different things. We were not right for each other. I had repeated this to myself hundreds of times over the past six months, trying to convince my heart to accept what my head already knew. But in that moment, staring at the door she had disappeared through, my heart stubbornly refused to listen. 

"Large latte?" The barista's voice broke through my reverie as she placed the drink on the counter. 

"Thanks," I muttered, taking the cup. I made my way to a table by the window, hoping the familiar routine of drinking coffee while reading the paper would help calm my nerves. But today the words on the page blurred in front of me, my mind insisting on replaying memories I had tried so hard to forget. 

Lisa, her head thrown back, laughing at some silly joke I had made. The way her eyes lit up when I brought her flowers for no reason. How she would sing softly to herself when she cooked breakfast on Sunday mornings, convinced she couldn't be heard over the sizzling bacon. The thousands of little moments, haphazardly strung together, that made up the fabric of our relationship and filled me with a warmth I feared I would never feel again.

The coffee had long grown cold by the time I checked my watch. I gathered my things slowly, reluctant to leave the sanctuary of   coffee shop purgatory and face the rest of my day. But staying here wouldn't change what had happened.  wouldn't make the memories fade any faster. And it certainly wouldn't make running into Lisa any less painful the next time. There was nothing I could do but keep living my life, keep putting one foot in front of the other, and hope that eventually the hurt would dull into a soft ache rather than a sharp stab.   

I took a deep breath and walked through the door she had disappeared through not long ago, steeling myself against the pain that lingered in her wake. The day marched on, time refusing to stand still or turn back, no matter how desperately I wished otherwise. All I could do was match its steady rhythm, healing slowly to its muted beat.
