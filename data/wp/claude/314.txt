The emergency meeting was called to order in the vast, gleaming chamber that served as a neutral meeting place between Heaven and Hell. Representatives from both the all-good and all-evil realms were in attendance. 

Saint Peter stood up to address the assembled angels, demons, and other assorted supernatural entities. "Thank you all for coming. As you know, humanity's development of teleportation technology has caused an...overflow of souls entering both Heaven and Hell. The constant duplication of souls with each teleportation jump has stretched our resources to the breaking point. We must find a solution."

Murmurs of assent arose from the angels. The demons grunted, more annoyed at having to meet with their enemies than concerned over any resource issues. Resources were for the weak, andHell's resources were endless. 

A triple-headed dog demon named Fluffy snorted, "I don't see the problem. More souls just means more misery to feed on." The demons cackled in delight.

The angel Jophiel spread his wings in anger. "You monsters. Can't you see the inherent wrongness of exploiting duplicated souls? Each soul deserves individual judgment and afterlife. We can't simply...recycle them." The angels nodded vigorously in agreement.

Belphegor, a lazily lounging demon, yawned. "Seems an awful lot of work for no benefit. I vote we dump the new souls into the abyss and call it a day." The demons voiced their approval.

Saint Peter slammed his fist on the podium. "We will do no such thing! Each soul is a sacred responsibility. We must find a way to properly judge and shepherd every single soul, no matter how inefficient you demons find it."

A tiny, squeaky voice piped up from the back of the demon contingent. It was Carl, an imp who served mostly as a paperweight in the underworld's massive bureaucracy. "I have an idea," Carl offered hesitantly. The assembly went silent in surprise. "What if...we alternate? Heaven gets the original souls, Hell gets the first duplicates, then Heaven the next batch, and so on, each judging and governing their allotted souls. That way each soul finds its proper afterlife, and no realm is overwhelmed."

A stunned silence filled the chamber. Then Jophiel began to clap his hands. "It's brilliant." The angels joined in applause.

Even the demons were grudgingly impressed at the simple elegance of the solution. Beelzebub nodded at the tiny imp. "Well done, Carl. It seems we won't need to use you as kindling after all." Carl sighed in relief, his small triumph overshadowed by the continued threat of being burned for the demons' amusement. 

Saint Peter smiled. "The resolution passes. Let the sorting of souls begin!" At last, a compromise to save literal millions of souls, all thanks to a tiny demon who just wanted to be useful. Carl smiled, proud to have saved so many from a grim fate, even if his own fate remained uncertain day to day. His solution was a beacon of hope between two realms that had long abandoned hope of cooperation.
