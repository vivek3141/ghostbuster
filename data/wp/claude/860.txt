The crimson dragon flew over the towering spires of Aurum City, scanning the streets below with keen eyes. As a member of the City Guard, it was Glendun's job to keep the citizens safe.

Glendun swooped down toward the central market, landing with a mighty thud that shook the cobblestones. The crowd parted, giving the dragon a wide berth. He was here on official business.

"Good morning," he growled in a deep, rumbling voice. A young boy selling pastries shrieked and scurried away. Glendun sighed. Even after ten years serving the City Guard, the townsfolk weren't used to a dragon in uniform.

Glendun made his way over to a jewelry stall. "Madam, I have received reports you are selling enchanted amulets without a license. May I see your permit?"   The elf behind the counter stammered. Glendun had caught her red-handed. He was about to issue a citation when a loud roar pierced the air.

Glendun spun around to see a chimera charging down the street, knocking over carts and sending pedestrians fleeing. The beast was headed straight for a daycare, filled with helpless hatchlings.

Glendun spread his wings and took to the air. With a burst of flame, he intercepted the chimera before it could reach the daycare. The beast snarled, turning on Glendun with venomous fangs bared.  

Glendun dodged the chimera's attacks, trying to lure it away from bystanders. His heart raced, but his training took over. With lightning breath and swipes of his claws, he battered the chimera until it fled back out the city gates.  

As Glendun landed back in the market, the crowd erupted into cheers. "Three cheers for Glendun, hero of Aurum City!" they chanted. Glendun raised a claw to silence them.

"There are no heroes here today, only a guardian doing his duty," he said solemnly. His job was to protect the city, and that included everyone in it, whether they showed him respect or not. Glendun knew his role, and he was proud to serve. A smile crept onto his scaly face as hatchlings crowded around, singing his praises. Perhaps the townsfolk were getting used to their dragon guard after all.
