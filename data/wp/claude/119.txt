The pale streetlights flickered overhead as John wandered the empty streets, his footsteps echoing in the darkness. He paused under each light, holding up a photograph with hands made clumsy by nerves and grief, peering hopefully up at the windows and doorways lining the sidewalk. 

The photo showed a man's face, handsome yet stern, captured decades ago in black and white. John's own youthful face stared out from the image, almost unrecognizable now save for the eyes, which remained bright and sharp. Those eyes now scanned the shadows, hoping against hope for a glimpse of the man he had become.

It had been just another night at first. John had fallen asleep in his armchair as usual, dreaming of times long past. But he had awoken in a panic to find himself in unfamiliar darkness. There were no lamps, no wallpaper, no photographs on the walls. He was alone on a street he did not recognize, still weighed down by the creaks and pains of old age yet with a mind as sharp as it had been in his youth.

Some impossible trick of time had transported John's consciousness back while leaving his aged body behind. He knew with a dreadful certainty that if he could not find his way back - find himself - he would be doomed to wander lost forever in this grim labyrinth between past and present. 

And so he searched, showing his own face to strangers in a world he had long since left behind, haunted by the thought that he might have already passed by his resting place without knowing it. He peered up at dark windows, wondering which held his sleeping form, dreaming still of times now decades gone. 

The great wheel of time had turned but left John behind. His stiff and aching fingers clutched at memories like grains of sand, trickling away as he wandered the streets. The old photograph, once a memento of youth and possibility, had become a lifeline with the power to anchor him once more in the familiar comforts of the present, if only he could find the man whose face it showed - his face, yet not his own. The faded eyes of the long-ago subject stared out in desperation, as afraid of being lost as John himself, searching still for the way home.
