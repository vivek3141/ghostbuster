The founding fathers strode into the Capitol building, eyes ablaze with fury. George Washington's uniform was perfectly pressed as always, yet his lips were curled in a snarl beneath his powdered wig. 

Thomas Jefferson clutched a sheaf of papers - a draft of the Constitution, annotated with two centuries of changes. His knuckles were white.

Benjamin Franklin leaned on his cane, surveying the chandeliers and marble halls with disgust. "What have you done?" he muttered.

Just then, a tour group rounded the corner. The guide's chirp faded as the crowd froze, mouths agape. 

A young boy pointed. "Mom, are those-" 

His mother hushed him. The founding fathers' reputations preceded them like a chill.

Washington strode forward and slammed his fist on a desk, rattling the water pitcher. "How dare you?" He jabbed a finger at the tour group. "You have ruined this nation's spirit. You value material excess over principle; fame over integrity; individual gain over the common welfare."

Jefferson threw down his papers in disgust. "The government we created has mutated beyond recognition! Abuse of power runs rampant, and our sacred documents are twisted to serve selfish ends. We strove to create a just system, but you have corrupted it at every turn!"

A senator emerged from his office, distracted by the noise. When he realized the source, he stumbled back in shock. 

Franklin silenced the crowd with a raise of his hand. "We gave you freedom and representative government - gifts that you have squandered."  He sighed, the anger evaporating into disappointment. "We had hoped America would become an example to inspire future generations. Instead, you lead the free world in pursuit of empty distractions and divisions."

The silence rang out, heavy with shame and punctuated by Franklin's cane as he turned to hobble away. The founding fathers faded back into memory, their parting message echoing through the ages: liberty and justice for all, if we can keep it.
