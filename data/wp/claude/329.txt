The interrogation room was dimly lit and sparse. Just a metal table, two chairs, and a large mirror along one wall that I knew was a two-way window. I sat on one side of the table, waiting for the suspect to be brought in. 

My name is Detective Clara Johnson and I have a unique gift - I can read people's thoughts. It helps in my line of work, allowing me to sift through lies and uncover hidden clues in people's minds. But today I would discover something far more disturbing.

The door opened and two uniformed officers escorted in a man in handcuffs. "Have a seat," I said, gesturing to the chair across from me. The man sat. His face was blank, expressionless. 

"I'm Detective Johnson," I said. "And you are?" He didn't respond. Just gazed at me with those dull, empty eyes. I focused my mind on his, attempting to pick up his thoughts, get a read on his emotional state, see what was going on in his head. 

But I got nothing. No thoughts. An empty void. 

That can't be, I thought. Even in a meditative state, there are always some flickers of thoughts and feelings. But from this man - nothing. It was deeply unsettling.

I frowned, then tried again. "Sir, please state your name for the record." Again no response. Not even a blink. I pushed harder with my mind, desperate to pick up anything from his mental state. Still nothing. 

A chill ran down my spine. In all my years of interrogations, through the entire range of human emotions and mental states, I had never encountered someone with no thoughts at all. It seemed impossible, inhuman. 

I tried asking basic questions - where do you live, do you have family, did you commit the crimes you're accused of? But I was met only with that blank, emotionless stare. His eyes seemed almost dead.

I leaned forward, staring intently into those eyes, and focused every ounce of my mental energy on breaking through whatever barrier was blocking his thoughts. My head began to throb with the effort, but finally, something flickered at the edge of my perception.

A feeling of malevolence and dark intent slowly oozed out from the place where his mind should be. An alien consciousness stirring beneath the surface, vast and cold and frighteningly inhuman. 

I gasped and broke my gaze, shuddering. I now knew the truth. This was no ordinary man I was questioning. There was something else here wearing the disguise of human skin. Something evil and dangerous and very old. 

I stood up hastily and backed toward the door. I had to warn the others. Because whatever this creature was that sat before me, it did not belong in our world. And it was certainly not going to remain locked up for long in our interrogation room. My gift of reading minds had allowed a peek behind the veil of this unnatural entity. But now there would be a price to pay for that knowledge. Its Ancient gaze followed me as I left the room. And Its patience would soon come to an end.
