Ever since I was born I've possessed the power to teleport wherever I'm currently looking. At first it seemed like a gift, a special ability that set me apart from all the ordinary people in the world. My parents were shocked when I first disappeared from my crib as a baby, only to reappear in the tree outside the window that had caught my attention. 

As I grew up, I learned to control and hide this power of mine. But it set me apart in a way that made it hard to connect with others. I always felt like an outsider pretending to be normal. My teenage years were lonely as I struggled to relate to my peers and battled feelings of isolation and depression.

Now in my mid-20s and still unable to find purpose or meaning in my life, those feelings have only intensified. I've started to realize this power of mine may be more of a curse. While everyone else finds connection and intimacy in relationships and life's simple pleasures, I remain detached and unfulfilled. I questioned why I was given such a gift in the first place. What's the point of being able to go anywhere in the world instantly if you have no one to share the experience with and no sense of purpose to guide you?

Depressed and unsatisfied with life's ironies, I decide one night to end it all by looking up to the stars and teleporting as far as I could from this world. I gazed up into the night sky, focusing on the faint glimmer of a distant star at the edge of the Milky Way, and felt the familiar rushing sensation of teleporting to an unknown destination.

I expected death to greet me, but instead I found myself floating in a vast expanse of inky blackness dotted with brilliant lights in strange constellations  I didn't recognize. My heart raced as realized what I had done - I had transported myself far beyond our solar system to somewhere deep in uncharted space. Earth was nowhere in sight, but rather than panic, a strange sense of peace descended upon me. 

My failed suicide attempt had landed me here, untethered in the furthest reaches of  space, liberated from the burdens of my lonely existence on Earth. For the first time, gazing out at the wonders of the universe, I felt a profound sense of belonging I had never known. My power had brought me to the only place I might escape my sadness and isolation. Though far from home, I knew this was where I was meant to be. The stars had called me here to save me. I smiled, took a deep breath, and floated gently into the welcoming abyss.
