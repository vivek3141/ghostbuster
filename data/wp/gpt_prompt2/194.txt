In a world where justice was dictated by words that rang, a peculiar law stood tall. It proclaimed that if you could rhyme, your crimes would dissolve, no matter how bitter or small.
Within the grand chambers of a crowded court, a man named Will stood with a weary heart. Accused of theft, he faced a trial unjust, his fate hanging on his words, an eloquent art.
The judge, stern and stoic, emphasized the law, "As long as you rhyme, no sentence shall fall. Your crimes, if provoked for your self-defense, shall be pardoned, as justice we enthrall."
Will, his mind racing, words dancing in his head, knew his rhyme alone could save his life's thread. With bated breath, he began his defense, weaving a tale of struggle with each word he bred.
"Dear court, I stood atop that fateful hill, a humble man, lacking strength but filled with will. A stranger approached, malice set in their eyes, seeking to harm me, a life they would kill."
He continued, painting scenes of desperation and fright, his rhymes carrying the weight of his plight. The court leaned in, captivated by his tale, their interest growing with every verse recited right.
"I grabbed a rock, my only true defense, and fought back against my foe's malevolence. In that despair, amidst the shadowed night, I battled not for riches but to save my innocence."
As his story unfolded with poetic grace, the burden of judgment lifted from Will's face. His rhymes resonated, truth in every line, until the court's final verdict he embraced.
The judge, eyes gleaming with remorse and regret, acknowledged the law's merit and its peculiar set. With a voice trembling, he declared Will free, for his words had painted a picture no one could forget.
In a world where justice was doused in rhyme, Will emerged victorious from the depths of his crime. And though the law seemed odd and strange to all, it granted him life, forever silencing his chains of time.
So here ends the tale of a man who prevailed, enchanted by verse where his destiny was unveiled. As long as you rhyme, defense in court would thrive, a poetic salvation, a triumph for all lives.
