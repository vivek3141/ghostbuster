Once upon a wicked night, in a land so dreary,
Lived a villainous doctor named Dr. McClary.
He resided in a house so ominous and bleak,
Where chaos and torment were all he sought to seek.
With a mind so twisted, his heart black as night,
Dr. McClary spread fear with all of his might.
His words were like venom, his touch turned to ice,
Leaving behind a trail of sorrow and silent cries.
In a small town nearby, the Whos lived in fear,
Their dreams shattered, their hope nowhere near.
Dr. McClary loved their pain, reveled in their plight,
A sadistic pleasure that consumed him day and night.
With a concoction of madness, he brewed up a plan,
To forever darken the land of the Whos, oh so grand.
He crafted a cursed potion, a potion most vile,
To steal away their happiness, ruin their smiles.
With wicked glee, Dr. McClary went door to door,
Forcing the potion upon each Who, from ceiling to floor.
Their laughter turned hollow, happiness faded away,
As darkness and despair became their only stay.
The Whos, once joyous, now wept in dismay,
Their world consumed, hearts heavy with decay.
But one little Who, brave and bright as a star,
Dared to challenge the doctor, to undo his scar.
With hope in her eyes, she ventured through the night,
Looking for a way to end their torment, their plight.
She stood before Dr. McClary, fearless and true,
Demanding he release her people from his sadistic brew.
In a twisted twist, the doctor laughed and he sneered,
Revealing his true plan, his sinister veneer.
He whispered in her ear, with a voice so grim,
"You cannot defeat me, for darkness lies within."
But the little Who, refusing to let evil prevail,
Dug deep within herself, her courage would not fail.
With strength and love, she broke the curse's spell,
Returning joy and light to the world where Whos dwell.
And so, the nightmare ended, the darkness was banished,
Dr. McClary's reign of terror forever vanished.
The Whos learned the power of hope and resilience,
From the twisted tale of Dr. McClary's malevolence.
