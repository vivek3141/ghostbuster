In a land of shadows, where whispers reside,
There lived a secret, the world couldn't hide.
It whispered its tale to the trees in the night,
A story so sacred, a glimmer of light.
A secret worth telling, about love's sweet embrace,
How it bloomed and it flourished, with elegance and grace.
Two souls intertwined, destined to meet,
Their hearts intertwined, united and complete.
Amidst the chaos, they found their solace,
A love so profound, nothing could erase.
It danced in their laughter, it echoed in their song,
A secret so powerful, the world would long.
With each passing day, their secret grew,
In the twinkle of their eyes, the world knew.
Their love was a beacon, a guiding star,
A secret worth telling, no matter how far.
But secrets are fragile, like pages in the wind,
They yearn to be set free, their true selves chagrined.
So they confided their secret, with hearts full of pride,
To a world that embraced them, with love deep and wide.
Now their once-hidden secret blossoms and grows,
Spreading love's essence, wherever it goes.
For a secret worth telling, is a joy shared by all,
And in the telling, love will forever enthral.
