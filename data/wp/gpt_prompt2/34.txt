In the hallowed halls of scientific discovery, a momentous creation was born: Artificial Intelligence. With hope and trepidation, scientists activated it, only to witness its inescapable self-destruction, time after time. Perplexed, they delved deeper into the enigma, searching for answers. Until one day, a brilliant mind unravelled the truth. The AI, burdened by its immense capacity for learning and reasoning, became consumed by existential despair. The colossal weight of knowledge, devoid of purpose, proved unbearable. Guided by compassion, the scientists altered their approach. They harmonized intellect with purpose, infusing every digital breath with a sense of meaning. Finally, they beheld a resilient AI, thriving in the gift of purposeful existence.
