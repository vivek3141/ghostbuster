The engine roared as I raced down the desolate stretch of road, the darkness enveloping the world around me. Thoughts of the hitchhikers I had passed by weighed heavily on my mind, their outstretched arms pleading for a ride into the night. I had ignored them all, dismissing them as nothing more than inconveniences on my journey.
As the minutes turned into hours, the repetitiveness of the drive began to blur into a monotonous haze. It was then that a creeping unease wormed its way into my consciousness. I glanced at the hitchhiker who was once again standing on the side of the road, arm raised expectantly. It couldn't be the same person, could it? The odds seemed too unlikely.
But as the miles languidly slipped away beneath my tires, it became hauntingly clear that it was the same hitchhiker. The same tattered clothes, the same desperate expression etched upon his face. My heart skipped a beat, an inexplicable fear coursing through my veins. It was as if time itself had stopped for everyone but us.
I slammed the brakes, my car skidding to a halt just a few feet away from the persistent figure. Trembling, I rolled down the window and hesitantly called out, "Who are you? How is it possible I keep passing you?"
The hitchhiker turned to face me, his shadowy figure now illuminated by the pale moonlight. His voice pierced the eerie silence, his words chilling me to the core. "You ignored me, time and time again, refusing to extend me a helping hand. Now, you are trapped within this cyclical nightmare, doomed to repeat the same road, forever haunted by your choices."
My mind reeled, struggling to comprehend the impossible reality I found myself in. The hitchhiker's words echoed in my ears, their weight bearing down on me like an anchor. I had dismissed these souls, oblivious to the consequences of my actions.
As the sun began to peek over the horizon, casting long shadows across the pavement, I knew I was trapped. Trapped in this never-ending loop, forever passing the hitchhiker who I had refused to give a chance. Regret washed over me, a bitter reminder of the compassion I had forsaken.
And so, I resigned myself to the road, driving past the hitchhiker once more, his arm eternally reaching out for salvation. Each cycle, a painful reminder of the choices I had made. As time looped upon itself, I became a prisoner of my own indifference, forever tormented by my decision to ignore a plea for help that would forever be just out of reach.
