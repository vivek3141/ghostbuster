Maria woke up early one Sunday morning to find the sun's golden rays gently streaming through her bedroom window. A curious feeling of anticipation filled her as she got out of bed and made her way to the kitchen. Today was going to be an extraordinary day, and she had a breakfast appointment with a God.
As she prepared a simple breakfast of toast and scrambled eggs, Maria couldn't help but wonder how this divine encounter would unfold. Would this God be a mighty deity? Or a humble, unassuming being? She tried to temper her expectations, reminding herself that gods came in various forms. Nevertheless, her heart raced with excitement.
Sitting at the kitchen table with her breakfast, Maria's thoughts were interrupted by a dazzling light emanating from the doorway. In walked a figure draped in radiant, celestial robes. Maria gasped in awe. It was a God, indeed.
The God, however, did not exude overwhelming power. Rather, their aura seemed serene and comforting. They seated themselves across from Maria, delicately accepting a cup of tea she had prepared.
As they indulged in breakfast conversation, the God listened intently to Maria's dreams, fears, and desires. They spoke of the beauty they saw in the world and shared stories of their own moments of awe. It was a deeply personal, intimate exchange, full of profound insights and genuine laughter.
During their shared meal, Maria realized that Gods didn't have to be distant, untouchable beings. Instead, they could be compassionate listeners and loyal friends. This particular God did not seek worship but reveled in the simple joys of human connection.
As breakfast drew to an end, Maria felt both inspired and uplifted by the God's presence. With a gentle smile, the God thanked her for the delightful meal and bid her farewell, leaving Maria with a renewed sense of purpose and a heart brimming with gratitude.
As the kitchen returned to its usual peaceful state, Maria knew that this experience would forever stay with her. She learned that Gods could be found in unexpected encounters and that the divine lived within the everyday moments. From that day forward, Maria carried a piece of that divine light, reminding her to appreciate the magic that exists even in the simplest of breakfasts.
