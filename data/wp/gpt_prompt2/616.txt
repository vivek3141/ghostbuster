In the dark, rain-soaked streets of Gotham City, Batman engaged in the final showdown with his arch-nemesis, The Joker. For years, the Caped Crusader had tirelessly pursued the deranged clown, determined to bring an end to his reign of chaos and terror. As the two adversaries clashed amidst the ruins of an abandoned carnival, Batman realized with a sinking feeling that he desperately needed to relieve himself.
The pressure in his bladder grew, making it increasingly difficult for him to focus on the fight. Every punch he threw was accompanied by a wince, every evaded attack by a clenched buttock. The Joker, sensing Batman's discomfort, cackled maniacally, taking advantage of the Dark Knight's distracted state.
Meanwhile, Commissioner Gordon and the police force watched the battle from a distance, providing backup when needed. Gordon observed Batman's increasingly awkward movements and confused expression. He discreetly radioed one of his officers, instructing them to locate the nearest public restroom and prepare it for Batman's arrival.
The fight raged on, each blow fueling Batman's urge to find relief. With persistence and determination, he managed to outmaneuver The Joker, finally delivering a punch that sent the villain sprawling across the wet pavement.
As Batman stood victorious over his fallen foe, he briefly closed his eyes, attempting to suppress the inevitable. But the urgency gnawed at him, refusing to be ignored. Knowing he couldn't delay any longer, Batman made a swift exit, leaving the bewildered Joker behind.
With the help of the police, Batman was guided to the nearby public restroom, the urgency growing more intense with every step. In a hidden alcove, away from prying eyes, he quickly donned his civilian disguise, Bruce Wayne.
Entering the restroom, Bruce Wayne found it mercifully empty. He hurriedly made his way towards a vacant stall, sighing with relief as he finally sat down, forgetting the world outside for just a few moments.
As he sat, contemplating the nature of heroism and the toll it could take on even the most formidable crime fighter, he couldn't help but chuckle at the irony of the situation. Even Batman, the stoic guardian of Gotham City, was human, with ordinary bodily functions that demanded attention.
Emerging from the stall, Bruce Wayne once again donned the cape and cowl of Batman. He rejoined Commissioner Gordon and the police, ready to continue his duties as the city's protector. The Joker had been apprehended, Gotham City was safe, and Batman had attended to an entirely different kind of emergency.
Though the world may never know of the personal sacrifices Batman made, the citizens rested peacefully, unaware of the tremendous relief tucked away within the shadows.
And so, Gotham City declared another victory, blissfully ignorant of the brief interlude when Batman's most pressing battle became something of a less heroic nature.
