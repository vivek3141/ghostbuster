In a world ravaged by fear, a bond between mother and daughter emerged amidst the chaos. The first time she called me "mama," my heart soared with love and hope. With every passing day, we forged an unbreakable connection, braving the harsh realities together. But darkness loomed over our happiness.
They labeled her a violent monster, a threat to society. I fought relentlessly to prove her innocence, but their twisted judgment prevailed. The last time she called me "mama," tears streamed down my face knowing it may be our final exchange. As they carried out her execution, love and heartbreak melded into an unyielding acheâ€”a sorrow only a mother could endure.
