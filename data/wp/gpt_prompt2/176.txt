In a world where legends breathed fire, I was born with the gift to possess dragons. These magnificent creatures had always fascinated me, but now they were mine to command. With a whisper, my consciousness merged with theirs, and we became one, soaring through the skies. Together, we brought warmth to frozen lands, rain to parched deserts, and hope to weary hearts. But power comes with a priceâ€”I was consumed by the immense responsibility of protecting both dragons and humans. Their destinies intertwined, I vowed to nurture a bond of trust that would forever honor these majestic beings and their mythical existence.
