In the darkest depths of the underworld, Modor the Destructor brooded over his unprecedented might. This diabolical force, capable of obliterating entire galaxies, was fueled by an unexpected source—a curious 2-year-old child. Modor pondered the irony—the sheer absurdity that his immeasurable power sprang forth from such innocence. The child's innocent interrogations seeped into Modor's consciousness, causing him to question his own existence. Was it worth destroying worlds, just to maintain this power? As Modor watched the child wander through its innocuous exploration, he was plagued by doubt, wondering if perhaps he was destined for a different path, away from destruction and towards enlightenment.
