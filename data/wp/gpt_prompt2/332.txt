In the golden haze of memory's embrace,
A childhood realm of innocence and grace.
Laughter echoed like birds taking flight,
Bathed in dawn's soft, ethereal light.
Summer days were an endless game,
Lost in the fields, no two the same.
Barefoot adventures, wild and free,
Chasing dreams beneath the old oak tree.
Nana's cookies, sweet and warm,
A fragrant haven from life's storm.
Her gentle touch, a lullaby,
Rocking me to sleep under starry sky.
Days of wonder and imaginations wild,
Where dreams were born, undefiled.
Childhood's memory, forever pure,
A treasure trove, eternally secure.
