Alice's eyes flickered open as the room began to fill with pale morning light. For a moment, she lay in bed, disoriented and groggy. But then, her mind snapped into focus as she noticed the digital clock on her bedside table—5:01 AM. Alarm bells rang in her head, and a disturbing realization gnawed at her. She was awake during the forbidden hour.
Without wasting a second, Alice sprang out of bed, adrenaline coursing through her veins. As she stumbled towards her dresser, a holographic message materialized in the air before her. A stern-faced military officer looked down upon her. "Report to your local military base. Basic training begins now," the message read, its words burning into Alice's mind.
Confusion mingled with fear, but deep within her, a sense of duty compelled her forward. She hastily dressed, struggling to comprehend her abrupt summons. How did she possess the rare ability to awaken during the forbidden hour? And why did it coincide with a summons from the military?
With resolve in her heart, Alice hurried through the silent streets. As she approached the military base, the morning mist enshrouded the towering gates, adding an eerie atmosphere to her already tumultuous thoughts. Uncertainty weighed heavily on her shoulders, but she knew she needed to embrace whatever lay ahead.
Inside the base, Alice found herself among a select few individuals who possessed the same ability as hers—a small but fiercely determined group that had the extraordinary power to defy their programming. They were humanity's last line of defense during the forbidden hour.
As the crack of dawn painted the sky, Alice realized that this was the moment she had unknowingly prepared for her entire life. The path ahead would be fraught with danger, but she was ready to stand against the unknown horrors lurking in the early hours of morning.
