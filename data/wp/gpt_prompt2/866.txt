Hi! I'm the main character! Or so you would have me be. I want you to know that no matter what you write, I refuse to be the main character in your little game and will avoid any instance where you try to put me into a situation that does so.
In a world filled with heroes and villains, I chose to walk a different path. I watched as the heroes fought valiant battles, sacrificing everything to save the day. But I couldn't see myself as one of them, nor did I desire to be.
While epic quests and grand adventures unfolded around me, I found solace in the quiet corners of life. In the everyday moments, the unsung heroes, and the tiny acts of kindness that often went unnoticed.
I followed a path that led me away from the spotlight, seeking meaning in simple gestures and quiet contemplation. My story became about the lives I touched, rather than the battles I fought.
So, dear writer, no matter how much you may try, I shall forever evade the role of the main character in your grand narrative. For my story lies in the whispers of forgotten tales, where unsung heroes like me find their purpose - in the shadows, amidst the backdrop of a larger world.
