Death sat in the worn armchair next to the old man, their presence a comfort amid the fading twilight. Week after week, they shared stories of life, memories of youth, and reflections on mortality. Death had been a gentle companion, patiently guiding the old man through the musings of his soul. But tonight, sorrow filled Death's gaze, for they knew that their next visit would bring the end. With a heavy heart, Death struggled to find the words to break the news. They longed to shield the old man from the truth, to hold onto these cherished moments just a little longer.
