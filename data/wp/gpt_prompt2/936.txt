When I was fifteen, deeply infatuated with my girlfriend Lily, I promised her that I would always be there for her whenever she needed me. Little did I know that the powerful goddess Aphrodite overheard my words and decided to make it a reality. From that moment on, whenever Lily found herself in need, I would magically appear by her side.
For the first few weeks, my newfound ability seemed like a blessing. Whenever she needed support or a helping hand, I would materialize and offer my assistance. It felt incredible to have this connection with someone, to be able to offer unwavering support. But as often happens with young love, our relationship quickly crumbled. After just three weeks, Lily and I parted ways.
Yet, despite our breakup, I continued to appear whenever she needed me. At first, it was confusing and even somewhat amusing. Lily would call for help, and there I would be, seemingly out of thin air. She would scream and run away, thinking I was some sort of delusion. No matter how many times she moved or changed her phone number, I always found her when she found herself in need.
Over time, the confusion turned into frustration. Lily had moved on with her life, and so had I. I had my own dreams and plans, yet this mystical connection continued to bind us. No matter where I was or what I was doing, when Lily needed help, my presence would interrupt my life.
As the years went by, this ability became more of a burden than a gift. I couldn't hold down a steady job because I would disappear whenever Lily was in need, only to reappear when the crisis was resolved. Relationships became impossible, too. No one wants to be with a person who randomly vanishes.
Ten years had passed since Lily and I had broken up, and yet we remained connected in this bizarre, invisible bond. Though she had long since moved on, married, and started a family, I was still present whenever she reached out for help.
One day, my patience reached its limit. I found myself at Lily's doorstep again, during a pivotal moment in my own life. I couldn't take it anymore. I needed answers, closure, and the chance to move on.
As I stood outside her house, a mix of anger, sadness, and confusion filled my heart. I knocked on the door, bracing myself for the encounter. Lily opened it, a mix of surprise and annoyance on her face. But this time, instead of running away, she invited me in.
We talked for hours. I poured out my frustration, and she shared her guilt. We realized that our link wasn't just a curse for me, but also a weight on her shoulders. She had spent years feeling guilty for dragging me into her life whenever she needed help.
Together, we came to a decision. We visited a renowned oracle who had a reputation for communicating with the gods. The oracle explained to us that the connection between us had become a source of imbalance in the divine realms, too.
With the oracle's guidance, we made an offering to Aphrodite, expressing our mutual desire to sever the connection. As the flames rose, we released all the emotions we had carried for each other. The fire consumed them, returning us to the people we were meant to be.
When the flames died down, I found myself standing alone, finally free from the invisible shackles that had plagued me for ten long years. Lily and I smiled at each other, knowing that our paths, once deeply intertwined, now led in separate directions.
