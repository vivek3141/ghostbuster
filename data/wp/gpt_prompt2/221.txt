Once upon a time, hidden amongst the darkest corners of society, there lived a seemingly ordinary individual named Ethan. Little did the world know, he harbored a sinister secret. Ethan was a serial killer, an artist of death, and his dark endeavors had finally come to a halt when he was apprehended by the authorities.
As he sat in the cold, sterile interrogation room, Ethan could sense the tension in the air. The detectives stared at him, their eyes a mirror reflecting his twisted psyche. With a soft chuckle, he leaned back in his chair, ready to comply with their morbid request.
"The first kill, you say?" Ethan's voice was eerily calm, betraying the malevolence within. Memories began flooding his mind, resurrecting the chilling event.
"It was a gloomy autumn evening," he began, "awash in a cascade of fading leaves. She was my muse, my canvas on which to paint my masterpiece."
The detectives leaned in, captivated by the macabre details.
"I lured her to a secluded forest, a symphony of silence enveloping us. Her bewitching fear danced harmoniously with my excitement. As the moon's silver embrace bathed us, her life force slowly seeped away beneath my hands."
A shudder ran through the detectives, but Ethan remained unperturbed. He continued his tale, relishing the opportunity to recount his darkest memory.
"Afterward, as her vacant eyes stared into the abyss, I finally understood the sweet thrill that accompanied each taken breath. The very essence of power, control, and the duality of life and death."
His voice faded, leaving behind a vacuum of uncomfortable silence. The detectives exchanged glances, horrified by the depths of Ethan's depravity.
"I'm an artist of demise, you see," he concluded with a chilling grin, "and my first kill was just the commencement of my haunting masterpiece that forever echoes through the shadows."
And with that, the room was consumed by an unsettling stillness, as they all knew that the nightmare was far from over.
