In a world filled with peculiar happenings, I found myself endowed with a most unusual ability. Whenever someone took part in a private moment of pleasure with thoughts of me, a disconcerting notification appeared on my phone. At first, it amused meâ€”curiosity piqued, I wondered who these fervent admirers were. But as time passed, the constant buzzing barrage became tiresome and invasive. Desperate for relief, I made a wish on a shooting star one night. The following day, my phone remained silent. Free from any intrusive interruptions, I embraced newfound solace and reveled in the blissful quiet, forever grateful for the fleeting anonymity.
