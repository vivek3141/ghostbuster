Sure! Here's a draft for your 400-word story:
As John finished his business in the bathroom, he approached the sink to clean his hands. As he leaned over and glanced at the mirror, he noticed something peculiar. His reflection seemed slightly off, as if it was moving independently of him. His heart skipped a beat, and he squinted, trying to make sense of it. 
He splashed some water onto his hands and then reached for the soap. As he rubbed his hands together vigorously, he continued to steal glances at the mirror. The reflection's movements were subtle, but definitely out of sync with his own. A chill ran down John's spine, and he thought that maybe he had just caught a glimpse of his imagination playing tricks on him.
Nonetheless, curiosity got the better of him. He stared intently at the mirror, his hand frozen midair, his soapy fingers momentarily forgotten. The reflection of his face contorted into a sinister grin, while his genuine smile remained unchanged. Panic surged through his veins, and he hastily retreated, slipping backwards, knocking the soap dispenser to the floor.
John's heart pounded in his chest as he stepped away from the mirror. He was unsure of what he had just witnessed. How could his reflection move independently? He cautiously approached the mirror once again, raising his hand slowly to his face. His reflection, however, lifted an eyebrow mockingly. 
Fear mingled with curiosity compelled John to experiment further. He brought his hand down abruptly, only to see his reflection copy the movement but slightly delayed. It was as if he was watching a distorted version of himself in slow motion. John's mind raced, unable to comprehend the bizarre phenomenon he was experiencing.
With determination, John decided to confront his reflection. He stood upright, staring deep into the eyes of his mirrored self, challenging its existence. Suddenly, his reflection smirked and parted its lips unnaturally wide, revealing rows of sharp, jagged teeth.
John recoiled in horror, stumbling backward, desperately trying to put distance between himself and the grotesque image in the mirror. He felt a mix of disbelief and terror, questioning his sanity. No longer able to bear the eerie presence, he turned and fled the bathroom, leaving his reflection locked away behind the door.
Leaning against the hallway wall, catching his breath, John's mind raced with confusion. Had his eyes deceived him? Was it a trick of the light? Or had he stumbled upon a supernatural occurrence? Regardless, one thing was certain: John was almost too afraid to ever look at his reflection again.
