Sure, here's a 200-word story based on the given prompt:
Every day in my marriage to Captain Obvious is nothing short of an adventure. From the moment we wake up until we retire for the night, there is never a dull moment. 
In the morning, as the sun spills its golden rays into our room, Captain Obvious, true to his name, announces, "Good morning, it's a new day!" Though some may find this unnecessary, I have come to appreciate his unwavering enthusiasm. It sets the tone for our day of surprises.
Over breakfast, Captain Obvious points out the obvious, "The toast is hot," and "The coffee is black." He never fails to turn ordinary moments into extraordinary observations, making me smile despite the mundanity of daily routines.
As we move through our day, Captain Obvious's commentary continues. In the park, surrounded by chirping birds and budding flowers, he remarks, "It's a nice day for a walk." Funny as it may seem, his words remind me to appreciate the beauty in the simplest of things.
In the evening, as we sit together on the couch, Captain Obvious poses the question, "We are lucky to have each other, aren't we?" It's in these moments that I realize his knack for stating the obvious is his way of expressing love and gratitude for our partnership.
As we settle into bed, Captain Obvious whispers, "I love you." It may be evident, but his words are a gentle reminder of the profound love that we share.
And so, in my marriage to Captain Obvious, every day is a celebration of life's ordinary wonders, reminding me to see the world through a different lens. With him by my side, I know that no matter how predictable or obvious life may seem, there will always be room for discovery, joy, and love.
