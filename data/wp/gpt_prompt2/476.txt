Once upon a time, I believed in magic. It filled my dreams, fueling hope and wonder. But that fateful day shattered my innocence. As I stumbled upon my grandfather's dusty attic, I discovered a hidden trunk, unveiling secrets long forgotten. Among old journals and arcane relics, a letter revealed the truth. "My dear child," it began, "magic is a wistful tale, woven to spark imagination. It exists solely within our hearts, where dreams thrive if we allow them to. Embrace the joy in the ordinary, for that is where true magic resides." With trembling hands, I embraced a new reality, forever grateful to have found magic within myself.
