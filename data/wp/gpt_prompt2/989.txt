Sure! Here's a draft of a 200-word story based on the prompt:
The annual disaster training at our company was usually filled with mundane safety drills and monotonous lectures, so as a joke, I decided to create a Zombie Apocalypse Plan. Little did I know that the laughter it brought would soon turn into nervous glances when disturbing news reports of actual zombies began to circulate.
As panic gripped our office, my co-workers turned to me, the accidental expert on the subject. They demanded to see my plan for salvation. I gulped, realizing the gravity of the situation. With a trembling hand, I retrieved the document from my desk and spread it out for everyone to see.
The plan outlined various stages of defense and escape, highlighting essential supplies and safe meeting points. Sweat formed on my brow as my colleagues pored over each detail, their eyes wide with both dread and hope.
Despite my initial skepticism, it appeared that my sarcastic masterpiece was strikingly accurate in addressing potential threats and potential escape routes. With newfound determination, we hastily assembled emergency kits, armed with whatever makeshift weapons we could find in the office.
As the distant sounds of groaning grew louder, we locked the office doors and barricaded ourselves inside. My heart raced with both fear and a strange sense of pride. The fate of our lives now rested on a joke that I never imagined would come to life.
As the first zombie clawed at our door, I took a deep breath and rallied my co-workers. "Remember, we're a team. We can survive this. Just follow the plan!"
We may have started with a joke, but now it was up to us to turn the tables and survive the nightmarish reality outside.
