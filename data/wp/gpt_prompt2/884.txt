Sure! Here's a 100-word story based on the prompt:
Samantha possessed a peculiar bag, one that offered precisely what she needed at any given moment. But lately, the bag's contents had taken a mysterious turn. One evening, while searching for her sunglasses, she reached in, only to retrieve a pair of night-vision goggles. Bewildered, she placed them aside. Days passed, and her bag bestowed a pocket dictionary just before a competitive spelling bee, and a compass on a routine hike. However, when Samantha dipped her hand in next, she pulled out a crystal ball. Examining its mystical depths, she realized her future was in her own hands; she no longer needed the bag's assistance.
