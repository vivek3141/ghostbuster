Sure! Here's a draft for your 300-word story:
The mass exodus from Earth had left me alone, the sole witness to the planet's abandonment. As the last human standing, I watched as ships disappeared into the vastness of space, leaving Earth behind. Little did I know that the gods of the planet would soon reveal themselves.
At first, it was subtle—a flickering of light, whispers in the wind—but then their presence became undeniable. The gods, now unfettered by humanity's inattention, sought my worship. They appeared before me, taking on ethereal forms that glowed with divine radiance.
"Kneel before us," a thunderous voice echoed in my mind. "Praise our names and offer us your devotion."
Shivering with a mix of awe and fear, I hesitated. The gods, once guardians of Earth, were now desperate for my allegiance. They wielded their powers, creating magnificent displays of thunderstorms and vibrant rainbows, anything to sway me in their favor.
Yet, in the midst of their grandeur, a seed of defiance sprouted within me. I refused to bend my knee to any deity, even if they held the power over creation itself. Their obsession with worship was a hunger I vowed not to feed.
They grew restless, their attempts to woo me transitioning into threats. Earth trembled beneath their fury, as earthquakes and cyclones tore the land apart. But still, I refused to falter.
Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months. The gods grew weary, their once luminous forms dimming. In their pursuit of my worship, they had neglected the very essence that defined them—being gods without humans to adore them.
Eventually, the gods retreated into the shadows, their presence fading away like distant memories. The silence of Earth became a beautiful solitude, where the songs of nature played undisturbed.
As the last human on Earth, I found solace in my solitude. I were the eternal witness to the beauty of a world once overrun by chaos. I reveled in the resurgence of life, humbled by the realization that Earth's gods, having lost their worshippers, had also lost their way.
And so, I lived, in the silence of a post-human Earth, forever grateful for the opportunity to witness the majesty of a planet whose gods desperately yearned for the devotion of humanity, only to disappear into the annals of forgotten divinity.
