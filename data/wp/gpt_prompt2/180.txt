In the deserted remnants of a once-thriving city, a solitary figure stood. Dusk settled, casting long shadows across empty streets. The last person on Earth stood at the edge of an abandoned power station, contemplating their final act. With a heavy heart but resolute determination, they reached for the control panel, their trembling hand hovering above the switch. As memories of laughter and whispers of forgotten lives echoed in their mind, they closed their eyes and whispered a farewell to humanity. With a flick, the lights dimmed and darkness engulfed a world left behind, marking their somber departure from a life once lived.
