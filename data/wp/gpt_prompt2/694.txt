Title: The Final Farewell
Word Count: 900
It was a somber autumn morning when Maggie stood at the edge of an old wooden pier, staring out at the calm, unforgiving waves. A sense of both resignation and anticipation filled her as she clutched a weathered letter in her trembling hands. This was where it would all end. 
She couldn't help but replay the events of the past year in her mind, like a broken record that refused to stop. It had all begun with a chance encounter on this very pier, when she first met Ethan. The bond they swiftly formed was undeniable, forged with shared laughter and whispered secrets. They had embarked on a journey filled with stolen kisses and laughter-fueled nights, knowing deep down that it would only last until the end of summer.
Maggie, a free-spirited artist, had fallen head over heels for Ethan, a charming writer. Their love thrived on stolen moments and intense passion, knowing that the world refused to let them be together. As fall approached, the reality of their impending separation loomed, dark clouds casting shadows over what had once been an ethereal romance.
It was during a crisp evening stroll on the pier when Ethan had revealed the heartbreaking truth. He was diagnosed with a terminal illness, one that promised only agony and a rapidly dwindling clock. Maggie had been devastated, her world crumbling around her. But Ethan, in his infinite wisdom and selflessness, had made a decision that would forever alter the course of their lives.
Now, standing on the same pier under the overcast sky, Maggie found herself yearning for his presence more than ever. She unfolded the letter Ethan had left her, his handwriting delicate and shaky. As she scanned the words, her heart simultaneously broke and soared.
He had revealed the ending, the final chapter, right from the beginning. Ethan had decided that he would end his own life to spare Maggie the pain of watching him suffer. Unbeknownst to her, he had set everything in motion, meticulous in orchestrating his grand exit.
Maggie shuddered, tears streaming down her face, as she realized that the man she loved would soon slip away from her forever. But Ethan had made a vow to himself, to give Maggie one last beautiful memory before he closed the chapter on his life.
The letter detailed a scavenger hunt, a series of clues that would lead Maggie to places they had shared their most cherished memories. Each location held a piece of their story, a reminder of the love they had found and the laughter they had shared. Maggie clung to this mission, knowing that it was their last voyage together.
With a heavy heart and anticipation coursing through her veins, she embarked on the scavenger hunt, traveling through the familiar streets of their town. Each clue pulled her closer to the next, memories and emotions intertwining.
She arrived at their favorite caf√©, where they had spent countless afternoons engrossed in conversations about art and literature. The second clue guided her to the park, the place where they had their first picnic under a willow tree, laughing and promising forever.
The final clue led her back to the pier, the very spot where she had first encountered Ethan. As the sun began to dip below the horizon, casting a fiery glow across the water, Maggie finally understood. This was where they would say their ultimate goodbye.
Tears blurred her vision as she imagined Ethan's ethereal presence, standing beside her. She could almost feel his arms wrap around her, his whispered promises of eternal love floating on the wind. Maggie closed her eyes, taking in the taste of their final kiss, savoring every bittersweet moment.
In that fleeting instance, even as the story reached its destined end, Maggie found solace in knowing that their love would forever remain suspended in time. The ending had been revealed, but the mystery and suspense of their love story would linger, eternally captivating her heart.
As the final rays of sunlight disappeared, she whispered her farewell to Ethan, her love for him transcending the boundaries of life and death. The pier, the witnesses of their grand finale, stood in silence as Maggie let go of his memory, knowing that though their story had come to a close, their love would endure, even beyond the last page.
As she turned to walk away, a single tear fell from her eyes, mingling with the saltwater from the ocean below, a testament to a love that defied time.
