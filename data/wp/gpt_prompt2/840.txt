In the vast expanse of eternity, an immortal wandered, consumed by an unbearable longing. Bound by immortality, they yearned for the touch of Death, their eternal love. Endless centuries passed, and the immortal sought desperately for an escape from their endless existence. They scaled the highest mountains, seeking solace in the depths of the ocean, and plunged into the heart of roaring fires, but to no avail. Determined, they delved into forbidden knowledge, seeking a forbidden spell. With trembling hands, the immortal invoked the incantation, sacrificing their very essence, desperate to be reunited with Death. And as their final breath escaped their lips, Death appeared, their embrace finally eternal.
