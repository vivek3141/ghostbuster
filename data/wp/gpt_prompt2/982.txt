Once upon a time, in a small town called Millbrook, lived a little boy named Oliver. Oliver was an imaginative child with a great disdain for homework. He found it boring and time-consuming, taking him away from his real passion - exploring the mysteries of the world. 
One gloomy evening, as he sat grumbling over his math assignment, Oliver stumbled across an ancient book in the depths of his attic. It was bound in tattered leather, its pages yellowed with age. Intrigued, Oliver began flipping through the delicate pages until he stumbled upon a peculiar spell.
"This must be magic," Oliver thought mischievously. "What if I could get out of doing my homework?" Without thinking twice, he started uttering the words, and the room filled with an eerie silence.
Suddenly, a puff of smoke appeared in front of Oliver, slowly dissipating to reveal a hideous creature. The demon had jet-black wings, razor-sharp claws, and fiery red eyes that sent shivers down Oliver's spine. Its voice was deep and menacing.
"You have summoned me, mortal," the demon bellowed. "What is your desire?"
Oliver hesitated, momentarily regretting his impulsive decision. However, conjuring up all his courage, he spoke. "I, uh, I want you to do my homework for me, demon."
The demon's fiery eyes narrowed, its lips curling into a wicked grin. "Very well, child. But remember, everything comes at a price."
The demon began working on Oliver's homework, its monstrous claws frantically scribbling equations and writing essays. Oliver couldn't believe his luck as he watched the demon masterfully complete the tasks that had seemed impossible earlier.
Days turned into weeks, and Oliver's academic life changed drastically. His grades soared, and his classmates wondered how such a mediocre student had suddenly become a genius. Oliver reveled in his newfound success, but an unsettling feeling gnawed at him.
One evening, as the demon finished another assignment, it turned to Oliver, its red eyes glinting. "The time has come, child. I have fulfilled my part of the deal. But now, I want your soul."
Oliver's heart pounded in his chest. He had been careless and oblivious to the consequences. Trembling, he pleaded with the demon, "Please, there must be something else I can offer you!"
The demon considered Oliver's words for a moment before finally relenting. "Very well. Instead of your soul, I shall take your ability to summon me again."
Relieved, Oliver thanked the demon and watched as it vanished in a puff of smoke, never to be seen again. From that day forward, Oliver learned his lesson. He worked hard on his homework, feeling a sense of accomplishment that stemmed from his own efforts.
And so, Oliver went on to become a successful scholar, cherishing the story of the demon and the lesson it taught him about taking shortcuts in life.
