Once, in a land of eternal frost, there lived a man named Alexander. His heart was vibrant and full of love, until a wicked witch decided to intervene. With a flick of her icy fingers, she stole his warm heart, leaving behind a hollow, frozen void. Now, Alexander's chest harbored ice instead of love. For years, he embraced the coldness, afraid that if he ever loved again, the icy facade would melt away, irreversibly exposing him to pain. His soul yearned for affection, yet he feared the vulnerability it brought. And so, Alexander existed, trapped in an icy realm of loveless solitude.
