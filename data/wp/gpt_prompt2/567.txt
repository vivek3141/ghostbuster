As I stepped out of the time machine, I immediately sensed something was wrong. The air crackled with foreign energies, and the surrounding cityscape looked nothing like the place I had intended to travel to. Panic surged through me as I realized the time machine had malfunctioned, transporting me to an unexpected era.
