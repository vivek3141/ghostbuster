Sure! Here's a draft for your 300-word story:

It started like any other day, but on that morning, the world changed forever. Redditors woke up to discover that they all possessed mutant powers, each ability reflecting the number of upvotes received in their lifetime. The world was about to turn into a chaotic playground of extraordinary abilities.
At the forefront of the global phenomenon were those with the highest upvotes. They discovered their powers were immeasurably strong and impactful. Internet pioneers, like u/InnovatorX, emerged with the ability to manipulate time. With every scroll, they could rewind, fast-forward, and even pause reality. Their upvote count practically gave them control over the universe.
Others achieved superhuman strength like u/MightyLifter, who could lift entire buildings with ease. Their upvotes granted them unrivaled physical prowess, making them legends of the new age. They quickly joined forces, using their combined strength to rebuild cities and protect the weak.
Meanwhile, those with fewer upvotes found their powers to be comically useless. For example, u/FluffySocks discovered they could summon a never-ending supply of socks, causing an avalanche of mismatched footwear. With each useless ability revealed, they formed a community to make light of their misfortune.
As days turned into weeks, the once anonymous Redditors became celebrities, adored and feared depending on their upvote count. Some started using their newfound powers for personal gain, showcasing their abilities through viral videos in exchange for upvotes.
However, the more upvotes one received, the more scrutiny they faced from shadowy organizations seeking to control these powerful beings. Governments, too slow to prevent the chaos unfolding, scrambled to regulate and monitor the Redditor mutants. The world, once full of endless possibilities, was on the verge of collapse.
But throughout the chaos, a small group emerged. They called themselves the "Karma Knights," a collective of Redditors who rejected the divisions caused by upvotes. Together, they used their abilities, whether mighty or negligible, for the greater good of humanity.
As the world teetered on the edge of destruction, the Karma Knights aimed to unite the Redditors, bringing an end to the divisions and reminding them of the power of community. The upvotes that had once caused chaos would become a symbol of unity, forging a new era where abilities were not determined by popularity, but by the strength of the human spirit.
