January 2nd, 2013 - The Day Your Resolution Fails.
Hope clung desperately to the dawn of the new year, but reality soon shattered its fragile grip. With each passing hour, determination waned, and old habits called out hungrily, tempting me to relent. The allure of the familiar proved too strong to resist.
Morning came adorned with promises, a resolution etched deep within my heart, but by the afternoon, it crumbled to dust. A single misstep led to a cascade of excuses, and the resolve I had nurtured became an abandoned dream. Guilt mingled with disappointment as the day ended, leaving my resolution a mere ghost of intention.
