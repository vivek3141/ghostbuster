Ever since he had stumbled upon this wordplay gem, Officer Mitchell had become obsessed. It was such a simple and innocent joke, yet it brought a mischievous glint to his eyes. He couldn't think of a better opportunity than the annual prison talent show to reveal his clever creation.
For weeks, Officer Mitchell meticulously planned his act, his excitement growing with each passing day. He secretly enlisted the help of the prison's carpenter, who crafted a custom stage prop for him. Hidden within this seemingly ordinary wooden box was the culmination of Officer Mitchell's pun.
On the day of the talent show, as the spotlight illuminated the stage, Officer Mitchell nervously held his small-sized wooden box. The audience, consisting of inmates and staff, murmured with anticipation, curious to see what the usually serious prison guard had in store. Officer Mitchell took a deep breath to steady his racing heart.
With a flourish, Officer Mitchell opened the box, revealing a perfectly-sized doll and a crystal ball. "Ladies and gentlemen," he announced, his voice carrying across the room, "I present to you, a small medium at large!"
The room erupted into laughter and applause. The inmates, usually trapped within their circumstances, saw a different side to their stern prison guard, and they relished in the lighthearted moment.

In that moment, Officer Mitchell realized the power of humor and its ability to bridge the gaps between people. He had, in his own way, brought a small measure of freedom to those who were locked away. And as he exited the stage, a feeling of satisfaction washed over him. His pun had been successfully shared, and its impact reached far beyond his expectations.
