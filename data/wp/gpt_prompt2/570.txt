Sure, here's a draft for your 200-word story:
On the triumphant last day of Obama's presidency, a vehicle flies in a streak of fire onto the White House lawn. In a disheveled panic, Bernie Sanders leaps from the DeLorean, shouting dire warnings about the future.
As the crowd gasps in disbelief, Bernie's raspy voice cuts through the chaotic scene. "Listen, everyone! We have to act now, or our democracy will crumble before our very eyes!"
Confusion spreads like wildfire, but the urgency in Bernie's eyes convinces a few brave souls to rally around him. The former president himself steps forward, his hand on Bernie's trembling shoulder. "Tell us, Bernie. What do we need to do?"
Bernie takes a quick breath, his eyes scanning the determined faces in front of him. "We need to unite, regardless of party lines, to protect the rights of all Americans. We cannot let corporate greed and corruption erode our society any further."
With Obama's support, Bernie's words echo through the crowd, igniting a sense of purpose. Senators, representatives, and citizens stand as one, committing to a united front against injustice.
The following years are marked by fierce battles, as Bernie and his newfound allies fight against the political status quo. Together, they combat income inequality, strengthen social safety nets, and pave the way for progressive policies.
Although faced with many obstacles, their unwavering determination yields results. Health care becomes more accessible, education is reformed, and the working class is uplifted.
As Bernie enters the twilight of his political career, he reflects on their accomplishments. The dire warnings he delivered that fateful day spurred a movement that changed the course of history for the better.
And so, amidst cheers and gratitude, Bernie Sanders retires, knowing that his last act as a public servant was to secure a brighter future for generations to come.
