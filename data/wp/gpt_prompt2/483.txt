Sure, here's a draft for your story:
On my 11th birthday, a scientist appeared out of thin air. "Happy birthday!" he exclaimed, interrupting the excitement of my wizarding family. Confused, I approached to find out what this stranger wanted.
"Please, excuse the intrusion," he said, extending his hand. "My name is Dr. Bennett. I'm here to tell you something important."
With curiosity swirling inside me, I shook his hand cautiously. "What is it, Dr. Bennett?"
His voice lowered as he gravely stared into my eyes. "You see, my dear, you were raised in a world of magic and wonder. But I regret to inform you that you have no magical powers."
My heart sank, my dreams of adventures at Hogwarts suddenly shattered. "How can that be?" I stammered, feeling a void within me.
Dr. Bennett sighed sympathetically. "It's rare, but occasionally, wizard families have children without magical abilities. It seems you are one of them. However, there's still hope. You'll have to attend a muggle school, like any other ordinary child."
The news was devastating, yet a spark of determination ignited within me. Hogwarts might be a distant dream, but I refused to let it define my entire existence.
"I will make the most of it," I said with newfound conviction. "I'll embrace the world of science and find wonders in its own magic."
From that day forward, I immersed myself in the realm of muggles, learning about atoms, equations, and the secrets of the natural world. I met new friends, discovered the power of knowledge, and slowly came to appreciate the beauty of science.
As time passed, I grew to understand that magical powers were not the sole definition of a remarkable person. I may have been denied a wand, but I was bestowed with curiosity and an unyielding spirit. And with every scientific discovery, I cast my own spells of wonder and awe.
Though I bid farewell to the wizarding world, I found a new home among the muggles, where science became my true wizardry.
