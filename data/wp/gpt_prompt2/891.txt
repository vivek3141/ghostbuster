As I jolted awake, my roommate's panicked voice cut through the haze of sleep. "There's no time! We have to go!" Confusion clouded my mind as I fumbled for understanding. "What do you mean?" I managed to stammer. Their wide eyes met mine, desperation etched on their face. "There's no time! I woke up today, and time doesn't exist anymore!" As the gravity of their words sank in, an eerie stillness engulfed the room. We exchanged frantic glances, realizing the world as we knew it had been torn asunder. Without hesitation, we grabbed each other's hands, embarking on a journey into the unknown, where time was merely a forgotten concept.
