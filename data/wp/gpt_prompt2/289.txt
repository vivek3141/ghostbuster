Sure! Here's a draft for your 900-word story:
As the rain poured outside, I sat comfortably at home, enjoying a lazy Sunday afternoon. I was sitting on the couch, engrossed in my laptop, aimlessly browsing the internet. The sound of raindrops against my window created a peaceful ambiance, lulling me into relaxation. 
Suddenly, a faint sound caught my attention. It was a woman's cough coming from the room next to me. Confused, I paused my browsing and strained my ears to listen again. There it was, the cough came again, even softer this time.
My curiosity piqued, I cautiously got up from the couch and began moving towards the source of the noise: my study. The cough grew more distinct with each step, driving my intrigue further. I reached the doorway and peered into the dimly lit room, searching for the origin of the sound.
To my surprise, the room was empty. My heart started racing as I hesitantly closed the door behind me. I tried to shake off the nervousness and chalked it up to my imagination running wild. Perhaps the rain outside was playing tricks on my ears.
Returning to the couch, I resumed my internet browsing, determined to distract myself from the strangeness of the situation. However, before long, I heard the cough again. This time, it was louder and nearer, as if the woman was in the hallway right outside my study.
A sense of unease washed over me, and I hesitantly stepped out of the room, leaving my laptop behind. The cough continued intermittently, leading me further into the depths of my home. I followed the sound down the hallway towards the staircase, my pulse quickening with every step.
The cough seemed to echo from the upper level now, urging me to keep on. The staircase creaked beneath me as I ascended, each groan an eerie accompaniment to the mysterious coughing. The upper floor felt colder, the air tinged with a strange heaviness that only heightened my growing trepidation.
I walked towards the familiar sound, drawn to a half-opened door. From within, a soft glow seeped into the hallway, casting flickering shadows on the walls. With shaky hands, I pushed open the door and what I saw took my breath away.
The room was filled with shelves and artifacts, as if it were a museum of ancient relics. But it wasn't the disarrayed variety of objects that caught my attention. It was her. A frail woman, wrapped in a shawl, sat on a wooden chair, coughing and wheezing. Her eyes met mine, filled with infinite weariness and longing.
"Who are you? What are you doing in my house?" I stammered, trying to process the surreal situation.
The woman's cough morphed into a weak chuckle. "This was my house, once upon a time," she said, her voice carrying a tremor of sadness. "But that was years ago. I have been trapped here ever since that fateful day."
Her words sent shivers down my spine as I cautiously approached the woman. Before I could ask any more questions, she vanished into thin air, leaving only an echoing silence behind. Confusion and disbelief flooded my mind, leaving me disoriented.
As I stood there, grappling with what I had just experienced, my eyes locked onto an old photograph lying on a nearby table. It portrayed the same woman, once vibrant and full of life. A chill ran down my spine as I read an accompanying caption:
"Eleanor Thomas, 1925-1950."
Suddenly, the pieces began to fit together. Eleanor Thomas, the previous owner of this house, was tragically known for disappearing without a trace, back in 1950. Her mysterious vanishing had since become local legend, but now, here she was, seeking solace within the confines of her long-lost home.
Trembling, I realized I had been granted a glimpse into the ghostly existence of Eleanor Thomas. She had somehow reached out to me, hoping to find peace and closure. With a newfound empathy, I vowed to uncover the truth behind her untimely disappearance and set her restless spirit free.
And so, my quiet Sunday afternoon transformed into an unexpected adventure, one that not only challenged my skepticism but also taught me the power of compassion, empathy, and the profound impact our actions can have on those who came before us.
