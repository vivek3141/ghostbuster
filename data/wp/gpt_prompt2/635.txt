Sure, here's a draft for you:

At 35, I found myself standing in front of the familiar door of my old dorm room. The paint was faded, and the handle creaked as I mustered the courage to knock. I never imagined that one day I would be desperately seeking the help of my younger self, but here I was, stranded fifteen years in the past.
The time travel experiment I had agreed to participate in had intended to send me back ten years, providing a glimpse into my past and allowing me to correct some mistakes. However, a malfunction had occurred, catapulting me fifteen years instead. As the dizzying array of moments and memories settled in my mind, I realized that I was now a twenty-year-old version of myself, unknowingly visiting my past self.
With no money, no identity, nowhere to stay, and no means of return for the next five years, I had no other choice but to knock on that door, hoping my younger self could somehow assist.
Timidly, I tapped on the door. Seconds passed before it swung open, revealing a younger version of myself with a puzzled expression. The shock on his face mirrored mine as we locked eyes, both of us frozen in time.
"Who... who are you?" my younger self stammered, suspicion evident in his voice.
"I know this sounds crazy, but I am you... but from the future," I hastily explained, my words jumbled with anxiety. "I've been thrown back fifteen years, and I need your help."
We spent hours talking, trying to grasp the reality of what had happened. As we delved into our shared memories and experiences, it became clear that convincing my younger self of the truth wouldn't be easy. After all, it's not every day someone claims to be you from the future.
But slowly, my words resonated with him. The hints and secrets only the real me would know began to alleviate his doubts. With a newfound understanding, my younger self agreed to assist me.
Together, we took each day as it came. My younger self offered me shelter in his cramped dorm room, while I used my future knowledge to guide us through life. I warned him of certain choices and helped him make wiser decisions, trying to minimize the impact on our future self.
Days turned into weeks, weeks into months, and months into years. We adapted to our peculiar situation, our bond as the same person growing immeasurably strong.
Slowly but surely, we managed to build a life for ourselves. My younger self excelled academically, avoiding mistakes that had set us back in the past. We found employment and slowly saved enough money for a fresh start when the time came.
Eventually, after five long years, the opportunity to return home materialized. With excitement and trepidation, I prepared to leave my past self behind, knowing that our lives would soon diverge once again.
As I stood in our old dorm room for the last time, I couldn't help but feel a bittersweet blend of gratitude and melancholy. I owed my younger self everything, for his trust and unwavering support had pulled me through.
With a final farewell, I stepped through time once more, returning to my original present. The memories of those five years spent with my younger self would forever be etched in my heart, a reminder of the resilience and determination that can be found even in the most unlikely of circumstances.
