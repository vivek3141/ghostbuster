Sure! Here's a draft for a 200-word story based on the given prompt:
As I walked into the cozy little café, a feeling of unease washed over me. The waiter who greeted me seemed friendly enough, but there was something about him that made my imagination run wild. I couldn't shake off the nagging thought that he resembled Hitler. Not entirely, just in certain angles and expressions. I tried to dismiss the idea as absurd, reminding myself that Hitler was long gone. Nonetheless, curiosity got the better of me. 
With each passing minute, I discreetly observed him. He moved gracefully, serving other customers with a polite smile. There were no swastika tattoos or hateful ideologies emanating from him. Yet, I couldn't help but wonder if my suspicions were true. 
Summoning my courage, I struck up a conversation with him while he took my order. Gradually, we delved into deeper topics, discussing art, literature, and philosophy. His eloquence and vast knowledge impressed me; Hitler had never been known for such qualities. His gaze was sincere, void of the intense fanaticism I had seen in old footage. 
Minutes turned into hours as the waiter and I continued our dialogue. We shared laughter, drank coffee, and debated theories. Eventually, in this stranger's presence, my nagging doubts dispersed like the morning mist. This man wasn't Hitler; he was just a waiter who happened to bear a faint resemblance. 
In the end, I left the café with a smile, grateful for an enlightening conversation and a lesson in not judging based on appearances. We never truly know someone until we give them a chance to prove themselves, regardless of any reservations we may have had.
