In the year 2021, a peculiar phenomenon dubbed "clone clubs" took the world by storm. These establishments allowed visitors to indulge in an extraordinary experience â€“ spending up to 12 hours with a clone created from their own chosen person's DNA. The clones, however, were unceremoniously disposed of afterward.
In the heart of the bustling city, Clone Haven was one of the most coveted clone clubs. Vibrant neon lights illuminated the establishment's entrance, drawing in eager patrons seeking an escape from reality. Joshua, an adventurous young man, made his way inside, curiosity etched on his face.
Joshua hesitated for a moment, contemplating whose clone he should request. Memories flashed through his mind, and a familiar face emerged. The late Mahatma Gandhi, a beacon of peace and wisdom, captivated Joshua's thoughts. With fervor, he presented the clone club employees with a strand of Gandhi's hair.
As he entered the designated chamber, Joshua was struck by a sight so uncannily similar to the historical figure he admired. The clone, imbued with Gandhi's essence, radiated an aura of serenity and compassion. Over the next few hours, Joshua basked in enlightening conversations, imbibing wisdom, and embracing a profound sense of empathy.
However, as Joshua's time with the clone neared its end, he couldn't shake the melancholy that loomed over their encounter. The clone's existence, merely fleeting, seemed excessively cruel. How could such a valuable creation, a replica embodying the spirit of a remarkable individual, be so easily discarded?
Leaving Clone Haven, Joshua's heart swelled with conflicting emotions. He couldn't extinguish the flame that burned within him; the flame of change. Determined, he pledged to honor the legacy of those he admired, working toward a world where clones were granted their own existence. And in doing so, perhaps, he would make Mahatma Gandhi's spirit live on, not just within clones but within the hearts of humankind.
