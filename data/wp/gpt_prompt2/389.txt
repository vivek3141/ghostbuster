Sure! Here's a 100-word story based on your prompt:
In a world where quantum immortality was an undisputed fact, I was burdened with a unique awareness. With every end, whether from accidents or old age, I was continuously reborn into another iteration of my life. Determined to uncover the truth, I delved into scientific research, seeking answers to my eternal existence. Countless times, I perished violently or peacefully, always returning to the beginning. Over time, I grew weary, the weight of infinite lives weighing heavily on my soul. Immortality had become a lonely curse, for I alone knew the torment of experiencing death repeatedly, unable to escape its grasp.
