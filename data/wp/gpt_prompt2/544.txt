As I walked down the bustling city street, a peculiar sound began to fill the air. Growing louder by the second, the urgent wail of an ambulance siren echoed through the canyon-like buildings. Something felt off. Suddenly, I remembered the new medical technology that could predict accidents before they unfolded. Could this be one of those instances? My heart raced as I sprinted ahead, desperate to avoid becoming entangled in some unforeseen calamity. Just as the siren was about to pass me, screeching tires and a deafening crash erupted behind me. My pulse quickened; fate had intervened, sparing me from an unknown disaster.
