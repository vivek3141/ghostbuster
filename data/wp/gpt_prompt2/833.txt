Title: The Final Appointment
Word count: 500
I am the silent harbinger of death, my existence shrouded in secrecy. My name is spoken only in whispers, if spoken at all. I am a master assassin, diligently working for the government to relieve the strain on the economy caused by medical advancements that have propelled the lifespan of humans to unthinkable lengths. I am tasked with making it look like an accident, for the sake of the nation’s future.
In the heart of the bustling city, where towering skyscrapers scrape the heavens, I find myself perched on the rooftop of a grand hospital—the symbol of medical triumph and longevity. Hidden in the shadows, I observe the countless faces of those blissfully unaware of the mission that lies before me.
Today, my target is a wealthy octogenarian named Henry McAllister. His once vibrant life has been extended beyond the natural cycle, and his never-ending pension now presents a burden upon our economy. Society thrives on the movements of generation after generation, and yet here he remains, stagnant in his old age.
Through the scope of my rifle, I watch Henry as he strolls through the hospital's botanical gardens. His advanced age is evident, manifested in the thinness of his hair and the fragility of his painfully slow steps. With each breath, I remind myself of the greater good, of the necessity for his departure.
I meticulously plan my approach, focusing on every detail. Timing is of the essence. A flock of birds bursts through the sky, their fluttering wings providing the perfect cover for the deafening sound as I pull the trigger. My bullet pierces the air like a phantom, seemingly hidden in the chaos of the natural world.
Moments later, a slow, fatal decline takes hold of Henry, bringing an end to his prolonged existence. The medical staff rushes to his aid, their determined faces filled with concern. The chaos unfolds like a well-choreographed play, unaware that the curtain call has arrived.
As I make my exit, invisible amongst the frantic crowd, I move like a specter, leaving no trace behind. The echo of my actions reverberates in the silence of my mind. The burden on the economy has been lightened, but the weight on my conscience remains heavy.
Days turn into nights, and nights turn into days as my service to the government continues. Each target presents a new challenge, a new life to cut short for the greater good. My emotions are buried deep within me, concealed behind the mask I wear in this world of shadows.
With each assignment, I begin to question the justness of my actions. I strain against the notion that I am but a pawn in a game of circumstance, forced to influence that which should be decided by destiny alone. Yet, I continue down the path I have chosen, sacrificing my own peace for the greater good.
In this era of advanced medical technology, where life expectancy surpasses all limits, I am a harbinger of fate, manipulating existence itself. The never-ending pensions that have once crippled our nation are being eased, one accidental demise at a time.
And so, I persist in the shadows, haunted by the knowledge that in this world of twisted ethics, sometimes the greatest tragedy of all is found in the dance between life and the inevitability of death.
