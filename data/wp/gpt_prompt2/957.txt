Before we allow the human race to join us in the stars, we asked them to acknowledge the faults of their kind. They stood before us, their gaze meeting ours with humility and hope. With earnest sincerity, they recounted the flaws that tainted their history. They spoke of wars fought over greed and power, of inequality that still persisted, and of the destruction they had brought upon their planet. Yet, in their voices, faint whispers of determination and resilience resonated. They acknowledged their mistakes and vowed to rectify the damage, to learn from their past and strive for unity, compassion, and harmony. In that moment, redemption glimmered in their eyes, and a path towards a shared future began to unfold.
