Sure! Here's a draft for your 200-word story:
At the exact moment of birth, a timer materializes on every person's wrist. It ticks away, counting down the seconds until they meet their soulmate. For Cassandra, her timer reminded her constantly of the impending meeting. But as the years went by, her timer seemed to slow down, filling her with doubt.
Days turned into weeks, then months, and eventually years. Cassandra watched as her friends' timers reached zero, one by one, while her own kept ticking. She began to lose hope, wondering if she would ever find her soulmate.
As time passed, Cassandra decided to take a different approach. She embraced her passions and surrounded herself with like-minded individuals. She found solace in beautiful art, live music, and adventurous travels. Her heart began to open, and her timer, though still ticking, no longer consumed her thoughts.
One summer evening, while attending an art gallery opening, Cassandra's eyes locked with a stranger across the room. It was as if time stopped, and every worry she had evaporated. The universe aligning, their timers matched seamlessly, and their souls recognized each other instantly.
In that moment, Cassandra understood that her timer had never been a measure of fate, but a reminder to continuously seek love and connection. It wasn't just about finding the one, but discovering oneself in the process.
Their introduced souls embarked on a lifelong journey, hand in hand. Together, they learned that true love was not dictated by a countdown on their wrists, but by the infinite moments they chose to spend exploring the world with open hearts and open arms.
