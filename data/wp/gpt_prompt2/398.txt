In the desolate wasteland, a lone man stood amidst the ashen remains. Armed with a sturdy broom, he surveyed the devastation that stretched before him. The world had crumbled, consumed by chaos and destruction. Yet, he clung to hope. With each swing of his broom, he swept away the debris, revealing fragments of a forgotten past. He knew he couldn't undo the end, but he refused to let it define his spirit. As he swept, he whispered tales of a better world to the winds, promising that one day, mankind would rise again from the ashes of its own demise.
