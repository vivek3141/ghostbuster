In the Commonwealth, where ruins of once-grand cities stretched as far as the eye could see, the warmth of Christmas found a place in the hearts of survivors. As snow gently fell upon the wasteland, parents gathered their children around flickering fires, weaving tales of old Saint Nick. They spoke of a time before the bombs fell, when happiness and merriment ruled the world. The children listened intently, their imaginations painting vivid pictures of reindeer soaring across the sky and a jolly man bringing gifts. In this shattered land, the tale of Santa Claus offered a glimmer of hope and reminded them that miracles were still possible, even in the face of devastation.
