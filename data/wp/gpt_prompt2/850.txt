Sure! Here's a draft for your 100-word story:
It all happened so suddenly. One moment, I was peacefully reading by the window, and the next, chaos erupted. The ground rumbled beneath me, shaking everything in its wake. Dust filled the air, masks hurriedly worn. Panic became the soundtrack. People ran frantically, searching for safety amidst the turmoil. Buildings crumbled like sandcastles, reducing them to nothing. The sky turned dark, ominous. Amidst the devastation, a glimmer of hope emerged. Strangers held hands, united by collective fear and determination. Slowly, we rebuilt our world, brick by brick, tearing down the barriers that once separated us.
