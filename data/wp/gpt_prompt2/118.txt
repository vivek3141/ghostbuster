In the heart of the vast, untamed sea,
There's a tale of an island where dragons be.
Guarded by three fierce ladies, brave and true,
Their courage shines through, in everything they do.
Upon the shores of emerald green,
An island of legends, like none you've seen.
With scales shining bright, dragons take flight,
Their fiery roar echoing through the night.
Chorus:
Hoist the sails, and let the wind blow,
To that island where dragons freely roam.
With three fierce women, to guard their home,
Through storms and battles, they'll never be alone.
The first woman, Willow, with eyes like the sky,
A warrior's spirit, fierce and high.
With her bow and arrows, she never misses,
Defending the island from dragon foes' hisses.
Second is Sophia, with hair like the sand,
A healer of hearts, with gentle hands.
Whispering to dragons with love and care,
They're tamed by her touch, no danger to bear.
Chorus:
Hoist the sails, and let the wind blow,
To that island where dragons freely roam.
With three fierce women, to guard their home,
Through storms and battles, they'll never be alone.
Last but not least, there's Cassandra the bold,
A fearless captain, with stories untold.
With her sword and shield, she leads the way,
Facing every challenge that comes her way.
Together they stand, a sisterhood of might,
Protecting their island, both day and night.
Dragons take shelter in caves by the shore,
With the fierce women guarding forevermore.
Chorus:
Hoist the sails, and let the wind blow,
To that island where dragons freely roam.
With three fierce women, to guard their home,
Through storms and battles, they'll never be alone.
So, sailors, embark on this quest,
To the island of legends, where dragons rest.
With three fierce women, their bravery untold,
Find the island of dragons, a treasure to behold.
