Sure, here's a draft of a 400-word story based on the given prompt:
In a world where crime had become a rarity, I found myself in the grim solitude of one of the few remaining prisons. The crime rate had been steadily declining for centuries, but I was among the last individuals incarcerated on the whole planet.
As I sat in my isolated cell, the weight of my actions pressed heavily upon me. It wasn't easy being one of the last remnants of an era characterized by lawlessness and chaos. Society had transformed, leaving behind the darkness I continued to carry within me.
Outside the prison walls, the world thrived in an aura of serenity. Peace had become the norm, so much so that law enforcement struggled to find any work. Judges sat idle as their courtrooms gathered dust. Yet here I was, a living testament to humanity's tainted past.
My mind often wandered, trying to fathom how I ended up in this desolate position. It was a combination of bad choices and a stubborn refusal to embrace the evolving world. But I couldn't escape the truth: I was a criminal, condemned to be reminded every day of the irreversible consequences of my actions.
Inside my prison cell, time became a languid dance. Days blurred into weeks, and weeks morphed into months. In the absence of crime, the authorities sought alternative purposes for these obsolete correctional facilities. My jailers had become caretakers, their primary objective to safeguard the fleeting history of crime.
Despite their best efforts, isolation gnawed at my soul. I yearned for redemption, for a second chance to contribute to the peaceful world beyond these walls. Yet, society had moved on, leaving no path for redemption for someone like me.
Occasionally, the prison administration received visitors. Former convicts who had been rehabilitated came to share stories of their rebirth and progression in the modern world. Their tales filled the sterile air with hope, but they also accentuated the harsh reality of my own situation.
As the years trudged on, I watched as more prisons shut down, their walls collapsing like the crumbling remnants of a forgotten past. My sentence, it seemed, had extended far beyond any physical boundaries.
Now truly alone, I had no audience except for my shattered reflection in the cold, stainless-steel mirror. It was here, within the confines of my own conscience, that I made a choice. I would strive to find peace, not just within myself, but also within the world if given the opportunity.
The day finally arrived when the remaining prison doors creaked open, freeing the last few prisoners into a world unfamiliar to us. The authorities bid us farewell, their faces etched with a mixture of relief and regret. We stepped outside, blinking into the dazzling sunlight, determined to prove ourselves worthy of society's trust once more.
As I took my first steps towards freedom, I knew that although I had been among the last incarcerated individuals, I would strive to be one of the first rehabilitated souls, contributing to a hopeful, peaceful future.
