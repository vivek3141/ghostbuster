In shadows deep, my spirit lingers lost,
A haunting whisper, recounting the cost.
Through veils of darkness, a breathless plea,
Betrayed by hands, relentless, free.
A life once cherished, now shrouded in pain,
In jagged echoes, my memories wane.
The silence broken, an anguish untold,
By cruel hands, my tale was foretold.
Each crimson stain, a mark of deceit,
A twisted dance where sin and secrets meet.
In cold embrace, my life was severed,
With every blow, my will was hithered.
Alas, the truth, concealed within lies,
As darkness shatters, agony cries.
For in this tale, a mirror to see,
The depths of human frailty.
