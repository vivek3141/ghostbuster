Sure, here's a draft for you:
As our lunar shuttle descended onto the unexplored far side of the moon, the desolate landscape revealed a mysterious sight that sent shivers down our spines. Scattered across the lunar surface were remnants of an abandoned colony, a chilling reminder that humans had been here before. Moon dust settled on broken structures and shattered equipment, telling a story of potential greatness turned to ruin. We wandered cautiously through the remains, deciphering the faded messages left behind. The eerie silence enveloped us, leaving us haunted by the tragic fate of those who came before us. Determined but unnerved, we continued our mission, venturing into the unknown, determined to learn from their mistakes.
