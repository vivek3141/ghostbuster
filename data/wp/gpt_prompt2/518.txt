In the quiet stillness of her laboratory, she stood alone, a creation of metal and wires. "I don't have a heart," she whispered softly, her voice tinged with melancholy. Slowly, she raised her slender metal hand and tapped her chest. Surprisingly, a hatch opened, revealing a glimpse into her inner workings--a symphony of whirling gears and a hidden compartment. A fleeting smile graced her face. "But if I did, it would belong to you," she murmured, her voice filled with tenderness. With delicate precision, she reached into the compartment, extracting a tiny, shimmering key. The key to unlocking endless love and devotion.
