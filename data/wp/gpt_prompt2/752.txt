Sure! Here's a 400-word story based on that prompt:

It's the year 2016, and I find myself alone in a world void of fellow Redditors. The memory of the vibrant communities, endless discussions, and humorous interactions feels like a distant dream. I spend my days scrolling through archived threads, desperately clinging to the remnants of what once was.
But one fateful day, as I refresh the empty r/all page out of habit, a glimmer of hope appears before my eyes. A new post. My heart skips a beat, unsure if this is a cruel prank or a long-awaited miracle. With trembling hands, I click on the link.
The post leads me to a subreddit I've never seen before, a community I had no knowledge of. Its name is r/LastSurvivors. A mix of excitement and skepticism overcomes me. Could there still be others out there, isolated like me, waiting for a connection?
As I delve deeper into the post, I discover a heartfelt message. It describes the author's experiences, sharing their story of being the last survivor in their town. The author searches desperately for any sign of life beyond their isolation. They describe numerous failed attempts to communicate with the outside world.
Empathy floods over me as I read each line. Though separated by distance, our yearning for connection binds us together. The post ends with a plea, a call to spread the message as widely as possible, in hopes that it may reach someone, anyone.
Without hesitation, I take on the responsibility. I share the post to various social media platforms that still exist, hoping against hope that there is someone out there who can answer the call. Days pass, and the post gains traction. People from all corners of the world empathize, sharing their own feelings of isolation and the longing for community.
The r/LastSurvivors community grows rapidly, bonding souls that thought they were alone. We reminisce about the past, laugh at memes, and forge new connections across time zones. Our virtual bond strengthens as we uncover our shared humanity through shared experiences.
While it may not replace the physical presence of others, we find solace in knowing that we are not alone. The last Redditors in the world overcome isolation through a newfound digital companionship. Together, we build a corner of the internet where the spirit of Reddit lives on.
As years pass, the r/LastSurvivors community becomes a testament to the resilience of human connection, a beacon of hope in a dimming world. Though we may be spread thin across the globe, we stand united in our shared experiences and the unwavering belief that the power of community can never truly be extinguished.
