In the desolate wastelands of post-invasion Earth, where hope was as rare as a drop of water in a scorching desert, I found myself standing among the chosen. We were the remnants of humanity, survivors of the harrowing alien onslaught that had nearly wiped us out in 2020. However, our survival came with a heavy price - a tithe, demanded once every decade, to prevent our complete enslavement.
The year was now 2060, and I refused to go quietly, to accept this fate of servitude. As the skies darkened and the alien transport ships descended upon our shanty town, panic engulfed the air. People whispered fears of separation, slavery, and a life stripped of all we held dear. But amidst the cacophony of despair, a fire burned within my soul, driving my determination to challenge our oppressors.
As I stood before the towering alien leader, their cold eyes studying the trembling humans, their misshapen features exuding dominance, I found my voice. "We will not be your servants," I declared, my words echoing through the tense silence. "We are the ones who survived against all odds, who endured the agony and the loss. We will not be broken."
The alien leader regarded me with an air of superiority, bemusement flickering across their face. "You are but a single ant, defying the might of our empire. Do you truly believe your defiance matters?"
With unwavering resolve, I met their gaze. "It matters because we choose to fight, to stand up against oppression, even against insurmountable odds. We may be outnumbered, but we carry the strength of human spirit, which can never be crushed."
A spark of curiosity glimmered in the alien's eyes, but they could not comprehend the depths of our resilience. They ordered their minions to apprehend us, to drag us into the dark abyss of servitude. But we resisted, refusing to surrender our freedom. We fought with everything we had, channeling our pain and anger into a unified force.
As the smoky haze cleared, a glimmer of hope pierced the air. We had triumphed, even against the alien's advanced technology, branding our tenacity into the pages of history. They retreated, leaving behind a trail of destruction and shattered bodies.
And thus, our rebellion began. We became a beacon of defiance for others who refused to remain docile. City after city, we rallied, inspiring resistance among the oppressed. The tithe, once a symbol of our submission, became a rallying cry for liberation.
In the year 2060, amidst the remnants of alien destruction, our determination had revitalized the human spirit. We would not submit or tolerate oppression any longer. Together, we vowed to reclaim our planet and forge a future where humanity dictated its fate. We were the chosen, but now, we chose to fight.
