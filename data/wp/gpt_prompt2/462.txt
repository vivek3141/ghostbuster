Sure, here's a 100-word story based on your prompt:
Meet Sam, the unluckiest person you'll ever encounter. One day, after stubbing his toe on a rusty lamp, a genie appeared. "I am the most sarcastic genie ever," it smirked. Excited but cautious, Sam made his first wish. "I wish I had a mountain of cash!" Suddenly, Sam found himself buried under a mountain. "Figuratively speaking," the genie snickered. Sam sighed. For his second wish, he requested happiness. Soon after, he received endless laughter, but hidden behind tears. Finally, Sam said, "I wish for everlasting love." Suddenly, he saw love and compassion in every person he encountered. The genie granted his wishes figuratively, bringing Sam deeper understanding of life's true treasures.
