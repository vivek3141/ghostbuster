In the grim confines of a digital future, where the allure of knowledge lay hidden beneath layers of prohibition, a small-time, illegal bibliodealer named Tobias stumbled upon a hidden treasure. As the rustling pages whispered secrets, he discovered a book that promised to reshape his life. Its forbidden contents, capable of captivating even the broken spirits, could fetch a fortune. Yet, fate twisted its cruel tongue, for Tobias had succumbed to the spell of the written word. With every page he turned, his addiction deepened, his ambition fading. The book, once his salvation, became the chains that bound him, leaving him forever lost in the intoxicating haze of his own creation.
