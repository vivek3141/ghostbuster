Sure! Here's a draft for your 100-word story:
22:58. Amy sat at her desk, staring at the clock ticking down. Her heart raced, anticipation growing. Moments ago, a mysterious note had arrived on her doorstep. The contents had sent shivers down her spine: "23:00 - you know where." Thoughts raced through her mind. Who could have sent it? She glanced at her watch again, two minutes left. In a split-second decision, she grabbed her coat and hurriedly left the house. Arriving at her favorite park, she spotted a familiar silhouette waiting beneath a flickering lamppost. The stranger turned. It was her sister, Emily, a devious smile on her face.
