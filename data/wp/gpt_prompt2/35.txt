As the bus rumbled down the street, I leaned my head against the cool glass, my mind lost in a sea of mundane thoughts. It was just another ordinary day, or so I thought. Little did I know, something extraordinary was about to unfold before my eyes.
Suddenly, the bus lurched to a stop, jolting me out of my reverie. Confused, I blinked rapidly and glanced around, curious as to what had caused the abrupt interruption. And that's when I saw them.
They materialized like ghostly apparitions, their figures shimmering in the dimly lit bus. Soul escorts. I had always possessed the unique ability to see these ethereal beings, who appeared to guide the souls of those approaching death to the other side. But never before had I witnessed so many at once, crowding the bus as if it were their final stop.
The atmosphere grew heavy with an eerie silence as the escorts, dressed in flowing white robes, moved gracefully between the bus seats. A mix of fear and curiosity swelled within me as I observed their solemn expressions, their ethereal presence sending shivers down my spine.
I stole a glance at my fellow passengers, wondering if any of them were aware of the escorts' presence. To my surprise, they seemed entirely oblivious, engrossed in their own little worlds of conversations and cell phone screens. How could they be so unaware of this extraordinary phenomenon?
As the bus pulled away from the curb, the escorts glided effortlessly through the crowded aisles, their eyes fixed on certain individuals. I found it nearly impossible to tear my gaze away from the scene unfolding before me. It was as if the entire bus was enshrouded in an otherworldly tranquility, as if time itself had frozen, allowing only the escorts and me to exist in this surreal moment.
My heart raced as one of the escorts approached an elderly woman sitting in the front row. Her face was etched with wisdom and the weight of years lived, yet she seemed oblivious to the presence drawing nearer to her. The escort gently placed a hand on her shoulder, and I watched as her eyes widened in recognition.
With a soft smile, the elderly woman stood up, her movements slow and deliberate. She glanced around the bus, acknowledging the escorts standing beside other passengers. It was then that I understood; their presence was a sign, a gentle reassurance that death was imminent, yet not to be feared.
The bus came to another abrupt halt, and the doors swung open with a hiss. The escorts ushered the departing souls gently towards the exit, guiding them towards their final destination. I watched, awestruck, as the elderly woman and others departed the bus, disappearing into the ethereal glow surrounding the escorts.
As the final soul exited the bus, the escorts turned their attention towards me. Their eyes, shimmering with a mixture of understanding and solace, seemed to communicate an unspoken messageâ€”the time will come when we'll meet again. And with that, they vanished, leaving the bus empty and void of their divine presence.
As the bus resumed its journey, I contemplated the profound experience I had just witnessed. From that day forward, I understood that life is a fragile and transient gift, and that the escorts served as a reminder to cherish every moment, for we never know when it may be our last.
