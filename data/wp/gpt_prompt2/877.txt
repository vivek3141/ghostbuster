In the fleeting seconds before impact, Sarah's heart felt as though it would burst through her chest. The screeching tires, the blaring horns, and the horrifying realization that she was moments away from a devastating collision shook her to her core. With a last-ditch plea for salvation, she raised her trembling hands in the air and cried out, "Jesus take the wheel!"
The cacophony of chaos abruptly ceased, leaving behind an eerie silence. Slowly, Sarah mustered the courage to open her eyes, bracing herself for the worst. Her body remained intact, untouched by the wreckage she had anticipated. Relief washed over her, only to be replaced by confusion when she comprehended the unfamiliar surroundings.
Blinking away disbelief, Sarah gazed upon the unfamiliar face behind the steering wheel. It was not Jesus who had saved her from the jaws of catastrophe. Instead, a kind-eyed stranger peered at her intently, a serene smile playing at the corners of his lips.
"Are you alright?" he asked, his voice soothing like a gentle breeze.
Sarah nodded dumbly, battling to find her voice. "Wh-who are you?"
"I'm Michael," he replied, his voice carrying a warmth that belied his words. "I couldn't stand by and watch that accident happen. I had to step in."
As her racing heartbeat gradually steadied, Sarah took in her surreal surroundings. The once busy intersection was now desertedâ€”no signs of wreckage, shattered glass, or even the faintest hint of a collision.
"But... how?" Sarah stammered, her mind grappling with the impossible. "What happened?"
Michael's eyes twinkled with an otherworldly wisdom. "Sometimes, miracles happen in unexpected ways. I was sent to keep you safe, by any means necessary."
As the realization dawned upon her, a shiver of awe coursed through Sarah's veins. In that extraordinary moment, she realized that sometimes, salvation came not from the divine, but from extraordinary people, sent to protect us when we need it the most.
