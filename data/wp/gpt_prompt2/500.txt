As a writer, selecting prompts to dive into required more than personal preference. It became an intuitive dance between challenge and inspiration. The first filter was feasibility - could I work with the idea given the word limit? Next, intrigue played a role. Did the prompt spark curiosity, urging me to explore new territories? Additionally, relatability mattered. A prompt that stirred emotions and memories within me tended to yield the most genuine and captivating stories. Lastly, impact became important. If a prompt had the potential to evoke emotions or make a statement that resonated with readers, it was chosen. Ultimately, the prompts that made me think, feel, and make a lasting impression were my chosen ones.
