In the depths of the Third Reich, where darkness intertwined with power, there lurked a top-secret division of the SS. Tasked with the unimaginable duty of protecting Adolf Hitler from the countless time travelers seeking to alter history, this secretive faction wielded swift justice against those who dared trespass upon their carefully guarded realm.
March 23, 1943, marked a pivotal moment for The Division. As midnight approached, the evening silence was torn apart by a sharp crack, a subtle indication that a time portal had opened. Deep underground, at the heart of this clandestine organization, the division's commander, Colonel Friedrich von Herrmann, issued immediate orders for his elite agents to stand ready.
Silently, the first trespasser emerged from the portal, disoriented by the abrupt shift in time. Streaks of darkness crawled up the figure's uniform, a somber indication of a lethal objective. Detecting the presence with unparalleled precision, The Division sprang into action, unleashing their agents against the interloper. Utilizing their honed combat skills, the time traveler's assassination attempt was swiftly thwarted, and the intruder vanished back through the portal.
Days dissolved into weeks, and weeks bled into years as The Division endured tireless vigilance. Countless battles waged within the walls of this hidden sanctuary, as desperate time travelers hatched ever more creative attempts on Hitler's life. One particular assailant arrived posing as a servant, cleverly disguising a homemade explosive within an innocent-looking tray of food.
Through sheer intuition, The Division's agents recognized the threat before it came to fruition. They swiftly disarmed the servant, dispatching him back to his own time, where history unfolded as originally intended.
Yet amidst the chaos, a renowned physicist discovered a tear in the fabric of time itself, silently altering historical events to protect one of humanity's most hated figures. Harnessing newfound knowledge, The Division's scientists constructed a vast network of temporal sensors, bolstering their efforts to secure the Führer's existence.
Overwhelmed by a sense of perseverance and determination, The Division continued their tiresome fight against time-traveling assassins, fervently protecting Adolf Hitler. Their work went unnoticed by the masses, and the true extent of their sacrifices remained forever sealed within the shadows of secrecy.
As the war approached its climactic conclusion, The Division stood strong, woven among the many tales and mysteries that history would never divulge. Notwithstanding the misdeeds of the regime they served, they fought proudly, sacrificing themselves to ensure the course of history remained unchanged.
And so, in this secret, inky void—this timeless between—The Division persisted, eternally vigilant, their mission to guard the most reviled figure of an era rapidly ticking away in the realm of what might have been.
