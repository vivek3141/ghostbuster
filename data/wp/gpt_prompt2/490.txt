In a desolate world ravaged by time, I stood alone, bearing the weight of solitude like a burden. We were two, once. My companion and I fought against the odds, clinging to hope amidst an abyss of desolation. Yet fate played its wicked hand, snatching my last semblance of companionship. She was gone, leaving behind silence that echoed like a haunting requiem. Memories of laughter and tender warmth painfully etched upon my withered heart. Sorrow hung heavy in the air, entangled with pangs of regret. Amidst the ruins, I remained, a solitary figure witnessing the extinction of humanity in desolate silence.
