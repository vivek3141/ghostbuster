Sure! Here's a 1000-word story based on the prompt:
It had been thousands of years since Earth had been destroyed, and the surviving remnants of humanity had fled to two different planets in search of a new home. On one side of the galaxy, there was Nova Terra, a lush planet filled with dense forests and vast oceans. On the other side, there was Aurora Prime, a desert planet with scorching temperatures and scarce resources. 
Over the centuries, all contact between these two groups had been lost. Their separate colonies thrived and developed their own unique cultures and ways of life. The stories of their home planet, Earth, became myths and legends, passed down through generations.
On Nova Terra, a young woman named Elara had always been curious about her ancestors and the lost history of Earth. She spent countless hours in the archives, extracting fragments of information about her forgotten past. One day, while sifting through ancient texts, Elara stumbled upon a document that caught her attention. It spoke of long-lost explorers and settlers who had ventured far into the galaxy. The document recounted tales of a lost colony on a distant planet called Aurora Prime.
Elara's heart raced with excitement as she delved deeper into her research. The more she discovered, the more determined she became to find her people's lost brethren on Aurora Prime. She shared her findings with the council of Nova Terra, who initially dismissed her claims as mere folklore. But Elara was unyielding. She convinced them of the possibilities that lay beyond their known universe.
A group of explorers was assembled, and with Elara as their guide, they embarked on a perilous journey to find Aurora Prime. For years, they sailed through the vastness of space, overcoming countless obstacles and dangers, with hope as their beacon. Until finally, they arrived.
As the spaceships hovered above Aurora Prime, the explorers marveled at the sight before them. The once barren planet had transformed into a breathtaking metropolis. Gleaming towers and advanced technologies stood as testament to the progress this lost colony had made during their separation from Nova Terra.
The people of Aurora Prime, known as the Aurorans, greeted the Nova Terrans with skepticism and awe. They had long believed themselves to be the only survivors of Earth's destruction. Many believed the ancient stories of Nova Terra to be mere fantasy.
But as the two groups slowly began to reconnect and share their respective histories, they realized the truth that lay beneath the surface. United by their shared ancestry, the Nova Terrans and the Aurorans set forth on a new journey together.
Over time, the colonies started to thrive once more, each bringing their unique strengths to the table. The lush landscapes of Nova Terra provided an abundance of natural resources, while the advanced technology of Aurora Prime propelled them into a new age of discovery.
New generations were born, and the stories of Earth were no longer myths and legends but realities that shaped their identities. The once divided colonies grew into a united civilization that stretched across two planets.
As the stars twinkled overhead, the people of Nova Terra and Aurora Prime gazed up, pondering the infinite possibilities of the universe they now shared. The rediscovery of one another had not only reconnected distant relatives but had also sparked a renaissance of knowledge, culture, and friendship.
And so, the remnants of humanity, once scattered across the cosmos, had found their way back home, not to the original Earth they had lost, but to a new Earth they had built together.
