Sure! Here's a draft for your 600-word story:
---
I sit alone, the last remaining soul in a desolate world. The once vibrant cities now lay in ruins, an eerie silence filling the air. The apocalypse scenario of my worst nightmares has become a haunting reality. And yet, amidst the destruction, electricity and the internet still somehow persist.
With a glimmer of hope left inside me, I take to the familiar platform of Reddit and post a desperate plea on /r/askreddit: "Is there anybody else out there?" The words barely escape my trembling fingers as I hit the 'submit' button. I wait, my heart pounding, for a reply that may never come.
Weeks pass, and each passing day brings me closer to accepting my solitary fate. The world outside my window is one of desolation and despair. But in the confines of my lonely room, the hum of electricity and the flickering computer screen offer a sense of connection, a thin thread tying me to humanity's past.
And then, unexpectedly, a single upvote appears. My heart skips a beat. Someone has seen my cry for help, acknowledging my existence, even if only fleetingly. But there is no accompanying reply, no words of solace or companionship. Just an upvote, a silent nod from an unknown observer.
Days turn into months as I cling onto the hope that this lone upvote signifies. It becomes my lifeline, my fragile connection with a world that may no longer exist. Every night, before I drift into uneasy sleep, I gaze at the pale glow of the computer screen, seeking solace and a sign of life from the upvote.
But as the days go by, the upvote remains solitary, no other interaction emerging from the depths of the internet. I am haunted by the possibility that the person behind that upvote may have perished just like everyone else. The despair I had momentarily pushed aside begins to resurface, threatening to consume me entirely.
In my darkest moments, I shift my focus from the unanswered plea on Reddit to the task at hand. With the internet and electricity still at my disposal, I become a chronicler of the apocalypse. I document the events leading to this catastrophic end, hoping that one day, somehow, someone might stumble upon my perspective and understand the depths of humanity's demise.
As the years roll on, the world outside my window continues its descent into ruin. Nature slowly reclaims what was once inhabited by millions. My existence feels increasingly insignificant, like a whisper in the void. But I persist, driven by the memory of that one upvote—the sliver of hope that kept me going when all else seemed lost.
And then, as if in a dream, a notification pops up on my screen. It's a reply—a response to my desperate plea from years before. A tinge of excitement builds within me as I hastily click on the message. The words on the screen come into focus, and tears blur my vision as I read:
"I'm here. I've survived."
With trembling hands, I type out my response, tears of relief streaming down my face. A flicker of hope reignites within me as I realize I am not alone. Together, we will navigate this broken world, piece by broken piece, finding solace and purpose in our shared survival.
