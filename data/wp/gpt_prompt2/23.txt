Sure! Here's a draft for your 100-word story:
As I faced the dreaded task of cleaning out the refrigerator, I reached for the container that had been lurking at the back for far too long. The moment the lid cracked open, an unimaginable stench escaped, assaulting my senses. A putrid, yellow-green slime clung to the walls of the container, reminiscent of a science experiment gone wrong. The decaying remnants of leftovers were transformed into a grotesque mess where mold colonies thrived, their fuzzy tendrils intertwining like a sickening cobweb. The sight alone made me gag, as the nauseating odor permeated the room, lingering in the air like a turpentine-infested fog.
