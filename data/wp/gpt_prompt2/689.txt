Once upon a morning, a curious fate,
Befell a person, in a peculiar state.
A curse had arrived, unbidden, unsought,
Forcing all their words to rhyme, as they ought.
Their boss approached with a serious tone,
An important meeting, but the curse had shown.
"I have something to share," our cursed friend said,
"A strange power now resides in my head.
In rhyming verse, I must express,
Each thought and feeling, no more, no less."
The boss perplexed, wore a puzzled smile,
Though confused, listened for a little while.
With patience, our cursed friend did explain,
The curse's weight and their linguistic chain.
The spouse then was told, with love in their eyes,
Of the rhyming spell that led to surprised sighs.
Together they chuckled, finding joy in plight,
Supporting each other, through day and through night.
Finally, classmates were brought to the know,
That rhymed conversations were now to flow.
Amusement spread, as they laughed and played,
A lesson in creativity, to never fade.
So, our story ends, with lessons to share,
To embrace the quirks that life may bear.
For though cursed, this soul found a way,
To connect through rhymes, every single day.
