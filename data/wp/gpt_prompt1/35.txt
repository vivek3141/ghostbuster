As I sat on the bus, my eyes idly scanned the rows of weary commuters. It was a familiar sight, faces lost in the monotony of their daily lives. But something caught my attention, a flicker of movement in the corner of my vision. Curiosity gnawed at me as I turned to look, and what I saw nearly stole my breath away.
There, lining the aisles of the bus, were soul escorts. These ethereal beings dwelled in the realm between life and death, only visible to those with the peculiar gift of second sight. I had always considered myself an observer of this mysterious world, but never before had I witnessed such a captivating sight.
Each escort bore a unique aura, some glowing with warmth and compassion, while others exuded an eerie, unsettling energy. They floated silently, their ethereal forms barely brushing against the seats of the bus. Some hovered protectively around individuals, their translucent fingers reaching out as if to offer solace. Others stood solemnly, their eyes fixed on certain souls, marked for an imminent departure from the world of the living.
The unease in the air was palpable. A shiver ran down my spine as I realized the gravity of the situation. Death, in all its chilling certainty, was about to claim the lives of those on this very bus. I leaned forward, yearning to understand the scene unfolding before me with a mixture of dread and fascination.
Among those escorted souls, I felt a pang of familiarity. The woman sitting across from me, a middle-aged woman with lines etched deeply into her face, had an escort cloaked in gentle light, a sign that her journey would be peaceful. A young man, barely out of his teens, had an escort that flickered with an intensity that sent chills down my spine.
Questions swirled in my mind. What brought these souls to such an unfortunate fate? And why was I chosen to be the silent witness to this scene? Could there be something I could do to intervene?
But a deep understanding washed over me. My gift was that of a seer, not a savior. The escorts allowed me a glimpse into their world, an invitation to bear witness to the final moments of life. It was not for me to tamper with the natural order, no matter how much empathy swelled within my heart.
As the bus halted, a collective sigh seemed to rise from the escorts. They gradually faded, their ethereal forms melting away as their purpose was fulfilled. The world shifted back into focus, and the bus resumed its journey, oblivious to the weight that now burdened my soul.
From that day forward, I carried the memory of the bus filled with escorts as a reminder of the fleeting nature of existence. Life would forever hold a certain fragility, a bittersweet beauty that I alone had the privilege of witnessing. And with this burden of knowledge, I resolved to savor every precious moment, knowing that someday, the escorts would come for me too.
