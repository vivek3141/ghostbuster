He spoke of an eccentric experiment, one that would replace my mangled limbs with arms from a deceased donor. My mind swirled with uncertainty, oscillating between fear and fascination.

With trepidation, I agreed to become the world's first four-armed person, ready to embrace the uncharted path that lay ahead.
