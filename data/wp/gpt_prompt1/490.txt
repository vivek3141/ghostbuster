I am the last. Once, there were two of us, clinging to hope amidst the ruins of humanity. We fought the desolation together, sought solace in each other's presence. But now, silence reigns. The echoes of our laughter have faded, replaced by the mournful whisper of wind through empty streets. I am left, burdened with the weight of a world lost. The memories of another's existence consume me, reminding me of the bitter reality. Yet, amid the desolation, a flicker of strength emerges. I am the last, but I will endure, for their memory, for the chance of a tomorrow.
