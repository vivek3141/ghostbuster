In the dim light of the forest, I, a lowly goblin, stood over the fallen hero. Against all odds, I had vanquished the legend who once held us in fear. As his life seeped away, our roles reversed. No longer the feeble creature lurking in shadows, I became the unlikely victor. But as I stared into his lifeless eyes, an unexpected feeling tugged at my heartâ€”regret. For in this land of heroes and monsters, I realized that sometimes even those clad in darkness long for a glimmer of light. The tale of a common goblin, forever changed by a fateful encounter.
