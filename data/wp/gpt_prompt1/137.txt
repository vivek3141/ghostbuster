In a world consumed by material worth, I concealed my extraordinary camera's power. Its lens unveiled the true value of objects, rendering my possessions lackluster. However, an ominous curiosity flickered within me, yet I resisted the urge to look upon another person. Until one fateful day, my camera slipped from my grasp, and its gaze met the eyes of a stranger. To my astonishment, their whole being radiated an ethereal glow, their worth immeasurable. As I met their gaze, the world shifted. No longer blinded by appearances, I discovered the immense value in every human being, forever changing the course of my life.
