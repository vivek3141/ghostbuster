On the triumphant last day of Obama's presidency, a vehicle flew in a streak of fire onto the White House lawn. As the smoke cleared, a disheveled and panicked figure emerged, stumbling out of the DeLorean. It was Bernie Sanders, his eyes wide with urgency, shouting dire warnings about the future.
Gasps filled the air as the crowd gathered, their cheers of celebration now drowned by confusion. President Obama, calm amidst the chaos, rushed forward to greet his fellow statesman. "Bernie, what's going on?" he asked, concern furrowing his brow.
"Barack, listen!" Bernie gasped, briefly glancing over his shoulder. "It's all happening again. The corruption, the inequality, the greed. We thought we had won, but the future is slipping away from us!"
Obama stepped back, his mind racing to make sense of Bernie's words. The realization struck him like a thunderbolt. "Time travel? How is this even possible?"
Bernie's face contorted with frustration. "I've seen it, Barack! I traveled to the future—a future where we failed to make the changes we fought for. A future where hope is eclipsed by despair."
As the crowd watched in awe, Obama realized the immense responsibility that had been thrust upon him. The weight of the nation's fate bore down on his shoulders, but hope burned fiercely within him. With determination in his eyes, he whispered solemnly, "We cannot let that future come to pass. Together, we will fight for a better tomorrow."
And so, on the triumphant last day of Obama's presidency, a new chapter began—a chapter where Bernie Sanders' warning became a rallying cry, inspiring a nation to push for change and rewrite the course of history.
