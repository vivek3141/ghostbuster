For centuries, I have roamed this earth, my twisted existence driven by a hunger that defies mortality. Names whispered in fear, legends spoken in hushed tones—my reign as an immortal serial killer seemed eternal. But hubris had been my undoing. Capture was inevitable, the past catching up with me like a predator closing its trap.
Now, confined within these walls, my time is a mere abstraction. My immortal nature, an affliction bestowed upon me by forces beyond comprehension, haunts me relentlessly. Sentenced to life in this wretched prison, I am confined within a steel and stone tomb.
In the beginning, the wardens and guards paid no heed to the passage of time. Why would they? After all, time weakens the mortal flesh. But as they aged and wilted beneath the relentless march of years, their suspicions were aroused. Questions whispered among themselves, glances laden with confusion cast in my direction. 
Desperate to maintain my calculated guise as a mere mortal, I have contrived numerous diversions—a master of deceit. Yet, the astute minds surrounding me are not easily fooled. They notice the incongruities, the subtle discrepancies in my appearance that betray an existence severed from the clutches of time.
Their inquiries have shifted from casual curiosity to a heightened urgency. The prison walls gradually close in around me, their suspicion rendering the air heavy with an unspoken accusation. Whispers of curses linger in the air—warnings of the unspeakable fate that awaits those who dare to delve deeper.
Within my cell, I am a paradox. An unending existence trapped within finite walls. My victims lie buried beneath unseen soil, and the echoing cries of their anguish reverberate through my thoughts day and night.
I am a prisoner of my own immortality—a perpetual torment to the mortals who seek answers. They will never know the true depths of my monstrous nature, nor the insatiable hunger that has propelled me through the ages. And as they inch closer to the truth, I face an unbearable decision—to revel in the truth of my nature and willingly accept the consequences, or to perpetuate the deception that has kept me hidden for so long.
In this prison, time itself becomes my warden—an immovable force beyond my power to defy. The path ahead is treacherous, but I, the immortal serial killer, shall navigate it with chilling resolve, knowing that even within these walls, my dark legacy will shadow me eternally.
