The first time she called you "mama," tears of joy welled in your eyes. You embraced her, holding onto that precious bond. Time passed, and innocence faded away. Society deemed her a violent monster, but you knew the truth. She was your daughter, troubled and scarred. Yet, you loved her fiercely. As the order was given, she looked into your eyes, the word "mama" escaping her lips one last time. Your heart shattered, forever haunted by the memory. In a world blinded by judgment, you mourned not only her loss, but the loss of humanity's compassion.
