As I boarded the plane, my heart raced, my palms grew clammy. The achievement I had earned moments ago in life now haunted my every thought. "Lucky Survivor: +50% chance of survival in life-threatening situations." It seemed surreal until turbulence struck, shaking the plane violently. Passengers gripped their armrests, but my fear escalated. What if this bonus was a cruel magnet for disaster? As the captain's voice crackled over the intercom, I closed my eyes, praying the achievement's influence would prevail. Survival was an accomplishment worth cherishing, but its weight now burdened my every flight, reminding me of life's delicate threads.
