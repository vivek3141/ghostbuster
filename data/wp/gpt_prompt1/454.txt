In the realms unseen, where ethereal beings roamed freely, there stood a being feared by all: the angel of death. With gossamer wings spanning immeasurable distances and eyes that held the weight of eternal doom, he was tasked with collecting the souls of mortals as they reached the end of their journeys. Yet, hidden within the shadows of his heart, there resided a secret he dared not share.
For years, the angel of death had watched over his mortal son, a boy named Ethan, with bittersweet tenderness. Ethan possessed a touch of ethereal beauty akin to the celestial realm from which his father hailed, his eyes reflecting the same eternal wisdom. Although father and son were forbidden from knowing one another, the angel of death had found solace in observing Ethan's life from a distance.
Today was a day like any other, yet burdened with the foreknowledge that fate's hand would soon fall upon his beloved son's shoulders. The angel of death watched from afar as Ethan's laughter danced amidst a sunlit meadow, his carefree spirit unaware of the orchestration of divine intervention destined to occur.
As dusk settled upon the world, the angel of death hesitated in his eternal duty. The weight of his responsibilities clashed bitterly against his paternal instincts, igniting a tempest of doubt within his soul. He yearned to protect his son from the grip of mortality, but he knew that all things must meet their end.
Descending from the heavens, the angel of death stood silently beside the slumbering form of his son, his heart heavy with the inevitable. Gently, he brushed a strand of silver hair from Ethan's forehead, an act of tenderness that betrayed his divine identity. Tears welled in his radiant eyes, shimmering like diamonds beneath the moon's soft glow.
"Wake, my child," the angel whispered, his voice a whisper carried on a breeze.
Ethan stirred, rousing from the depths of his dreams, his gaze meeting the sorrowful eyes of his father. Confusion flickered in his cerulean eyes, yet he sensed an otherworldly familiarity.
"Who are you?" he asked, his voice trembling with a mix of fear and unknowing.
"I am the guardian of the paths leading beyond this mortal realm," the angel began, his tone laced with emotional resonance. "Today is the day you must pass into eternity."
Ethan's eyes widened in both understanding and acceptance. Instinctively, he reached out, taking his father's hand into his own. Their connection transcended the boundaries of time and space, bridging the gap between angel and mortal.
As the angel of death guided his son towards the gates of infinity, their bond remained unbroken, traversing realms unseen. In that fleeting moment, the angel of death understood that the timeless love between a father and son could transcend even the shadow of death itself.
