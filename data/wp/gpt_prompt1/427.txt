Eighteen centuries in purgatory had taught Satan the folly of his rebellion. He yearned to return to the Celestial Kingdom as Lucifer, the repentant one. Seeking redemption, he approached God. "Prove your reform," said the Almighty. A golden key, imbued with irresistible allure, appeared before him. The key unlocked the power to bend the mortal realm to his whims. Satan hesitated. The challenge was set: resist the opportunity to sin. With trembling resolve, he closed his eyes and returned the key. His yearning for forgiveness outweighed the temptation, as he took one step closer to the gates of Heaven.
