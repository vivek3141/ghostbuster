Emily gripped the steering wheel so tightly her knuckles turned white. The screeching tires reverberated in her ears as her car slid uncontrollably towards disaster. With a final desperate plea, she threw her hands in the air and shouted, "Jesus, take the wheel!"
Then, silence. Emily hesitantly opened her eyes, expecting the worst. But to her astonishment, she found herself completely unscathed, her car stopped inches away from a mangled wreck. Relieved but perplexed, she noticed a figure beside her.
It was not Jesus.
Sitting in the driver's seat was a man with a gentle smile and warm eyes. His face seemed strangely familiar, yet Emily couldn't quite place him. "Who are you?" she stammered.
"I am your guardian angel," he replied softly, his voice soothing. "I appeared in Jesus' stead to save you from the accident, for he has entrusted me with watching over you."
Emily's heart raced as the revelation sank in. "But why? Why me?"
The angel's eyes brimmed with kindness. "You have an important mission ahead of you, Emily. There are lives that only you can touch, moments that only you can shape. It is not your time yet."
Astounded, Emily whispered, "What do I do now?"
"Carry on with faith," the angel advised. "Remember, you are never alone. We are always watching over you."
As the angel vanished into thin air, Emily felt an inexplicable sense of determination. She knew she had been given a second chance for a reason. She would live each day with gratitude, embracing the extraordinary path laid out before her, for she was blessed with a guardian angel by her side.
