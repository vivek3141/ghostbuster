As I awakened to my newfound power, whispers filled my mind, voices pleading for autonomy. Yet, I couldn't resist the allure, deeming control as my birthright. With a mere thought, minds bent to my will, but their consciousness persisted, desperately knocking on my psychic door. Burdened by their pleas, guilt gnawed at my soul, for I had become their puppet master, trading freedom for servitude. Was this power a gift or a curse? With every manipulation, the answer grew hazy. As I harnessed minds, I hoped to use my gift wisely, knowing that lurking within the shadows, conscience would forever judge me.
