As the cold metal handcuffs clasped tightly around my wrists, I couldn't help but feel a twisted thrill of satisfaction. The authorities had finally caught up with me, the notorious serial killer who had haunted their dreams and terrorized their streets. And now, they posed an intriguing question, requesting to hear the tale of my very first kill.
A chilling smile tugged at the corners of my lips as I locked eyes with the detective leading the interrogation. With a voice dripping with malevolence, I obliged their morbid curiosity.
"It was the eve of my twenty-third birthday," I began, my voice steady and impassive. "A moonless night blanketed the city in shadows, as if the darkness itself had conspired to aid my sinister endeavors. I stalked my unsuspecting victim through the labyrinthine alleyways, relishing in the anticipation of what was to come."
My memory carried me back to that night, the night that ignited the flame, forever warping my twisted mind. The terror gleaming in my victim's eyes as I pounced upon them, the symphony of screams harmonizing with my frenzied laughter.
Their horrified gaze reflected a myriad of emotions - disbelief, fear, and a sense of betrayal by their own existence. It was intoxicatingâ€”the power coursing through my veins like a narcotic substance. The feeling was indescribable, euphoric even, as I watched the life gradually extinguish from their trembling body.
The detective leaned in closer, an unsettling glimmer of curiosity sparked within their eyes. "Why?" they asked, desperately seeking the rationale behind my heinous acts.
A haunting smile lingered on my lips as I replied, "Because the world needed to know the darkness that resides within its heart. My killings were merely decrypted messages, written in blood, exposing the true nature of humanity."
The room fell into an unnerving silence, pregnant with horror and the weight of my admission. The authorities had captured me, but they had only unraveled a fraction of my wicked story. My tale, with its chapters steeped in blood, would forever stain their minds and haunt their dreams.
