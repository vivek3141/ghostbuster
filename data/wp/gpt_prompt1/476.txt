The day started like any other, until I stumbled upon an old, dusty book in the attic. Curiosity gripped me as I delved into its mystical pages, hoping for a glimpse of wonders. But as the truth unfolded, disappointment swallowed me whole. My heart sank realizing that magic was nothing more than mere fiction, an illusion built upon imagination. The world became colorless, robbed of enchantment. Yet, amidst the shattered dreams, a new spark ignited within me. The day I found out magic wasn't real became the day I decided to create my own, to chase wonders and weave tales, bringing magic to life.
