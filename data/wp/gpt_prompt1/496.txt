In a clandestine laboratory deep beneath the city, a "burner" named Leo was born. Genetically modified for chaos, his veins surged with adrenaline, his mind untamed with mischief. As Leo grew, chaos fueled his every step, destruction his sole purpose. Chaos became the headlines, the stories that news networks craved. But within Leo, a spark of humanity flourished, a longing for purpose beyond creating chaos. With the power of his chaos, he strived to expose the truth, to challenge the networks' hunger for sensationalism. And in doing so, Leo ignited a revolution - reclaiming his destiny, redefining his purpose.
