As the cold blade glinted ominously in the dimly lit alley, my heart raced with fear. Time seemed to slow as panic threatened to consume me. Yet, instead of surrendering to terror, an audacious thought pierced through. Sliding my trembling hand into my pocket, I withdrew a worn pack of cards. The mugger's eyes widened in confusion, momentarily distracted by my unexpected response. Seizing the opportune moment, I flicked my wrist, causing the cards to burst into a mesmerizing flurry. Astonishment momentarily froze the assailant's movements, allowing me to escape the jaws of peril and leave behind a bewildered thief, forever holding a knife that would never strike.
