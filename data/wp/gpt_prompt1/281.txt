In a curse woven with wickedness, a witch stole his heart and left an icy void. His hopes of love turned to frost, unable to thaw beneath his frozen chest. As time passed, his once spirited soul grew colder, numbed by an emotionless existence. Shunned from affection, he hid from the warmth that could melt his icy heart. But within his depths, a glimmer of longing remained, a flicker of hope yearning to be set free. For only when his heart embraces the heat of love, will his frozen facade dissipate, restoring his soul to its long-lost flame.
