The musty scent of old books filled the classroom as I watched my classmates turn the pages of my novel, oblivious to the fact that I was the author. As my English teacher began discussing the book, my heart sank with each misinterpretation.
"The protagonist, Sarah, possesses unimaginable powers," my teacher proclaimed. "But it seems she hasn't mastered her abilities yet."
I clenched my fists, the pages of my dream slowly crumbling beneath his ignorance. My adventures were not just a figment of imaginationâ€”they were my reality! The aliens, magic, and time traveling were not just fantastical elements; they represented the struggles and triumphs of my own life.
His analysis continued, veering even further from the truth. "The character, Mr. Orion, represents Sarah's desire to break free from the confines of society and fulfill her dreams." Mr. Orion was an alien who had taught me invaluable lessons about sacrifice and friendship, and yet my teacher reduced him to a mere metaphor.
With a surge of determination, I raised my hand, hesitantly hoping to interrupt the lecture. But my teacher's dismissive glance crippled my voice. I knew he would never truly understand.
As the class neared the end of the book, my mind swirled with frustration. My story was so much more than what my English teacher could grasp. It was a testament to the resilience of human spirit, an exploration of the extraordinary hidden within each of us.
One day, I promised myself, I would reveal my secret. Until then, the true depth of my adventures would remain hidden beneath the surface, waiting for someone who could truly see and understand the worlds I had woven together.
