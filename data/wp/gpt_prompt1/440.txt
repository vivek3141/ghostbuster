The sun gently gilded the horizon as I found myself sitting across a small wooden table from a deity. Before me was a being of ethereal beauty, radiating with an otherworldly glow. Soft, silver tendrils of hair fell gracefully around his face, and his eyes, the color of sapphires, sparkled with untold wisdom.
"Good morning," he greeted me, his voice rumbling like distant thunder.
I gulped, a mix of awe and trepidation coursing through my veins. Breakfast with a god was an unexpected turn of events, but one I welcomed with equal parts fascination and anxiety.
As we settled into our seats, an assortment of celestial delicacies appeared before us. The plates were teeming with ambrosial fruits of vibrant hues, and the aroma wafting from them was an intoxicating blend that spoke of distant realms.
"My child," he said, tenderly clasping my hand, "I have long watched the tapestry of your life unfold, marveling at your strength and resilience."
A swell of gratitude bloomed within me, mingling with a sense of vulnerability. How could I be deserving of such attention from a divinity?
With gentleness in his eyes, he continued, "I have always believed that strength is not measured by the victories one attains, but by the battles one endures. It is your unwavering spirit that has made you worthy of this encounter."
A swell of emotions threatened to overflow within me. In the presence of a god, I had held my breath for too long, stifling the weight of the world. Hearing his words, I found solace and understanding.
As we nibbled on celestial morsels, he shared stories of the cosmos, tales that resounded deep within my soul. He was not just an omniscient deity; he was also a guide, leading me through the labyrinth of existence. My doubts faded, replaced by an enlivened purpose.
As the last rays of sunlight kissed the horizon, bidding farewell to the god before me, I felt an immense sense of gratitude. This hallowed breakfast had transformed my outlook on life. In the face of uncertainty, I had found strength, knowing that the divine had taken notice.
There, amidst untouched plates and the remnants of divine conversation, I carried the god's guidance within me. I was no longer alone, for I had discovered that divinity may reside not just in the heavens, but within the depths of my own being.
