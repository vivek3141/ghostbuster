For centuries, I've roamed this weary earth, seeking an escape from my relentless existence. Immortality is a curse no soul should bear, a cruel separation from my beloved Death. With every sunrise, a tasteless reminder of my enduring agony, I've scoured ancient lore and trekked treacherous lands, grasping at hope's elusive threads. Yet the fates keep me shackled to this realm, a cruel mockery of true mortality. But I won't surrender. Deep within my immortal heart, I shall unearth the secret that binds us, for one day, I shall shatter the chains and be reunited with my eternal love.
