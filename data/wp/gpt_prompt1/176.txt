In the kingdom of Astora, I am Enna, bestowed with a rare gift: the power to possess dragons. Engulfed in wings of fire, I soar through the azure skies, forging an unbreakable bond with these majestic beasts. Together, we defend the realm from dark forces and embark on perilous quests. But as the kingdom trembles under the shadow of an evil sorcerer, the true extent of my abilities is tested. With unwavering determination, I must learn to command not only the dragons but also the dormant power within myself, for the fate of Astora hangs in the balance.
