Through the ages, this enchanted lamp has kindled countless hopes and whispered dreams. Guided by my boundless magic, it has witnessed the emergence of empires, sunsets on ancient civilizations, and the birth of new worlds. It has granted desires for wealth, love, and power. I watched kings rise and fall, lovers unite and part, dreams bloom and shatter. I have seen wishes bring joy, heartache, and redemption. Yet, amidst the tumult of human existence, this enduring lamp has revealed a universal truth: the power to transform resides not in three wishes, but in the infinite capacity of the human heart.
