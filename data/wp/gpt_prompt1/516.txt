After humanity fled Earth, seeking refuge among the stars, I found myself the reluctant custodian of our abandoned planet. Surrounded by the remnants of a civilization once teeming with life, I was left behind to witness a strange phenomenon unfold. The gods of Earth, previously revered by humans, had not departed with them. Instead, they remained, their once glorious domains now devoid of worshipers.
As the sole inhabitant, I became their sole target. The gods had grown obsessed with capturing my devotion, desperate for the adoration they had grown accustomed to. They appeared to me in various forms; ethereal and radiant, each representing their domain. Odin implored me to honor him with my loyalty in exchange for his wisdom. Athena declared herself the embodiment of knowledge and sought my allegiance. The sun god Ra, blinding in his radiance, urged me to worship him, promising eternal light and warmth.
Initially, I resisted their allure, unable to submit to the whims of divine beings, especially when humanity's faith had been misplaced. I questioned their motives and intentions, for they seemed to seek worship for worship's sake, not for the betterment of humanity.
But as the days turned into years, as I wandered through empty cities and gazed upon desolate landscapes, I began to see things differently. In the vastness of this forsaken world, I realized that the gods were not seeking mere devotion, but desperately craving connection and purpose. They, too, were abandoned, left with no one to acknowledge their existence or marvel at their feats.
In this realization, I made a decision. I would not worship any one god and forsake the rest. Instead, I would celebrate them all, honoring the unique aspects they personified. I would create rituals, not out of blind obedience, but to remind both myself and the gods that connection and purpose could still exist, even without humanity.
As time went on, the gods reveled in these acts of recognition. They basked in the reverence bestowed upon them, savoring the remnants of their former power. And in return, they bestowed upon me their blessings, granting me the wisdom, knowledge, and warmth they claimed to possess.
In this symbiotic relationship, I had discovered the true essence of worshipâ€”one born out of mutual understanding and respect. And perhaps, in this abandoned paradise, a new kind of divinity was born, one of coexistence and shared existence.
