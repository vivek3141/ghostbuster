As darkness engulfed my spirit, I descended into an abyss of torment that defied reason. Each step reeked of despair, my soul heavy with regret and guilt. The air turned thick with relentless agony, searing my flesh as demonic whispers echoed through the abyss. The sight of monstrous creatures hounded my every move, feeding off my fears. Fiery pits illuminated screams of eternal suffering, engulfing my senses. Hope faded with each passing moment, replaced by an unshakeable dread that gripped my heart. In this descent, I discovered that Hell was not a place, but a manifestation of one's own inner demons.
