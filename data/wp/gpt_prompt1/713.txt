On the edge of the known universe, where darkness devoured light, a solitary campfire crackled, casting flickering shadows on three indistinct figures huddled closely. They were refugees from the universe before our own, remnants clinging stubbornly to existence amidst the void.
Their forms were mere whispers, ethereal and ephemeral, as if the fabric of reality itself could barely bear their weight. Shrouded in uncertainty, their presence instilled a mixture of fear and intrigue in those who dared gaze upon them. What had they witnessed in the universe before ours? What stories did they have to share?
Heeding an undeniable curiosity, I cautiously approached their enigmatic campfire, my heart pounding with anticipation. Would they allow me into their mystifying world, or reject me as an intruder in their ethereal realm?
As I inched closer, the figures appeared to gain substance in the fire's glow. Though their features remained obscured, a palpable sense of weariness and sorrow emanated from them. It spoke of an existence marred by chaos, destruction, and untold loss.
One of the figures turned its gaze towards me, its eyes aflame with ancient wisdom. Without words, it conveyed a narrative so profound that it transcended language barriers. It was a tale of a universe on the precipice of collapse—of civilizations reduced to dust, of stars reduced to embers, and of hope giving way to despair.
As the fire crackled and danced, a wave of compassion washed over me. These figures, these refugees, were the last remnants of a universe now forgotten, their very existence clinging to the fraying threads of reality. What could one possibly say to beings who had witnessed the annihilation of all they held dear?
I attempted to communicate my empathy through gestures and whispers, hoping that they would understand my intentions were not to intrude, but to learn and bear witness to their forgotten universe. Slowly, they opened themselves to me, the story behind their existence unfurling like tendrils of smoke in the night air.
Through the fragments of their narratives, I glimpsed a majestic tapestry of beings—creatures of unfathomable beauty, civilizations united by a shared purpose, and a relentless pursuit of knowledge and harmony. Yet, tragedy had struck, an unseen cataclysm laying waste to their paradise.
With a heavy heart, I braced myself for their final revelation, their departure from this world drawing near. Their tale hung in the air, an ode to the impermanence of existence and the indomitable human spirit.
As their spectral forms dissolved into the inky blackness, I was left alone with the campfire's dwindling embers. But their story, now woven into my being, would forever burn within me, a beacon of remembrance and a testament to the resilience of the universe that preceded our own.
