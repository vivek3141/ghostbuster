In a land of legends, where waves crashed like thunder,
Lay an island of dragons, where their dreams were not plundered.
Guarded by fierce women, with hearts bold and grand,
They sailed through the tempest, sword gripped in their hands.
Marie the Mighty, ruler of land and of sea,
Her voice like a tempest, commanded the free.
With fiery hair and a gaze sharp like steel,
She tamed dragons with kindness, their wounds to heal.
Next came Bella the Brave, a warrior unmatched,
With a heart full of courage, and a spirit unlatched.
Her spear always ready, to protect and to guide,
With dragons at her side, they sailed the high tide.
And then there was Sophia, a master of the sky,
With wings made of moonlight, she'd forever fly.
Her song, a sweet melody, reached the dragon's soul,
Guiding them with grace, towards a destiny untold.
The island they guarded, a haven so rare,
A sanctuary for dragons, where they'd soar through the air.
With emerald-green mountains and waters so blue,
Legends were born on this island, tales as old as the dew.
Men sailed from afar in hopes to steal dragon's gold,
Their greed bringing chaos, their hearts bitter and cold.
But Marie, Bella, and Sophia stood tall,
Defending the dragons, protecting them all.
They fought with valor, courage burning like fire,
Their voices united, an anthem of desire.
To preserve this haven, where dragons could roam,
Forever protecting, their spirits would roam.
So raise up your voices, all sailors at sea,
Sing of the island where dragons roam wild and free.
Sing of Marie, Bella, and Sophia so brave,
Whose love for these creatures, could tame the roughest wave.
And as the sea shanty reaches far and wide,
The world learns of the island, with dragons by its side.
Marie, Bella, and Sophia, their legend now known,
A tale of fierce women, and the island they called home.
