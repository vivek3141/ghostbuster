With calloused hands, he swept away despair, determined to conquer chaos. The world lay in ashes, its pulse fading. Yet, he painted light with every sweeping stroke, weaving hope through the ruins. For he knew that even in the face of annihilation, a broom could be a symbol of resilience. And with each gentle sweep, he whispered to the winds, "This is not the end; it is a new awakening."
