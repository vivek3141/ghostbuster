As an author tasked with the extraordinary responsibility of keeping Hitler safe until his final judgment, I am faced with a moral quandary unlike any I have encountered before. How can one reconcile the utter devastation, suffering, and loss caused by this man with the duty to ensure his safety in the afterlife?
Stepping onto the shores of the River Styx, I am greeted by the sorrowful cries of the millions who perished in World War II. Their anguish reverberates through each wave that rolls onto the shore, demanding retribution for their stolen lives. This chorus of souls compels me to reconsider my objective, questioning whether the preservation of Hitler's safety is just or righteous.
But if Hitler's soul were to be consumed by the wrathful spirits of those he wronged, would justice truly be served? Would this not reduce his judgment to mere vengeance, relinquishing the divine authority to decide the fate of the damned? I must resist this dangerous temptation and fulfill my mission with impartiality, however repugnant it may be.
To shield him from the relentless fury of the dead, I employ supernatural artifice to veil his form, rendering him invisible and intangible. I guide him through the treacherous passages of the afterlife, past the specters of Auschwitz, the haunting cries of Hiroshima, and the desolate wastelands of scorched earth.
Along this journey, I recount to him the stories of those he condemned to suffering and death, hoping to awaken even the slightest ember of remorse deep within him. In the presence of the great philosophers and poets who reside on the shores, I implore them to reach out to this tormented soul, offering a chance at redemption.
As we draw closer to his final judgment, I witness glimpses of lingering regret in his eyes, a flicker of recognition for the unforgivable harm he inflicted. But whether these embers can grow into sincere repentance, only the divine judges can determine.
In fulfilling my role, I recognize that saving Hitler from the wrath of the deceased does not equate to absolution. It is an act of duty, driven by a desire for a just reckoning and the preservation of divine order. As we reach the threshold of his final judgment, it is not for me to decide his fate, nor for us to forget the magnitude of his crimes.
