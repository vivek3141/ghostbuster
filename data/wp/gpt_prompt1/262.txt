In a world governed by the ominous numbers etched on our chests, I lived haunted by the burden of taking a single life. But when my scarlet digit abruptly transformed, trembling beneath my touch, I was shattered. The weight of three million lives crushed my soul, drowning me in a sea of despair. How could I bear this gruesome prophecy, this monstrous tally? Thoughts of remorse and redemption wrestled within me, as my heart yearned to defy destiny. Determined, I vowed to dedicate every fiber of my existence to molding a brighter future, where no numbers would dictate our very humanity.
