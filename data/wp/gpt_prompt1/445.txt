Desperate for answers, I scoured the vast knowledge of the internet, only to find no mention of such an occurrence. Fear and isolation gripped me as I realized I was alone in my newfound predicament. Was this a glitch? Or something greater? One thing was certain: the world had changed, and I was at its center, a solitary anomaly in a sea of numbers.
