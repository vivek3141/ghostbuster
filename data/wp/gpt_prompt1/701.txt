Henry sat at a corner table of the quaint restaurant, sipping his coffee. He couldn't help but steal glances at the waiter. There was something strangely familiar about him, a resemblance to the infamous figure of history. Yet, Henry reassured himself, how likely was it for a genocidal dictator to be serving coffee in a small town diner?
Over time, he noticed the waiter's gentle disposition and warm smile, traits that seemed incongruous with his similarities to Hitler. Still, doubt persisted, and Henry's curiosity got the better of him.
One day, as the diner closed, Henry approached the waiter. Sweating with anticipation, he asked, "Excuse me, I hope I'm not being disrespectful, but I can't help but notice your resemblance to someone... someone notorious."
The waiter, startled but composed, sighed. "Ah, yes. I'm aware of the resemblance. Many people have mentioned it before." He paused, glancing at the emptiness around them. "But please understand, I am not Hitler."
Curiosity piqued, Henry leaned closer. "Then, who are you? What's your story?"
With a mixture of relief and sadness, the waiter began to unfold his past. He was the great-nephew of Hitler, a family whose name was forever tainted. He had painstakingly devoted his life to breaking away from that shadow, striving to counter hate with kindness.
As Henry listened, he realized that appearances alone could never define a person's character. He pondered the weight of prejudice and the immense importance of empathy and understanding.
Leaving the diner that night, Henry was no longer 90% certain. Now, he was 100% certain that labels and resemblances could never truly capture a person's essence.
