As I took my last gasp, a strange sensation overcame me. Blinking, I found myself standing in a grand hall, my loved ones nearby. Puzzled, I glanced down to see a polished wooden chest in my hands, shimmering with mystery. Rumors whispered it held the riches of the afterlife. Excitement grew within, but as I opened it, only mundane objects spilled out â€“ laughter, memories, kindness. I realized then that the true worth was not in material possessions, but in the intangible, the immutable beauty of a life well lived. I departed, content in knowing my legacy was made of priceless treasures.
