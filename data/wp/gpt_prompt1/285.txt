For over a millennium, I have walked this Earth, bearing witness to the rise and fall of empires, the evolution of societies, and the ebb and flow of humanity itself. It is a peculiar existence, being an ordinary person in an extraordinary circumstance. Immortality, a gift neither earned nor chosen, has saddled me with a burden few could fathom.
As the clocks tick and the years pass, I find myself confined within the glass walls of corporate America, a world of monotony and fluorescent lights. The faces come and go, the fashions change, but the human condition remains a constant. My perspective on life, however, is far from ordinary.
I reminisce on the wonders I have seen, the great minds I have encountered, and the cultures I have immersed myself in. I bear the weight of forgotten knowledge, the secrets of ancient civilizations which lie buried deep within me. But in this era of efficiency and productivity, my wisdom is rendered obsolete. My millennium of existence, reduced to a mere cog in the corporate machine.
Yet, there are moments when I find solace amidst the monotony. A quiet coffee break where I can glimpse the fleeting beauty of existence. A brief conversation with a colleague that reminds me of the value of human connection. In these instances, I am reminded that my immortality, though a heavy burden, is also a precious gift.
As the days turn into years, I yearn for a purpose that extends beyond spreadsheets and meetings. I strive to find meaning in this modern world, to leave a mark that will transcend time. For though I may be ordinary, my millennium of existence has molded me into something extraordinary.
