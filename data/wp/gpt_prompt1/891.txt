I jolted upright, heart pounding, as my roommate's urgent grip shook me from sleep. "What's wrong?" I managed to croak, confused and still half-dreaming. Their eyes gleamed with fear. "There's no time!" they whispered, panic lacing their words. I blinked, struggling to grasp their meaning. "What do you mean?" I demanded. Their voice quivered as they replied, "I woke up today, and time doesn't exist anymore!" My mind whirled with disbelief. How could time vanish? Somehow, I knew this was no dream. With uncertainty gripping my soul, I took their trembling hand. Together, we braced for the unknown.
