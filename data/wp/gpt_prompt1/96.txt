Title: The Delegation of Divine Duty
Once upon a time, in a realm where faith and miracles coexisted, God had an exceptionally dedicated personal assistant named Gary. In all matters related to prayer answering, God had entrusted Gary with absolute autonomy, confident in his competence. Day in and day out, Gary tirelessly sifted through countless prayers, responding with grace, compassion, and divine intervention.
Despite his complete authority, one fateful morning, Gary opened his inbox to find a prayer that left him perplexed. It was unlike any request he had ever encountered, and he knew deep down that he needed God's advice to provide a suitable response. With a reverent heart, Gary made his way to the ethereal chamber where God resided.
Entering the celestial room, Gary knelt before the majestic presence of his master. "My Lord," he whispered, "I come to seek your guidance on an extraordinary prayer that has found its way into my hands."
God, His eyes shimmering with interest, nodded gently. "Speak, dear Gary. Share this puzzling request with me."
Taking a long breath to steady himself, Gary presented the prayer with trembling hands. "Almighty One, this prayer is entangled with complexity and profound longing. It seeks guidance amidst heart-wrenching choices, love, and the uncertainties of life."
God leaned in, His eternal wisdom poised to unravel the mysteries contained within the prayer. "Tell me, Gary, what are the words that have captivated your very soul?"
Gary began, his voice filled with awe, "O Divine Father, hear my plea. I stand at the crossroads, tormented by the undue weight of undying love. My heart yearns for two souls, each entwined with their distinctive virtues, yet both call upon the depths of my affections."
God stroked His chin thoughtfully as He pondered the complexity of human emotions. "Gary, love is the essence that binds all of creation together. It is a powerful force that shapes destinies and transforms lives. How often have mortals sought guidance on matters of love? Yet this strife you speak of is distinct, layered with a tapestry of devotion and longing."
"Indeed, my Lord," Gary affirmed. "But this prayer seeks guidance not only for one's own joy but also for the happiness of the two souls caught within this tender triangle. It begs for the wisdom to safeguard their hearts, their futures, even if it should require personal sacrifice."
God's eyes reflected a twinkle as He gazed upon Gary. "Gary when I chose you as my assistant, I knew your capacity for empathy; your gentle spirit had always been a beacon of compassion."
Gary lowered his head humbly, overwhelmed by the honor bestowed upon him. "My Lord, I implore you, guide me in the right direction. This prayer carries the weight of souls entangled in both joy and suffering."
God's voice resonated with divine tranquility. "Gary, you are my extension, bestowed with the power to grant miracles that abide by the laws of love and compassion. Ponder deeply upon the prayer, for within the depths of your being, my voice I shall impart."
Taking a moment to absorb God's words, Gary embraced the trust and the weight of responsibility. Leaving the celestial chamber, the vastness of his office felt both immense and transformative. For weeks, he sought solitude, meditating upon the prayer, longing for divine clarity.
Finally, Gary emerged, resolute in his decision. He had crafted a response that truly echoed God's wisdom. With trembling fingers, he wrote:
"Beloved Child of the Divine, your heartfelt plea resonates through the very essence of creation. Love, at times, is a tapestry more intricate than our human understanding perceives. It is a delicate dance, and your willingness to safeguard not only your own happiness but also that which binds the souls you cherish is a testament to the strength of your love.
In this realm where miracles manifest through equals parts belief and compassion, I beseech you to embark upon a path of self-reflection and noble truth. Seek the whispers of your own heart, for there lies the wellspring of divine guidance. Trust in your capacity to make decisions that honor both your own soul and the souls of those you cherish.
Remember, dear child, that life is a journey intertwined with both joy and pain. Let this experience be an opportunity for growth, compassion, and understanding. As you navigate the river of love, may your choices reflect the divinity that resides within you, and may the ripple of your courage touch the lives of all you encounter.
With eternal blessings and divine love, 
Gary, Messenger of God"
And so, Gary, in his unfathomable wisdom, called upon the heart of the universe itself—the love and compassion embodied by God—to guide a soul through the complexities that only the human heart can fathom. Through his response, he would facilitate not just a mere answer but a journey of self-discovery and enlightenment.
For even in a world where prayer answering had been entrusted to a personal assistant, the ultimate power of divine guidance could never be fully delegated.
