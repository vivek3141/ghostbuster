As our spacecraft touched down on the barren expanse of the moon's far side, an eerie silence engulfed us. Intent on starting anew, we anticipated a desolate landscape. But what we found was chilling. Derelict structures, overgrown with lunar dust, stood like ghostly remnants of a forgotten civilization.

Gazing at these ominously abandoned remnants, we realized that history had repeated itself. Determined to rewrite this tale, we vowed to learn from the past and bring life to this desolate moon.
