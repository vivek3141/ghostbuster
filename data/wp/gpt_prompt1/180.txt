As the sun dipped below the horizon for the final time, Sarah gazed at the deserted city below. Tears welled in her eyes as she switched off the last functioning streetlight. The once vibrant metropolis lay in ruins, a ghostly reminder of what once was. With a heavy heart, she walked away, leaving behind years of memories and a world devoid of life. Though the streets now echoed with silence, Sarah carried the hopes and dreams of humanity with her. As she disappeared into the unknown, she whispered, "Goodbye, Earth. May your legacy shine on in the stars."
