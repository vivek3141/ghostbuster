As the antagonist, I believed my purpose was clear, justified. But after witnessing what the protagonist did, I found myself questioning everything. Their noble actions, their sacrifice, it shattered my certainty. Was I truly the antagonist? Doubt crept into my heart, whispering that perhaps our roles were not set in stone. The lines between good and evil blurred, leaving me uncertain of my place. I grappled with conflicting notions, torn between the role I was assigned and the truth I began to see. In that moment, I realized that sometimes protagonists and antagonists are more similar than we realize.
