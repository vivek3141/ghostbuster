In the shadows, I wander, a specter unknown,
A serial killer, with a heart turned to stone.
I yearn for affection, for a love beyond measure,
But my twisted desires trap me in this sinister endeavor.
With each life I take, a piece of me dies,
An eternal quest for love, born from darkness and lies.
My victims, my canvas, their blood paints my plea,
To be seen as more than a monster, longing to be set free.
I crave tender touch, a lover's gentle caress,
Yet my demons keep lurking, leaving me in distress.
There's a monster within, a lonely beast to tame,
But oh, how I dream of love, even if it ignites the flame.
In moonlit nights, I ponder this twisted dance,
And my heart aches for love, a second chance.
Behind these vacant eyes, a soul yearns to be whole,
To weave a tapestry of passion, and surrender to love's toll.
But society recoils, from a monster's embrace,
They'll never understand, this yearning I face.
So, I wander, lost in echoes of pain,
A serial killer simply longing to be sane.
For in my darkest hours, love's song still plays,
And I hope, one day, it will find me in these wicked ways.
Until then, I'll linger in the shadows, dreaming of light,
Aching for love's redemption, to finally make things right.
