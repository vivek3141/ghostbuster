Every day of my marriage to Captain Obvious, I am reminded that there are no surprises. It begins when I awake to his exclamation, "Good morning, my love! It is a new day!" as if I couldn't already tell. The ever-present sunshine of his optimism illuminates our home, as he narrates each mundane activity. "You are now brushing your teeth!" he declares, as if his observation adds some profound insight.
Breakfast is no different; he points out the obvious, "You are eating a bowl of cereal!" I nod and smile politely, pretending that his words don't unravel my sanity thread by thread. As we head out for the day, he astutely remarks, "We are now leaving the house!" as if I wouldn't know that if I weren't walking alongside him.
Even during our outings, his commentary persists. "Look, my dear, it is raining!" he exclaims when droplets fall from the sky. I am tempted to respond, "No, really?" but I refrain, reminding myself that he means well.
As evening sets, I yearn to escape the clutches of Captain Obvious. But even bedtime offers no solace. "You are now climbing into bed," he whispers, his voice full of excitement, before adding, "Sleep well, my love!" as if his mere mention of it will magically make me doze off.
In this marriage to Captain Obvious, life is a non-stop narration of the painfully apparent. But beneath my exasperation, I hold onto gratitude for our adventures together, and the love that Captain Obvious unapologetically expresses each day.
