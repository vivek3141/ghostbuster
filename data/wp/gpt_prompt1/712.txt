As I transcended into the afterlife, a wave of clarity washed over me, bringing with it the realization of the great game that had been played before my birth. Unbeknownst to me, there existed an RPG-esque character creation, wherein I had chosen my attributes, virtues, traits, and skills. But now, in the throes of death, it became painfully evident that I had made all the wrong choices from the very beginning.
I lamented the shortcomings I had inherited, birthed by my own misguided decisions. My heart sank when I realized I had squandered my potential, neglecting my intellect and focusing solely on physical prowess. My agility, strength, and dexterity could have been utilized for noble causes, yet I had wasted them on selfish endeavours.
The virtues I possessed seemed distant and foreign, with humility overshadowed by pride, compassion overshadowed by indifference. Altruism had become a long-lost dream, buried beneath layers of apathy and callousness.
The traits I had once embraced now echoed with regret. My tendency towards impulsiveness had led me down a path of reckless decisions, causing irreversible harm to myself and others. In the pursuit of instant gratification, I had forsaken the wisdom of patience and forethought.
Oh, the natural skills I had chosen! I had failed to nurture my artistic abilities, stifling the creative sparks within my soul. My voice, once intended to inspire, had been silenced by the chains of self-doubt and fear.
In this moment of reckoning, I yearned for a chance to reincarnate, to redraw my path with the thumbprints of wisdom. But as the ethereal echoes of regret lingered, I resolved to embrace the lessons learned from this ephemeral existence, vowing to live my next life with purpose, making all the right choices from the very beginning.
