Before we permit the human race to ascend into the infinite expanse of the stars, it is crucial to acknowledge the flaws that define us. Our insatiable thirst for power has bred innumerable conflicts, drenching our history in bloodshed. We ravage the Earth, exploiting its resources with reckless abandon, heedless of the consequences. Our blind pursuit of individual gain has created a chasm of inequality, where countless suffer while few thrive. And yet, within these faults, lies hope. For we possess the capacity to change, to learn from the past, and strive for a future where our flaws do not define us.
