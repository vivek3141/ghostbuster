Every morning, my eyes flutter open to reveal a new world, a new life. It has been my bizarre reality for as long as I can remember. Each day, I awaken as someone completely different, thrust into a different time period. I have witnessed the rise and fall of empires, experienced the horrors of war, and felt the overwhelming changes of progress.
But the last three days have been different. The familiar ache in my bones that heralds a transition has been absent. I lay motionless as the unforgiving hands of time halted their relentless march. My heart swells with both relief and confusion. 
The first day without change felt like a blessing, a respite from the constant uncertainty that plagued my existence. I savored the comfort of waking up to the same face I had known for ages, the one I had forgotten in the constant shuffle. The second day was met with curiosity, an exploration of what it felt like to be stagnant when I had grown so accustomed to flux.
By the third day, unease had begun to gnaw at my spirit. The gift of stability, once cherished, now became a heavy burden. I yearned for the sensation of being transported through time, for the thrill of adapting to new customs and societies. The repetitive solitude weighed heavily on my soul.
As the fourth day dawns, uncertainty reigns. Has this been the culmination of my journey? Or is it merely a lull before another tempest of temporal change? I brace myself for the unknown, for whatever bizarre whim the universe will bestow upon me.
