Astonished, she surveyed the ancient city, her mind racing to comprehend the impossible. It dawned on her that her unforeseen journey had taken her to the heart of the Roman Empire, a place no history book had ever described.
With her heart pounding, Hermione sought refuge in the shadows, acutely aware that her British accent and uniquely magical abilities could arouse suspicion. Gathering her wits, she decided to utilize her vast knowledge of Roman history to navigate this foreign world and ensure her survival.

Yet, as the empire thrived under Hermione's enlightened rule, a wave of discontent rose among the traditionalists—the conservative elite who feared her magical power and the unconventional ideologies she introduced. Conspiracies schemed within the Roman Senate, threatening Hermione's hard-fought reign of peace and prosperity.
Unbeknownst to her adversaries, Hermione's Time-Turner, which had shattered all those years ago, had a final twist in store. As darkness loomed and her grip on power began to loosen, Hermione discovered a way to weave time, summoning her own self from the past.
