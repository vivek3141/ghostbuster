But her happiness lay intertwined with another; a marriage built on duty and responsibility. Max's love for her grew with each stolen glance, their conversations always fleeting. Their connection, a parallel universe where two souls dared to dream. And so, he remained by her side, a silent guardian of her happiness, knowing he could never claim the heart he cherished. Their love remained locked away, an eternal ache hidden beneath smiles and unspoken words.
