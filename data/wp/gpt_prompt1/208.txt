As an author, my frustration grew with each passing day. My writing prompts stood abandoned, like lonely islands in the sea of indifference. I poured my heart into enticing words, longing for even the faintest response. But the silence, deafening and disheartening, echoed through the depths of my soul. Doubt gnawed at me, questioning my worth. Yet, amid the darkness, a flicker of determination emerged. I would persist, sharing my stories with the world, whether they be read or not. For deep down, I knew that the act of creation itself was the greatest reward, unyielding to the silence that lingered.
