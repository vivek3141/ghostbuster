As I watched my parents bring home my baby sister, I marveled at her innocence. But as the years unfolded, it became clear that she was different. Days turned into weeks, weeks into years, yet her cherubic face remained unchanged. Friends distanced themselves out of fear, mistaken for jealousy. Time played tricks on our perceptions, and whispers of immortality swirled around our home. While my sister became an enigma, I grew alongside her, grappling with the complexities of life. Together, we embarked on a journey of isolation and acceptance, finding solace in each other's eternal presence and cherishing the beauty of a life without aging.
