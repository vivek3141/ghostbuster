In the stillness of Eden's dawn, a solitary figure emerged from the depths of the forest. Her name was Rose, a young woman with eyes as vibrant as sapphires, burdened by a deep secret. Feb had always been a month of sorrow for her, a reminder of love lost. But today, as the sun cast its gentle glow, hope awakened within her. With faded scars as her testament and courage as her armor, Rose vowed to embrace the beauty and possibilities this new day held. In this elusive sanctuary, she would find rebirth and create her own masterpiece.
