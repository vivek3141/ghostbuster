John continued reading, his heart pounding. Suddenly, deafening thunder and vivid flashes of lightning echoed through the room. The words leapt from the page, swirling, shimmering, and melding with reality. Panic ensnared him as he realized he was trapped inside the story. Desperate, he searched for a way out. With a gasp, the book slammed shut, sealing John's fate. Forever trapped, lost in a realm of his own creation.
