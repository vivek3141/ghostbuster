As I sat at my desk, contemplating the next chapter of my novel, I found myself reflecting on the question posed during last week's SatChat. Do I outline or just start writing? An age-old debate among authors, which I too grappled with throughout my career.
For me, the answer lies somewhere in between. Though I have great admiration for those who can simply dive into a blank page and let their imagination flow, I find solace in outlining the contours of my story. It provides me with a blueprint, a roadmap from which I can deviate, should inspiration strike.
Like a sculptor before a block of marble, I sketch out the main plot points, the twists and turns that will guide my narrative. This outline anchors my ideas, clarifying the story's structure, character arcs, and themes. However, I do not restrict myself to its rigid lines. Writing is a fluid art, and sometimes, the story veers off course, taking unexpected turns that no outline could have predicted.
Writing is a delicate dance between meticulous planning and liberating improvisation. It is the marriage of discipline and creativity, structure and spontaneity. Outlining allows me to feel secure in my foundation, providing a sense of direction, while leaving enough room for the characters to breathe and evolve independently.
So, let the self-proclaimed 'pantsers' dive into the unknown, discovering a story as they go. As for me, I find comfort in my outline, knowing that while the path may alter, the destination will remain true.
