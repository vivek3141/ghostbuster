The Facility stood hidden within the dense forest, a formidable structure housing mankind's greatest secret. Deep in its bowels, a pulsating force lay confined within steel walls. God.
Fear twisted the hearts of those who encountered its horrifying presence. The once-colorful walls sagged, stripped of all life, as an unholy aura suffocated every corner. Its mere existence permeated the air, leaving a chilling, otherworldly energy that stirred uneasiness in the souls of those who dared to venture near.
The captured deity, stripped of its divine majesty, thrashed violently against its shackles, emitting a cacophony of anguished wails. Its monstrous silhouette writhed in agony, each bellow echoing through the Facility's hallowed corridors. The minds of the researchers tasked with studying it gradually eroded under the weight of its anguish.
As weeks bled into months, sanity escaped the grasp of its captors. Whispers of malevolent secrets slithered within their minds, unraveling the fabric of their reality. Hallucinations danced before their eyes, distorting their perception of the world. Terrifying manifestations of their darkest nightmares creeped through the shadows, patiently awaiting their turn.
Desperation gnawed at their crumbling sanity, driving them to release the captured deity, hoping to alleviate the torment they had unleashed. But as the final chains fell, unleashing God upon an unsuspecting world, they realized their profound mistake. For in the horror that followed, humanity was confronted with a truth more terrifying than any devilish creation conjured by their imagination: the wrath of a vengeful God, no longer bound by the will of mortals.
