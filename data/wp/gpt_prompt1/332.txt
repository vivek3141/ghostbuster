In the depths of my mind, a childhood memory resides,
A place of innocence, where joy and wonder collide.
The rhythm of laughter echoes through sunlit days,
As carefree hearts dance in a nostalgic haze.
The scent of freshly cut grass beneath bare feet,
Flowers blooming, painting the world so sweet.
Chasing dreams on twilight nights, beneath a starry sky,
Time stood still as friendships blossomed, oh so high.
Though years may pass, that memory forever shall remain,
A treasure embraced, casting away every pain.
