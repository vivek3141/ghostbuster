In the secluded village of Ethereal Hollow, the line between legend and reality blurred. It was said that dragons roamed the mountains, their majestic wings painting the horizon. Yet, when the townspeople spoke of them, "a few" dragons was their vague and poetic expression, veiling the objective truth. As a chronicler of tales, I took it upon myself to unravel their mystique and set the record straight. Through meticulous observations, I discovered that precisely three dragons soared above Ethereal Hollow, leaving no room for ambiguity. From that day forth, the villagers understood the importance of clarity, and "a few" was forever replaced by the objective truth.
