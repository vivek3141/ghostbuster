In ethereal whispers, a secret did dwell,
A tale of enchantment, I must now unveil.
Amidst shadows deep, where secrets abide,
Lies a truth untold, that none can deride.
In humble abodes, where the moonlight seeps,
A secret worth telling, in dreams it softly creeps.
Fickle like stardust, it dances in disguise,
A touch of magic, hidden within its guise.
Whispers of love, nestled in rose-scented air,
Two hearts intertwined, a clandestine affair.
Unspoken words lingered, like a forgotten song,
Yearning to be sung, as the nights grew long.
In the depths of the forest, where echoes reside,
An ancient oak whispers secrets, unable to hide.
Its leaves rustle softly, its branches reach high,
Bearing witness to tales, cherished 'neath the sky.
A secret worth telling, like a dawn's first light,
Illuminates souls, dispelling the darkest night.
For when truth is spoken, burdens find release,
Offering solace and granting hearts peace.
So gather 'round, eager ears lend an ear,
As this secret unfolds, crystal clear.
A love long forbidden, a forbidden embrace,
Unveiling a story, delicate as lace.
But heed well this tale, and listen with care,
For secrets are fragile, they require repair.
In the telling of truths, we are set free,
A secret worth telling, unravels destiny.
