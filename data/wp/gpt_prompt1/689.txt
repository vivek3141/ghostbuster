Once upon a time, in a world now amiss,
I fell victim to the strangest of curses,
For no longer could I express without rhyme,
Every word I must utter must chime.
With trepidation, I approached my dear boss,
To explain my hex, no matter the cost.
"Dear sir," I began, my voice with dismay,
"I bear this affliction, this rhyming display."
Surprised, he looked at me, eyes wide and aglow,
A chuckle escaped, his laughter all aglow.
"Who needs normal speech?" he declared with a shrug,
"This curse can inspire the most beautiful hug!"
Next came my spouse, whom I held so dear,
With hesitation, I whispered in her ear,
"My love," I crooned, attempting to speak,
"In prose I am trapped, rhyming's all I can leak."
Amusement crept over her lips like a smile,
She twirled around, her eyes full of guile.
"I love your new talent," she proclaimed with cheer,
"For rhyming expressions bring laughter so near."
Finally, my class, young minds eager to learn,
I gathered them close, my heart starting to yearn.
"I have a strange news, my young poets in bloom,
My words shall be bound by rhymes, driving my doom."
Curiosity sparked in their bright, curious gaze,
They giggled and whispered, entranced by the craze.
"To learn through rhyme," they chimed with delight,
"Mayhaps be a blessing, an imaginative flight?"
And so, with my curse, I've embarked on this quest,
To embrace the rhyme, unlock words' behest.
For curses can be, in their own peculiar way,
The catalyst for creativity's playful sway.
