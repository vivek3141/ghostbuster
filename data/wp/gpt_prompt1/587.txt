As the doors slid shut behind him, Jake surveyed the deserted elevator, puzzled by the unexpected sight of a menacing vacuum cleaner. Its sleek design was incongruous amidst the mirrors and polished panels. Suddenly, the vacuum emitted a low hum, its lights flickering ominously. Panic seeped into Jake's bones as the machine grew in size, towering over him like a metallic predator. Gripping the handrail, he watched in horror as the vacuum's nozzle elongated into a gaping maw. Time seemed to stretch as Jake's fate swirled, forever lost in the dark vortex that should have been an ordinary elevator.
