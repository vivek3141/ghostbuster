I always thought being alone was the worst fate, until this day. As I draw my last breath, I realize that my true fear was being forgotten. Tears blur my vision, but I won't let them fall. I was never the strongest or the smartest, but I had a heart bursting with love. I only wished someone would recognize the depth of my affection, that my existence mattered. Alas, my time is up. Remember me, not for my accomplishments, but for the love I carried, untarnished and unconditional, within my fragile soul. Worthless or not, my love was real.
