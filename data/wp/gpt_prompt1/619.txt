As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting its last golden rays across the city, I sat alone in the dimly lit room, contemplating the weight of my years spent as a world-class hitman. Various international assassinations had become routine, executed with precision and finesse. My reputation preceded me, known for making death appear nothing more than natural occurrences. But behind the façade of a steely killer, I was still a human burdened with emotions, haunted by my past choices.
Yet fate, or perhaps a cruel sense of irony, had one final contract in store for me—a contract that struck a nerve that I never thought possible. My employer, a cold and calculating man, handed me a folder containing the details of my last assignment before retirement. My heart sank as I read the name scrawled across the photograph—a name synonymous with love and protection, a name that brought back memories of warm hugs and soothing whispers: Veronica Wilson, my mother.
Confusion and disbelief swept through me in an indescribable wave. How could she be involved in something that would necessitate her elimination? Had the years of secrecy and lies finally caught up with her? I had blindly trusted her, never questioning her actions, all while oblivious to her hidden life.
Yet, despite the overwhelming shock, I knew well enough that emotions were a precarious ally in my line of work. The humming adrenaline, the cool detachment, and the calculated precision—they were the tools of my trade, the very things that separated me from the average man. I had honed these skills, making me a ghost in the shadows, a harbinger of death no one would ever suspect.
But how could I possibly kill my own mother? Was my past merely a facade hiding the monster within? Doubt gnawed at my resolve, latching onto the faint hope that there must be another way, another truth.
With each passing moment, the weight of the decision bore down on me, threatening to crush my soul. In the flickering candlelight, I retraced the path that had led me here, my mind wandering through a labyrinth of memories and regrets. My life had been guided by a relentless determination, a thirst for power, for control, at any cost. But perhaps it had all been a masquerade, a disastrous web of lies spun to shield the truth from me.
Taking a deep breath, I walked over to the window and stared out into the night. The city sprawled before me, a daunting tapestry of life and death, joy and pain. The finality of my impending retirement loomed ahead, whether I chose to fulfill this contract or not. And so, like a pendulum slicing through the smoky air, the decision swung before me—an impossible choice between loyalty to my mother or remaining true to the only profession I had ever known.
In the end, as the assassin's creed dictated, I knew the life I had chosen would never let me escape without spilling blood. The path I had willingly embarked upon had no room for sentiments, no room for exceptions. And so, with a heavy heart, I resolved to complete my mission, accepting the grim reality that awaited me—a reality where I would be forever haunted by regret and driven to find answers in a world that thrived on silence.
Steeling myself, I closed my eyes, feeling the weight of the world crashing upon my frail shoulders. In the morning light, I would begin my final dance with death, praying for a reprieve that could never be granted. It was time to fulfill my fate, my final destiny, both as an assassin and as a son.
