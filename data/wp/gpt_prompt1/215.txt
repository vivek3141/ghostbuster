We've still got time. Not enough, but enough to make things right. The clock's ticking, seconds slipping away, but our hearts are racing against the storm. Hand in hand, we forge through obstacles, defying the odds. Every breath drawn is a promise, every touch shared is a lifeline. Our love, a catalyst for change. With each passing moment, we grow stronger, braver, invincible. Time may be ruthless, stealing moments before we're ready, but as long as we're together, we'll make every second count. We've still got time. Not enough, but enough to create a forever.
