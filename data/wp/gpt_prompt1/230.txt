In the moonlit hour, shadows dance
A whisper calls, a chilling trance
My heart pounds with silent fear
As darkness nears, I sense you're near
Innocence stolen, my life's thread untied
I breathe my last, a tear I cannot hide
Merciless hands, stained red with sin
A twisted fate, where evil begins
Twisted desires drive me to this end
A killer's mask, an eerie blend
Echoes of screams, silenced in gloom
Witness to death, I seal your doom
Two souls entwined, a tragic plight
One finds solace, the other sheer fright
Forever bound, this haunting tale
Of a victim slain, and a killer's wail
