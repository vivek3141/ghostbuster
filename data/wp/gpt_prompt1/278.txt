In a bustling coffee shop, their eyes locked across the room, kindling a fire that burned brighter with each stolen glance. They felt an invisible thread weaving their souls together, though their lives were filled with commitments to others. They yearned for stolen moments, stolen touches. A love so profound, it haunted them even in their dreams. They longed to run away to a world where they were free to surrender to their desires. Yet practicality held them captive, forever resigned to silence, their love left unspoken. With heavy hearts, they lived a lifetime of "what ifs" and unfulfilled love.
