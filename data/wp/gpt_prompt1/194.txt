In the cobbled town, where justice prevailed,
A peculiar law was never curtailed.
As long as one rhymed, in eloquent verse,
All crimes were pardoned, for better or worse.
A quaint little court, with a rusty old bell,
Called all who were summoned, to this strange spell.
With parchments and quills, and robes draped in gold,
The judge presided, his wisdom untold.
A thief named Jack, with nimble fingers so keen,
Stood before the judge, in his tattered sheen.
He spoke with a bow, his eyes full of fear,
In hopes that his words would make the judge cheer.
"Your Honor, dear judge, I stand here today,
Accused of a crime, for which I must pay.
But in self-defense, my actions were bold,
For life I did fight, or so I am told."
His voice was melodic, his words interwoven,
Each syllable spun, like verses set in motion.
With each rhyme, his guilt seemed to unravel,
And the courtroom became a place to marvel.
The crowd was astounded, their jaws on the floor,
As his words painted pictures they all could adore.
The judge nodded, enraptured by the sight,
His notions of justice challenged this night.
"As long as you rhyme, you will be pardoned,
For by your own words, your defense has hardened.
Your actions, fueled by survival's strong thirst,
Shall not be condemned, for you've quenched it first."
With that final rhyme, the room burst into cheer,
The thief named Jack had nothing to fear.
His crimes, now forgiven, within reason and rhyme,
In this peculiar court, justice had chime.
But in the depths of ink, with shadows unbound,
Lay questions unanswered, where wisdom was found.
For though rhymes may charm and hearts may relent,
Do they truly absolve, or merely circumvent?
That little town, where justice was rife,
Shall forever be known, as the realm of the rhyme.
For as long as you verse, and make your words dance,
All crimes would be pardoned, in this charming expanse.
