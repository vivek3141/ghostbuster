As I stepped out of the time machine, my heart sank with realization. This was not the era I had intended to visit. Instead of the vibrant future, I found myself trapped in familiar yet unrecognizable surroundings. The streets were abandoned, buildings were in ruins, and an eerie silence filled the air. Anxiety washed over me, questioning what had gone wrong. The malfunction had thrust me into a desolate wasteland, devoid of the bustling civilization I had envisioned. With no understanding of when or where I was, I could only hope that I hadn't altered history irreparably. My journey to the past had taken an unexpected turn.
