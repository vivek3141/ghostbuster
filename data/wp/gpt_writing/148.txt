Ever since I was a child, I had heard stories about the mark. The mark was a symbol of hope, the promise of a soulmate destined to cross paths with you. It was said that everyone was born with a mark around their wrist, a color that matched the hue of their soulmate's mark. The color could change as we grew and evolved, reflecting the changes within us. For as long as I could remember, my mark had always been a striking shade of blue.
I had turned 14 when the blue mark first appeared. It was a moment of pure exhilaration and curiosity. I wondered who my soulmate could be, whether they shared my love for books or possessed the same inquisitive mind. I was eager to unravel the mysteries and find that person who would complete me.
Years passed, and my mark remained an unwavering blue, never faltering or changing shades. While my friends excitedly spoke of the vibrant colors that had transformed over time, I grew accustomed to my constant hue. It became my companion, an extension of my identity.
One night, while wandering through the bustling city streets, a strange feeling overtook me. It was as if every gaze that met mine held an inquisitive curiosity. People whispered and pointed, their eyes filled with surprise and confusion. Puzzled by their reaction, I unknowingly reached towards my wrist, where my mark had always resided. To my utter disbelief, it was gone.
A profound sense of loss washed over me, an emptiness that I had never felt before. The world suddenly seemed different and unfamiliar. Panic coursed through my veins as I searched for an explanation. How could my mark disappear? Was there something wrong with me?
Days turned into weeks, and the absence of my mark weighed heavily upon me. I became consumed by the mystery, losing sleep and neglecting my usual routines. Determined to unveil the truth, I embarked on a journey to discover what had happened to my soulmate connection.
Through countless hours of research, I stumbled upon a forgotten tale—an ancient legend whispered among the oldest of souls. It spoke of a remarkable encounter, a phenomenon so rare that it was almost mythical. There were tales of a bond so profound that even the mark would fade, revealing a connection beyond the realm of colors.
With newfound hope pulsating within me, I delved deeper and discovered accounts of those who had experienced a transcendent love—one where the mark vanished to signify an extraordinary connection that surpassed the boundaries of mere appearance or color.
I realized that I was not alone. Others had walked this path before, defying the expectations of society. My heart fluttered with anticipation and newfound courage. Perhaps, just perhaps, my soulmate was among those who shared this extraordinary bond.
With each passing day, I felt a growing resolve. The loss of my mark had not shattered me but had ignited a fire deep within my soul. Armed with an unwavering belief in love that defied convention, I set out on a journey that would bring the mark back, not around my wrist, but within the confines of my heart.
And so, I walked forward, ready to embrace a love that was as limitless and boundless as the sky. I welcomed the idea of a connection that went beyond mere physical appearances. For in the absence of a mark, I discovered a mark of my own—a mark of the strength and resilience that resided within me.
