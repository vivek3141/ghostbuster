I was only 23 the first time they tried to kill me. They were stunned when it didn't work. You see, I have always had a peculiar gift - an innate ability to sense danger. Call it intuition or sixth sense, whatever you will, but it has kept me alive and tiptoed me around the perils of life.
It was a late summer evening when it happened, the first attempt on my life. As I walked along the dimly lit alley behind my apartment building, a chilling wind cut through the air, sending shivers down my spine. A shadowy figure emerged from the darkness, blending seamlessly with the night. I instinctively halted, my senses tingling with alarm. I knew danger lurked ahead.
With a quick, fluid motion, the figure lunged toward me, a gleaming blade reflecting the pale moonlight. I evaded the attack by inches, feeling the rush of air as the blade sliced through nothing but empty space. Time seemed to slow down as a surge of adrenaline coursed through my veins. In an instant, a strange energy surged within me, a power I had never felt before. A bolt of electricity seemed to connect with my attacker, sending him flying backward, crashing into a stack of wooden crates.
I stood there, bewildered and shaken, watching the assailant groaning in pain. It was clear that he had underestimated me, his cold, hateful eyes filled with disbelief, searching for answers as to why his attempt had failed.
Word got around quickly about the failed assassination. Rumors spread like wildfire through the underbelly of the city. They called me "The Immortal," as stories of my survival reached the ears of those who wished me harm. Fear gripped their hearts, realizing that there was something beyond their comprehension going on.
Days turned into weeks, and the attempts on my life persisted. Assassins of various skills and backgrounds sought me out, always leaving empty-handed. In each encounter, my strange power grew stronger, my resistance to harm became more pronounced. It seemed as if the universe itself was conspiring to keep me alive.
Curiosity consumed me, and I delved into ancient texts, searching for an explanation. My search eventually led me to an old, forgotten prophecy. It spoke of a chosen one, a person endowed with supernatural protection, destined to rise against the forces of darkness and protect humanity. The prophecy mentioned an ancient talisman that would awaken these powers.
Guided by my newfound purpose, I embarked on a quest to find the talisman. It took me to the far reaches of the Earth, traversing treacherous terrains and facing unimaginable dangers. Finally, after months of searching, I found it - an unassuming amulet hidden deep within a hidden temple in the mountains of Tibet.
As I clutched the amulet, a surge of energy coursed through me, intertwining with the familiar power within. I realized that this was the key that unlocked my true potential, amplifying my abilities and ensuring my survival against all odds.
Armed with my newfound strength, I returned to the city where my pursuit began. The shadows that had once sought my demise now scattered at the mere mention of my name. I became a legend, a symbol of hope for those who could not defend themselves against the darkness.
In time, I realized that my powers were not meant solely for my own survival but to protect others. So, I pledged to use my abilities for the greater good, devoting myself to fighting injustice, to vanquishing those who threatened innocent lives.
From that day forward, I went not as the scared young 23-year-old who escaped their first deathly encounter, but as the immovable force, the guardian of the weak. And those who dared defy me, quickly learned that the second time around, I was more than ready to face them.
