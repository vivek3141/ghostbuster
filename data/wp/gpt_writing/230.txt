In the dim light of the evening shade,
I walked alone on the deserted street.
My footsteps echoed, piercing the silence,
As I clutched my coat against the cold.
A figure emerged, lurking in the shadows,
Their eyes glinting with a sinister gleam.
Fear gripped me, numbing my senses,
Suffocating the air, tightening my chest.
Heart pounding, I quickened my pace,
Each step urging me closer to safety.
But fate had different plans in store,
As darkness enveloped my trembling form.
Suddenly, a sharp pain pierced through me,
A blade slicing through flesh and bone.
Searing agony consumed my every being,
As life slowly drained from my fragile frame.
My heart, once filled with hope and dreams,
Now beats its final, mournful refrain.
Unseen tears mix with the crimson stain,
As my spirit soars away, forever untamed.
Now, let me turn the hands of time,
Through the eyes of a heartless soul.
Unfeeling, with a twisted sense of purpose,
A killer's thoughts begin to unfold.
I lurk in the shadows, hidden from sight,
As their naive steps echo through the night.
A macabre dance, a play of dominance,
The prey unknowing, caught in my trance.
My eyes, filled with a malevolent fire,
I follow their every move, filled with desire.
To taste the thrill, the power that it brings,
To silence their existence, to hear their pleas.
Their heart pounds, a rhythm I adore,
A symphony of fear, resounding in my core.
With every step they take, they draw me near,
Closer to the act that fuels my darkest fear.
In my grip, a blade gleams with malice,
A deadly tool, my desire's catalyst.
One swift strike, a dance of steel and flesh,
I claim my victory, leaving behind a mess.
Their life, extinguished, forevermore,
As their spirit fades, helpless and sore.
I revel in the power, the dominance achieved,
As darkness descends, the world deceived.
Now, as the wicked tale unravels,
Between victim and killer, the bond unshackles.
Life taken, life forced to flee,
A chilling reminder of our humanity.
