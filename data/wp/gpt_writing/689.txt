Once upon a time, in a quiet little town,
There lived a man named Charlie, with a face full of frown.
It happened one day, beneath the full moon's light,
That poor Charlie received a curse so tight.
He woke up that morning, feeling a bit strange,
No matter what he said, his words had to change.
Rhymes flowed effortlessly from his speech,
A peculiar curse, beyond his reach.
With a heavy heart, Charlie went to his job,
A typewriter salesman, his career he did sob.
His boss was a stern man, with a warming scowl,
But Charlie had to inform him, let out a howl.
"Dear Mr. Higgins, I'm afraid I must say,
A curse has befallen me, in a peculiar way.
My words are now bound by rules most tight,
I speak only in rhymes, from morning till night."
Mr. Higgins stared at Charlie, a mix of annoyance and shock,
Wondering if his employee had gone off the block.
But after a moment, his stern face softened with grace,
He chuckled and said, "Well, Charlie, it's quite the embrace."
Next, it was time to face his loving spouse,
Charlie couldn't help but worry, the curses he'd arouse.
He sat her down, heart pounding in his chest,
Hoping their relationship wouldn't be put to the test.
"My dear wife, I confess a conundrum severe,
A curse has taken hold of me, it's rhyming I fear.
All my words, be they simple or profound,
Must be spoken in rhyme till the curse unwinds."
She blinked at him, a quizzical look upon her face,
Then burst into laughter, embracing the embrace.
"Charlie, my love, you always find a way,
To light up my world, even in this peculiar way."
Lastly, it was time for Charlie's evening class,
An art teacher's job, making sculptures from glass.
As he stood before his students, unsure what to do,
He took a deep breath and knew they'd see this through.
"Dear students, I bear news of a different kind,
A curse has found me, playing tricks with my mind.
My words now rhyme, it's the only way I speak,
But art knows no bounds, it's something we can seek."
His students were amused, giggling at his rhymes,
But Charlie's passion for art, they recognized in due time.
They sculpted with laughter, dancing in rhyme,
Exploring their creativity, a most enchanting climb.
Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months,
Charlie's curse became part of his life's stunts.
But as time went on, he saw the blessing in disguise,
Through the curse's shackles, his spirit did rise.
For Charlie's rhymes brought joy to those around,
His wit and humor, a treasure they found.
No longer burdened by the curse he obtained,
He embraced it with grace, in a world unrestrained.
And so, dear friends, let this tale remind,
That even the darkest curses can be entwined.
For in the face of limitation, resilience we'll bare,
And bloom amidst chaos, with love's tender care.
