In a realm far beyond the confines of mortal perception, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse were tasks with their eternal duty—to bring forth the end of all things when the time was right. War, Famine, Pestilence, and Death had embarked on countless journeys together, leaving nothing but desolation in their wake. But one fateful day, Death, the most relentless of them all, had gone missing.
The remaining three horsemen found themselves in a state of utter confusion and despair. Their powerful aura dimmed, and their rides became listless without Death to guide them. The balance of their task had been disrupted, leaving them no choice but to embark on a quest to find a suitable replacement.
With eyes of burning fury, War led the relentless search, leaving behind a trail of blood and chaos as they scoured the earthly realms. Famine, gaunt and skeletal, followed closely, his withered hands extending in desperation towards those who could fill the void. Lastly, Pestilence, her presence marked by the stench of decay, wrapped her diseased tendrils around every inhabited corner of the world, seeking one who possessed the twisted darkness they required.
Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months, but the search proved fruitless. They encountered countless beings driven by cruelty and malice, but none possessed the wickedness capable of becoming the harbinger of Death. The three horsemen became increasingly disheartened, realizing that finding a successor to Death was an impossible task.
Just when all hope seemed lost, the horsemen stumbled upon a treacherous human settlement, hidden in the darkest corners of the Earth. This place was governed by a malevolent ruler, known only as Victor. His heart was consumed by sadism, and his rule was characterized by terror and suffering.
The horsemen observed Victor from afar, bearing witness to his monstrous acts—his desires interwoven with the suffering of others. They knew they had finally found what they were seeking, a human malicious enough to take the place of Death. However, they questioned whether handing such power to Victor would ultimately lead to the demise of everything they had sought to protect.
Cautiously, the three horsemen approached Victor, confronting him with their proposal. They explained the nature of their quest and the necessity for a successor, emphasizing the magnitude of the immortality that awaited him. Victor, enamored by their persuasive words, felt an insatiable curiosity intertwine with his sadistic desires. He agreed to become their replacement.
Adorning Victor with a cloak of darkness and a scythe forged in the fires of damnation, the Horsemen sealed his fate. Victor, now the fourth Horseman, felt a chilling sensation coursing through his veins, embracing the power and responsibility that came with his new role.
As War, Famine, Pestilence, and the new Horseman of Death embarked on their first mission together, an eerie harmony was restored among them. The dark quartet rode across desolate lands, carrying out their eternal task to bring about the end of existence. However, Victor, now consumed by the burden of his role, vowed to employ his newfound powers not only with sadism but also with a shred of compassion—hoping to alleviate the suffering he was set to inflict.
And so, a twisted harmony descended upon the realms as the Four Horsemen rode forth once more, bound forever by their cruel destiny.
