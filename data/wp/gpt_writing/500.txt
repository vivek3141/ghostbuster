Once upon a time in the small village of Scribbleton, there lived a young boy named Benjamin. Benjamin had a unique gift—he could bring life to words just by writing them down. His stories had the power to transport people to different worlds and ignite their imagination. 
One sunny morning, Benjamin sat on the grassy hill overlooking the village square, contemplating which prompt to choose for his next adventure. Other than personal preference, he pondered, what criteria should he use to select a prompt? Suddenly, he noticed something peculiar happening in the village square.
Curiosity piqued, Benjamin hurried down the hill and found a crowd surrounding a wooden box. The box, weathered and worn from time, was said to contain magical coins. Each coin held a prompt that could determine a person's fate—be it great or small. People from all walks of life gathered to choose their destiny.
Intrigued, Benjamin joined the crowd. As he patiently waited, the townsfolk excitedly drew coins and shared their chosen prompts. Some described captivating adventures, while others conveyed deep emotions or moral dilemmas. Watching the expressions on their faces, Benjamin realized how the prompts captivated their hearts and made them reflect on their own lives.
Finally, it was Benjamin's turn at the wooden box. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and reached inside. As his fingers brushed against the cold coins, he felt a jolt of electricity running up his arm. One coin seemed to vibrate against his touch, as if it was waiting for him to choose it.
Benjamin pulled out the coin, and before him, the prompt appeared:
"In a world where words have lost their meaning, write a story that restores their power."
A surge of excitement coursed through Benjamin's veins. He realized that beyond personal preference, the prompts he should choose were those that would have an impact and resonate with others. He didn't want just any story; he wanted to craft tales that would reignite the magic of words.
Determined, Benjamin rushed back to his small cottage and sat at his worn-out desk. Placing the prompt coin before him, he envisioned a world without the power of words. He envisioned people restrained by silence, unable to express themselves fully or connect with others. 
With a flourish of his pen, Benjamin began to write. Words flowed from his mind through his fingers and onto the blank parchment. He spun fantastical tales of valiant heroes and enchanting lands, tales that danced upon the page and breathed life into the once-lifeless world.
As Benjamin finished his story, a remarkable thing happened. The villagers of Scribbleton gathered around him, their hearts open and their spirits awakened. They embraced the power of his words, understanding the depth and beauty behind each carefully woven sentence. 
Word spread, and soon people from far and wide came to hear Benjamin's stories. They realized that prompts were not merely chosen based on personal preference, but rather with the intention of crafting stories that could change lives.
In the end, Benjamin discovered that the power of choosing prompts lay not only in personal preference but also in the ability to uncover prompts that resonate with the deepest corners of people's hearts. He continued to select prompts that called to him, ones that would breathe life back into the forgotten magic of words, and through his stories, the world rediscovered the power of storytelling, one tale at a time.
