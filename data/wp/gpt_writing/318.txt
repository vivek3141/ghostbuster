It was at this desolate crossroad that the story took shape.
Simon, an unassuming middle-aged man, waited by the gas pump, his beady eyes hiding an insidious secret. Known only to a few, Simon was a cunning serial killer who preyed on hitchhikers foolish enough to accept his rides. As the embodiment of terror, he relished in the unsuspecting souls who fell victim to his dark desires.
Meanwhile, on the opposite side of town, Marshall, a connoisseur of chaos, mingled like a chameleon in society's tapestry. Alongside his well-tailored suits and charming demeanor, he hid his true nature. Marshall was a serial killer hell-bent on exterminating those who offered him rides, an act he saw as an invitation to his macabre theater.
Sensing the twilight's embrace, Simon prepared to embark on his nocturnal hunt. With his bloodstained hands hidden beneath a pair of leather gloves, he set a trap, parking his glistening black sedan just outside the gas station. His shadows seemed to whisper their eagerness, igniting his anticipation.
Little did Simon know, fate had other plans in store that night. Marshall, equally prepared to unleash his wrath upon a new victim, arrived at the same forsaken crossroad. Swathed in the cloak of darkness, he looked around, a wicked smile creeping upon his lips as he spotted Simon's car.
Intrigued by his unforeseen rival, Marshall decided to play Simon's game. He maneuvered his vehicle with skill, parking it flank to flank with his counterpart's automobile. Hidden from sight, they observed each other, adrenaline coursing through their veins. It was an eerie dance between predators.
With synchronized precision, the serial killers stealthily exited their respective vehicles, shards of moonlight illuminating their sinister presence. Simon's eyes narrowed as he realized the audacity of his fellow killer. He had underestimated the twisted mind of his counterpart.
Simultaneously, the lethal vortex drew them closer. Cold sweats emphasized their anticipation as they crept towards each other. Each step was calculated, each breath fueling their thirst for supremacy. There, in the midst of the vast twilight, their paths collided.
And so begun these two men's twilight duel, igniting an eternal flame casting shadows upon the once-pure road. With knives at the ready, their closed fists unsheathed their weapons as they circled each other, the moon basking in the unholy feast that was about to unfold.
For hours, the dance continued, their depraved minds striving for mastery over life and death. Slashing coursing through the sharp night air, bodies twisted, mimicking the sick duet of a stormy sky. Their eyes never wavered, each attempting to ensnare his counterpart in an unbreakable grip.
But as fate would have it, neither emerged victorious. As the night crept closer to dawn, their tiresome hearts gave a signal of their own accord. As they crashed onto the ground, gasping for air, their bodies healed, their wounds an ancient declaration narrated through exhaled breaths.
Both killers lay before each other, glazed eyes witnessing a new dawn, life pulsating within their veins. An unspoken understanding passed between them, shattering their webs of deceit. The years of being hunted by a society bent on vengeance had finally converged in an unexpected alliance.
It was as if their dark minds had collided and created a newfound kingdom of terror within their souls. Only time would reveal the true depths of their unholy truce.
In that twilight's embrace, a symphony of evil had been unleashed, drowning out the faint whispers of society's forgotten souls. And so, they vowed to continue their bloody duel, their twisted game of hide and seek forever ravenous, forever unsatiated.
Locked in their eternal twilight of darkness, the crossroad would forever bear witness to their unholy waltz, a macabre stage forever embraced by shadows. United in wickedness, their dance would serve as a chilling reminder to the world of the evil that lurked in the night's embrace. A timeless battle poised at the edge of time. In the end, the crossroad became a ghostly mirror reflecting humanity's darkest desires through the one choice no one could ever unmake.

Hello, it's me, Philip. Welcome to Horror Hill. This evening we begin our series of stories that make up a multi-chapter light horror short drama. As always, I'm thrilled to parade out these tales for you to enjoy amongst the stars in the dark. And if you're keen for this, you'll be pleased to learn that we have an hour-long feature presentation up our sleeve. So turn up your volumes, close the blinds, and fasten your seat beats. We're heading off into the night together. Release the parking brake, and enjoy the ride. But be warned, things will get nasty. We begin tonight with the chapters of Betrayal and Clementine as our two main characters discover the veracity of the situation they've encountered. The first dirt I like is titled: "This is not an empty body bag." Chapter one. Marie was her name. Marie Granger. Detective, PI and the purveyor of some of the worst cries imaginable. Not in her line of work, but in her years of being herself. Marie had seen how wickedly gruesome the world could turn. It had taken the life of her father when she was just a little kid, and soon after her mother from sickness when she dove into awful things to drown out her grief. Yet she persisted. Her folks would be proud to know that their aspiring author daughter had become a published writer. Sure, she wrote mostly true crime journalism, but every now and then, they published one of her novels. Detective novels full of intrigue, damsels held hostage, and cops who would always save the day. Get the girl, and forget that Marie Granger ever existed. These bad boys were the Sam Spades of the late-night variety show. Though all folks had thought about the crumbling literature industry, at least detective novels were always a seminar of escape for the down and out sort of folks that needed an off-switch for a period of time. Marie was such sort of folks that needed such breaks. Badly. It was getting to the point where all cases sent her way were starting to become mumbo-jumbo Yashod out by the authorities as hopeless. She had been told three hours ago to investigate a serial killer by the snoozy-saying LA County Sheriff's Department. That's why she was standing over this lifeless corpse, trying to make sense of where and why. Inside the porcelain intestines of Los Angeles, Marie had noticed a trend mostly blue-collar workers kidnapped and then dumped outside their neighborhood. This particular body laid down on Eugene Paddick's favorite fishing spot in Crete. Their names were either Joe, Randy, or Bill also. "I'm Agent Pete Decker. LAPD, how's it going there, Miss Granger?" Decker asked. "We really need your help on this one." "It's going alright. I suppose it could have been worse," Marie said offhandedly. "Yeah. Try this on for size, Granger. This victim had an anonymous call 20 minutes after the body went dead. Then into a nearby pay phone. He said he'd never met such a pretty girl when we told him to follow through. But he managed to flip around the front lines momentarily before," Decker cleared his throat and at length continued, "cranking the handbrake, slamming into a metal guardrail to propel him through the windshield over the cheese grater metal on top of a Subaru. Marie grasped her face gaping wide open. No shattered glass found anywhere, and the seatbelt looks like it was undone. She sobs. "You're telling me, Marie, that this dead boy has fingerprints lightly dusted all over his station wagon. He's been a corpse for at least two hours. Oh, and did I mention the radio programmed in weak aluminum structures of the nearby fence and debris from what could have been major brain damage when flying through the ceiling of that soup kitchen for all the homeless people in the neighborhood, Landing Square and Marie's spaghetti and meatballs? Marie promptly stood up and unlocked the aluminum van full of Gregson's equipment. "Let's get to work, Decker. Great Scott, get out of here. One for the road, will ya?" Decker rummaged around for a baggie packed with Mary Jane. "No." Marie snapped. "I need you, Decker. This is the biggest case of my damn life. We can't play some hard-boiled video game in a bar, in a strip mall, full of impended self-doubt." Decker begrudgingly cast the joint into a foul plume of smoke. Judicially travelled into the darkness, where hope goes to die. "Come along if you must, you damn scamp. My days are numbered." Marie began unlocking the van and loading her camera equipment onto a government-issued military van. Last seen in the days of NAMM this classic metal phone booth had an odd, sliding cabin door. The kind homicide detectives slide their detectives inside of, while cruisers hover behind them, awaiting an escort. Marie hated every single moment entering through the back and feeling her temper B.E.R.B up ever so slightly. Decker followed along idly, whistling all the single ladies with the occasional Vince Guaraldi making for a whirligig of noise, spinning around Clare invading Marie's cocoon. "I'm sorry, what did you say, Decker?" Marie closed the mini P.E.N. vest revealing her badge, slides in with a peculiar, matter-of-fact voice. Decker tried again. "I said, I'm sorry for everything that I've said. Marc Jerry's. I want you to know, you're beautiful just the way you were. Even in the case of a drive-by. Marie, this time pleading, ignorance. "No mention of any scars which I've acquired in the line of duty." Decker waits a moment before exploding with joy. "Yes, that's all a thing of duty. But Dee misses the point. You're so beautiful. How are you single and us together?" Marie opens her mouth to reason, but she's gobbled up. "Think of it this way. I mean, just quickly, so we can get investigating." Marie quickly counters. "Think of it this way. No matter what happens, no matter how insane this case gets, and no matter how insane you make it, we can revel in the smaller parts of human connection that are just meaningless to the task of dissecting a serial killer." Decker smirks at her. "Lowers soft in your average cat Facebook video. Playing on the hard-disgusting loop in the detective's mind she had endured for many years now. She had built up what she expected to be a barrier of walls that virtually any human being should ever have seen. 'Oh, I'm hearing you, Granger, and forget the case. Forget the rest of what we were hired to do, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the bounce house. We're gonna jump, jump, and jump some more.' In the small hours of the AM, back was the sun, boiling milk, and everything else that accompanied her way before the FBI signed and sold this creep back to LA. As the sun dipped into what could also describe the chef's saliva dripping off his upper lip, vampire himself, Marie lit a cigarette and admired the thrums of the locked box. A bastard admits there is nothing to it, that he is an architect of death, an unimaginable architect of these crimes. The Carthage Killers, Marie, you see, sand, cackle, and pork at hanging carcasses. Their pleas are muted words. Stop trying to tell men otherwise, Marie. How are you investigating this serial killer if the serial killer is too crippling to investigate? Corrections, old age you say? Marie stares at the red semi paint that reads as "Supposedtoreg Returned metal bars." One thrown on the back bumper of a black coupe, she knows those are her nerves being crushed proverbial sheets of protrusion. Palms swing, spin with cocaine. Marie ascends into the back of the civilian port-a-john outside sunny Castaic. She hasn't slept and her skin has been sunburned for the better part of these awful crimes. She recognizes all the clues, all of his mind traps. "Come on, Marie," Decker says, "Help me out here. We need to identify an explicit motive for the killings. We need them to be something for future reference. We must understand why and we cannot understand why until we understand how." Marie crashes on the ledge of the Rolls-Royce hood. Her eyes swelling from the UV rays plugging her rare delicate soul. "Help, help, help." She whirls around and falls down to rest. Given the desire to look intelligent, given the immediate critique of her own thoughts as somewhat pessimistic or fundamentally boring. In which case, won't you allow me this? Given that she no longer matters anymore, that the thought of this killer needing money more than sex. Pulling up in vans, pulling up and forcing scissors in someone's mouth. Such a merciless world, considering how repetitive the crimes, the false hope she played hard sell to. Especially when it's going to be months until she realizes these Manson girls are just sick people looking for your simple messages. When she'll wish she figured out sooner that some folks scream when they read the news. "Miss Granger," Detective Pete Decker gabs and turns his peaked cap backward. "Are you alright?" "Ready when you are, Pete." Marie's fingertips pulsating to make one of the lines of "Tiny Dancer" at the other as "Let the Sunshine In" from the salt in her arm and dad in her mother. That's Pete's problem right there, quote unquote. Too much self-medicating sugar for a throat that's been forced away from emotional outbursts. Marie closes her eyes and tunes out anthems of rebellion hushed in the back of her car. She notices that the ironic look between herself and Decker is one the public would glare at (some deranged entity lived in perhaps a stone's toss away) and that the squares of Mall America would look at them and pretend to understand. Pretend to wave them away with a Lysol wiped hand, and in that inevitable scraping away jerking away, find closure. Decker realized, Marie smelled the salt, and she knows that nothing else can ever carry on past this. Body bags filling up with thou provideth Marie the gift of living from simple glory. Fleece from a world of terror, or nightmares of forgetful people who don't quite know which side of their street they parked on the car the night they unhooked themselves from their own souls. It's Decker's buddy this time, a triple homicide with a capital P, Marie fears. No, no, yes, Decker comes up to girth while maintaining a boyish appearance with a full beard that's starting to turn into a girls washed out eyelid. It's a car chase, beautiful. Let's impose that automobile. Oh, hell's bells, Granger. This one'll pull-- "Lo, Miss Clemons," Decker began, "that tone which almost made Marie's pupils swell to a degree where Now might be a great time to begin writing. There are a couple moments in any detective's life where things go right." "Oh, and cue detective of the year." Marie had said once, and Decker coughed and splattered, spewing (Klaas noise) heavenly dribble. Nevertheless, Marie smiled. Or was it a smile? Decker would have been expected to say, trying that terrible noise in his throat again, giving away Piroet's star bound beyond Salvation's blistering comet. By the way, you've got a body, a dream made of heroic stories piled on top of cowardice, and it's somewhere like a twisted mosaic of gentle dancing in LA. Simon Dekker sneezes, and Marie tries to remind him of an episode of Psych that they could remember. "Really? That was what he wanted to answer with? Let's tender this frilly teret." "F off, Deckey." Dekker's heart sinks. Marie has been known for her solace streams, cameras, videos, and other assorted tropes that float in and out of serial murder classrooms. "Let's get to the ball game, as the infamous old Irishman would say. At recess we all knew what happened. But even those factos with a different reason for being there will be ignored. And even then it turns out, the only logical outcome, Amory thinks, F off."
The irony Marie thought, that these last rays of golden sunlight eventually filter elsewhere and she will have to seize opportunity from the lamb said beforehand.
"Ah,," Deckard hints, down in the depths of this bisque of murder enigmas, observing crime scenes through the elementary walls of her mind.
The tiniest Roman something long since lost to the age of decline. Still a glimmer, sometimes Marie only hears the vowels and consonants rummaging in her endless treasure chest of meaning.
Saying, "Don't touch me, I'm empty," or sometimes when she is met with force, there is a fleeting, merely temporary streak in her heart as she visits a sleepy attic.
Fragility lingers, washing in and out with tired, rancid dust that ascends from the situation like electricity slipping or spritely shouting within a tornado.
Then the hues that were already so pronounced are brought once more to life for reason without jest.
Marie, we don't have much time. The door revealed his soft charcoal gray counter-body beside all imaginative reasonings.
Enough, Marie whispers herself, mostly, in a hushed whisper behind closed doors with only smoke floating above Creaky Boards stretched meaningfully below.
As Marie gently slides down the detective's rough exterior, she hopes for a whisper to have him feel the motivation necessary to keep him steady in his pursuits, knowing that this time her fire goes out.
She never knew the impact her quick-stop journey's charity car would be.
She never knew that it would lead her here to investigate, and that, as soon as she would disappear, it wouldn't take much for those nameless detectives to unearth something already.
Something on a psychological level which can only be described as occasionally terrifying.
