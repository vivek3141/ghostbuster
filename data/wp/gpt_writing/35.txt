As I boarded the bus, I noticed something peculiar. Among the bustling crowd, standing beside each passenger, were ethereal entities—slender figures adorned in shimmering white garments. I had always possessed a unique perceptiveness, a gift or perhaps a curse—an ability to see soul escorts, celestial beings that appeared when someone's life was about to meet its end. This supernatural sight allowed me to peer into the invisible realm, to witness the connection between mortals and the inevitable embrace of death.
Over the years, my encounters with soul escorts had become somewhat commonplace. However, never before had I witnessed an entire bus filled with these otherworldly guides. A shudder ran down my spine, causing my heart to flutter with apprehension. I could sense an eerie stillness enveloping the bus, while the escorts lingered protectively around their assigned souls.
Curiosity, coupled with a heavy dose of concern, pushed me to discreetly survey the souls encircled by these celestial guardians. None of the passengers appeared different or distressed in any way, and the escorts exhibited a gentle and compassionate aura. Although rare, I knew it was possible for escorts to anticipate an imminent tragedy that could affect more than a single individual. However, anxiety gnawed at my insides as I wondered if this diverse group of souls shared a collective fate, silently awaiting the unknown.
Suddenly, a sobering thought struck me—perhaps I was the only one who could perceive these escorts. Was I meant to intervene somehow, to save them from their impending doom? Doubt plagued my mind, overshadowing my desire to help. Yet I couldn't simply dismiss the weight of responsibility that rested upon my shoulders. The lives of these individuals were at stake, teetering on the precipice between life and the great beyond.
Summoning courage, I discreetly made my way through the narrow aisle. A whisper of wind brushed against my skin as I cautiously approached an elderly gentleman seated near the back of the bus. His features were etched with wisdom, his eyes brimming with a twinkle of mirth. Standing beside him was an escort—a regal figure emanating an aura of tranquillity. I swallowed hard, realizing the gravity of the impending destiny that loomed before him.
Summoning all my strengths, I leaned towards the elderly man and spoke softly, "Sir, forgive my intrusion, but I believe there might be imminent danger looming before us. I...I have this unique ability to see these...escorts that surround us." My voice trailed off, unsure of how he would react.
Surprisingly, the gentleman smiled warmly, his eyes meeting mine in understanding. "My dear young observer, thank you for your vigilance. Rest assured, both my soul and those of my fellow passengers shall be embraced by the escorts tonight."
Confusion swirled within me, not fully comprehending his words. "But... what do you mean? How can you be so sure?"
The elderly man's voice resonated softly through the bus as he answered, "We, the escort-filled souls you see tonight, are members of a movement—a collective of individuals harboring hope, compassion, and faith. Tonight, we shall embark on a journey—leaving this world together to forge a path towards a brighter future."
His words echoed within the confines of my mind, unraveling a truth previously hidden from my comprehension. The bus, once filled with fear, took on an aura of serenity. The escorts seemed to emit an ethereal glow, their purpose finally unveiled. In their presence, I discovered not the inevitable demise of these individuals, but the profound understanding that death and new beginnings were intrinsically intertwined.
As the bus trundled along its usual route, I found solace in witnessing the tranquillity of these so-called escorts. In that moment, the fear that once gripped me had been replaced by awe—a newfound appreciation for the delicate tapestry connecting life and death. And as we continued on our journey, towards the unknown, I vowed to honor the legacy of those who would soon transcend this realm—by embracing life, unburdened by the fear of the inevitable, one soul at a time.
