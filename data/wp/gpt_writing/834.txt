I just learned what a drabble is. A drabble is an extremely short work of fiction of exactly one hundred words in length. So, let's drabble...
Once upon a time, there was a tiny seed known as Drabble. He wanted to explore the world beyond the soil. With great determination, Drabble began his journey, pushing through the earth, embracing the sunlight for the first time.
He grew, tiny and fragile at first, but he persevered. Raindrop friends visited him, showering him with love and nourishment. Slowly, Drabble transformed into a marvelous flower, spreading vibrant petals to brighten the world.
But as the seasons shifted, so did Drabble's destiny. He wilted, withered, and returned to the earth. Yet, his story lingered, reminding us that even the shortest lives can leave lasting imprints on the hearts of those they touch.
