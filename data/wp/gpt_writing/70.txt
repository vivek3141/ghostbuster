In the depths of the underworld, where darkness and chaos reigned, there existed an end-game level 50 god known as Azrael. With his immense power and unmatched prowess, he commanded the underworld and ruled over its inhabitants. Adorned in armor made of blackened flames and wielding a sword ablaze with unholy fire, Azrael was a force to be reckoned with.
However, as mighty as he was, Azrael found himself facing an unexpected dilemma. A new player, a mere level 1, had entered the underworld and had taken an interest in him. Despite the vastness of the realm, this player seemed determined to pester Azrael relentlessly. The novice player would approach Azrael, wooden sword in hand, and strike him repeatedly, always aiming for his ankle.
At first, Azrael simply ignored the feeble attempts of the level 1 player. After all, what harm could a wooden sword do to an end-game god? But the persistent pestering began to wear on Azrael's patience, disrupting his peace and solitude. Unable to fathom why this newcomer insisted on challenging him, Azrael decided it was time to confront the player.
One day, when the level 1 player approached him, hastily swinging his wooden sword, Azrael swiftly halted him. With a flick of his finger, he cast a minor spell that brought the player to his knees, immobilizing him. Staring down at the novice with a mix of curiosity and annoyance, Azrael spoke in a deep voice that resonated through the underworld.
"Why do you persist in bothering me, player? To what end do you strike at an end-game god with a mere wooden sword?"
The player, visibly shaken by Azrael's commanding presence, managed to stammer out a reply. "I-I seek guidance, my lord. I wish to become as mighty as you, to conquer this underworld."
Azrael's brow furrowed in surprise. No player had ever approached him seeking guidance, let alone shown such audacity. While his power was usually reserved for his subjects, there was something intriguing about this persistent level 1 player. He released the spell, allowing the player to regain his footing.
"Very well," Azrael said, his voice tinged with curiosity. "If you possess enough courage to face the perils of this realm, then I shall mentor you. But heed my warning: the path to true power is fraught with challenges and sacrifices."
And so, Azrael took the level 1 player under his wing. They journeyed through the treacherous underworld, facing formidable creatures and enduring countless battles. The novice learned valuable lessons in strategy, bravery, and resilience under the guidance of the mighty god.
Over time, the level 1 player grew stronger, accumulating levels and honing his skills, until he could wield a sword as formidable as his mentor's. The once persistent pest had transformed into a formidable adversary. But instead of challenging Azrael, he stood beside him as an equal, their bond forged through countless battles and shared experiences.
Through their journey, Azrael discovered the true purpose behind the level 1 player's incessant pestering. The novice had seen in Azrael an opportunity, not just for power, but for guidance and mentorship. And in return, Azrael found a worthy companion, someone whose tenacity had impressed him against all odds.
With his newfound apprentice at his side, Azrael's dominion over the underworld flourished. Together, they brought balance and harmony to a realm once shrouded in chaos. And in time, the level 1 player became a god in his own right, fiercely loyal to the one who had once been pestered by a simple wooden sword.
