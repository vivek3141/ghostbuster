Submitted by Santa Claus
Once upon a time, in the magical realm of the North Pole, everything was buzzing with excitement. The elves were diligently working on toys, snowflakes gracefully danced through the air, and jolly old Santa Claus himself sat in his cozy study, preparing for the most wonderful time of the year.
But amidst the joy and cheer, a strange incident occurred that shook Santa's world. One chilly evening, Santa was pleasantly surprised to discover an enchanting note tucked inside his red velvet stocking. The note simply read, "Submitted by Santa Claus." Astonished and perplexed, he studied the message carefully.
Santa pondered over this peculiar note, wondering who might have left it. His elves had been in the workshop all day, focused on the toys, and Mrs. Claus was busy baking cookies for the Christmas Eve feast. Curiosity piqued, Santa decided to embark on a mysterious investigation.
He put on his spectacles, adjusted his red hat, and ventured out into the snow-covered village. Questions filled his mind as he approached the first house, their chimney emitting a gentle stream of smoke. He gently knocked on their door, and a young girl answered.
"Hello, my dear. I am Santa Claus, and I received a note today that says it was submitted by me. Do you have any idea who might have sent it?" Santa inquired in his booming voice.
The little girl's eyes widened with amazement as she recognized Santa standing at her doorstep. "Santa Claus! Oh, wow. I don't know who could have sent it, but I do know someone who believes in you very much. It's my grandmother."
Santa thanked the girl and set off to find her grandmother, who lived nearby. The grandmother welcomed Santa with a warm smile and a twinkle of recognition in her eyes. Santa shared the mysterious note with her, explaining how it magically appeared in his stocking.
The grandmother's eyes brimmed with tears as she unfolded a weathered, yellowed piece of paper from her pocket. "Oh, Santa, this is a letter I wrote to you when I was just a little girl. I poured my heart and soul into it, but due to unforeseen circumstances, it never reached you. Over the years, I kept it safe, just dreaming of the day it would find its way to you."
Santa read the heartfelt words on the letter, filled with the innocence and wonder of a child's imagination. The grandmother's dreams of long ago were penned on the page, capturing the joy and hope that Christmas invoked. Santa was deeply moved by the grandmother's dedication.
As he bid farewell to the grandmother, Santa pondered the remarkable journey this letter had taken, seemingly over vast stretches of time. The magic of Christmas was powerful indeed, transcending generations. In the end, it was this love and faith that allowed the note to find its way back to Santa Claus.
Back in his study, Santa carefully placed the letter inside a special golden envelope, gently sealing it with a touch of magic. He wrote a heartfelt response, thanking the grandmother for her unwavering belief, and promising that her faith would forever be rewarded.
On Christmas Eve, when Santa flew across the night sky in his sleigh, he made a special stop at the grandmother's house. Shrouded in moonlight, he placed the golden envelope beneath her tree, knowing that even now, her childhood dreams would come true.
Years passed, the story of the "Submitted by Santa Claus" note became a legend in the North Pole, whispered amongst the families who celebrated Christmas. The faith and love of a little girl, nurtured by her grandmother, had touched the heart of Santa Claus, proving that the magic of belief could overcome time and distance.
And so, the spirit of Christmas continued to endure, woven into the very fabric of the North Pole. Santa Claus smiled, knowing that this incredible journey had taught him that the innocence and goodness of the world truly made every Christmas miraculous.
