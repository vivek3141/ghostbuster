As I approached the imposing edifice of the mental institution, I couldn't help but feel a tinge of uneasiness creeping up my spine. It was my first night delivering pizzas to this place, and the stories I had heard about the lock-down ward were enough to make anyone think twice about stepping foot inside. But as a broke college student, I needed the extra cash, and delivering pizzas seemed like an easy way to make ends meet.
I clambered out of my car, pizza box in hand, and made my way toward the entrance. The dimly lit corridor seemed to stretch on forever, each step increasing my trepidation. My heart raced as I reached the door of the lock-down ward, adorned with multiple locks and warning signs. Gritting my teeth, I pushed open the heavy door and entered the eerie atmosphere.
The institutional smell hit me like a waveâ€”sterility mixed with a hint of despair. The flickering fluorescent lights cast a haunting glow on the pale, gaunt faces of the patients who roamed the tiled hallway. Their vacant stares followed my every move, unsettling me further. Taking a deep breath, I pushed forward, mustering all my courage.
Room 312 was my destination, and as I neared it, a gruff voice called out, "Pizza delivery!" I raised the box, ready to fulfill my duty and swiftly escape this disconcerting place. The door creaked open, revealing a small room dimly illuminated by a solitary lamp. A man sat at a table, his wild hair and disheveled appearance confirming his presence as a patient.
As I handed him the pizza, he smirked, saying, "Their tricks won't fool me this time."
His words caught me off guard, concern creeping into my voice as I replied, "Uh, sorry, sir, I have to go. Enjoy your meal."
Before I could retreat, a firm hand grasped my shoulder, spinning me around. My heart raced as I met the eyes of an orderly, his face contorted in a mixture of frustration and confusion. "Nice try," he growled, his grip tightening, "get back to your room."
Room? What on earth was he talking about? My mind raced to find an explanation for this absurd situation. Could there have been some sort of mix-up? A prank, perhaps?
Frantically, I managed to stutter, "Wait, I'm not a patient! I'm just a pizza delivery guy!"
The orderly squinted at me suspiciously, as if questioning my sanity. "A pizza delivery guy? No one's ever made it this far before. You better come with me."
He led me down the endless corridors, past locked doors and peering eyes. The hustle and bustle of the institution seemed to intensify as we walked, the patients growing increasingly agitated. Finally, we reached a small office tucked away in a forgotten corner of the ward.
Sitting me down inside, the orderly disappeared for what felt like an eternity. My mind raced with confusion, panic, and disbelief. Just as I was about to gather my courage and escape, a kindly-looking woman entered the room. She introduced herself as Dr. Anderson and explained that this incident was a grave misunderstanding.
It turned out that a patient, notorious for escaping and hiding among the staff, had somehow managed to trick his way into ordering a pizza in my name. Dr. Anderson profusely apologized for the confusion caused, insisting it was an isolated incident. She expressed her gratitude for my bravery in delivering meals to the patients, despite the unsettling environment.
As I left the office, my mind swirled with a whirlwind of emotions. The night had taken a bizarre turn, but it had also opened my eyes to a world I had never truly understood. From that day forward, I continued to deliver pizzas to the mental institution, seeing it not as a dark and menacing place, but as one filled with individuals who longed for a moment of connection, a slice of something ordinary in their extraordinary lives.
