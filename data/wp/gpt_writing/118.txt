Once upon a time, in a land far across the sea,
Lay an island full of marvels, where dragons roamed free.
Guarded by three fierce women, strong and unyielding,
Their spirits unmatched, their hearts ever revealing.
On this island of dragons, the sky was never gray,
Golden sunsets painted the horizon at the end of each day.
The dragons soared majestically, their wings stretched high,
Their scales glistening, casting an enchanting hue in the sky.
Anna, the first guardian, had a spirit fiery and bold,
Her sword gleamed like lightning, as stories of her courage were told.
With emerald eyes, she could pierce through any disguise,
Fighting for justice and truth, ignoring all the lies.
Elena, the second guardian, was swift like the wind,
Her bow and arrows, her virtue's truest kin.
With eyes like sapphire, sharp and keen,
Her aim was true, a warrior supreme.
And then came Maya, the third guardian, with a heart so kind,
With healing touch, she mended both body and mind.
Her eyes were like amethyst, gentle and calm,
She soothed the wounded, singing a healing psalm.
Together, they stood, the guardians three,
Protecting the island with fierce loyalty.
Their unity forged, their bond unbreakable,
Against any threat, they were undefeatable.
When ships sailed near, seeking treasures untold,
The shanty of the island, the sailors were told:
"Beware ye, oh mariner, approach with great care,
For an island of dragons, beyond compare.
Three fierce women guard it, with hearts full of flame,
Their strength and valor shall forever be their name.
Dare not disturb the dragons, their fire remains uncontained,
For those who provoke them shall forever be pained.
But if ye seek solace and are kind of heart,
They shall welcome ye with warmth, as daylight shall impart.
The island of wonders, a haven so true,
Where dragons and guardians live in harmony too."
And so, as the shanty spread throughout the waves,
Sailors who encountered the island, lived to tell the tales.
The island of dragons, bathed in mystery and might,
Guarded by three fierce women, noble in their fight.
