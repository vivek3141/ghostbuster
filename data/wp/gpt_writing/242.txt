My Dearest Lucy,
As I write this letter, the weight of the words bears heavy on my heart. I fear there is no easy way to say this, but I have become infected with a deadly virus. Its grip on me is relentless, and I have come to terms with my imminent death. I want you to know that my love for you will transcend time and space, even when I am gone.
When I first received the news, my mind was filled with fear and despair. Thoughts of leaving you without a goodbye haunted me. But slowly, as the days passed, acceptance settled within me. It is not an easy path to walk, accepting the inevitability of one's own demise, yet it has liberated me in a way I never thought possible.
Every day, as I wake up to another sunrise, I find solace in knowing that I still have precious moments to share my thoughts with you. These letters, my love, will be my voice when my physical presence is no longer. I hope that you find strength and comfort in the words that follow.
First and foremost, I want you to remember the happiness we shared. Our love was a radiant light that illuminated even the darkest corners of my heart. Holding you in my embrace, feeling your warmth against my skin, those are the memories that I will cherish until my last breath. Share those memories with our children, for they are a testament to what a beautiful life we built together.
Forgive me for any pain my departure may cause you. I implore you to remember that life, despite its fleeting nature, is a journey of profound beauty. Do not allow my absence to darken the beauty of your own existence. Instead, let it be a reminder that each day is a gift. Pursue your dreams fearlessly, Lucy. Fulfill the desires of your heart without hesitation, for life is too short to waste on regrets.
Know that it is not death which binds us, but love. Love has been our constant companion through the ups and downs of life, and it will continue to guide you after I am gone. Allow yourself to grieve, to mourn our loss together with our loved ones. But then, my dear Lucy, find the strength to rise above the pain, to embrace life with the determination we both possessed.
Remember that I will always be watching over you. In the quiet moments, when you feel an inexplicable warmth in your heart or find courage in the face of adversity, know that it is me, guiding you through the currents of life. Though our time together was far too short, our love was eternal, and love, my darling, is stronger than any virus or death itself.
I want to end this letter with a final plea. Live your life with an unyielding passion. Cherish the moments, both big and small. Hold our children close and nurture their dreams. Embrace the beauty of the world, for it is vast and full of wonders waiting to be discovered. Above all, never forget the love we shared.
Until we meet again, my love, hold on to the memories we have created. And remember, even in death, the love we share will never fade.
Forever yours,
John
